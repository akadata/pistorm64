dos.library/PathPart ]" border=0> NAME PathPart -- Returns a pointer to the end of the next-to-last (V36) component of a path. SYNOPSIS fileptr = PathPart( path ) D0 D1 STRPTR PathPart( STRPTR ) FUNCTION This function returns a pointer to the character after the next-to-last component of a path specification, which will normally be the directory name. If there is only one component, it returns a pointer to the beginning of the string. The only real difference between this and FilePart() is the handling of '/'. INPUTS path - pointer to an path string. May be relative to the current directory or the current disk. RESULT fileptr - pointer to the end of the next-to-last component of the path. EXAMPLE PathPart("xxx:yyy/zzz/qqq") would return a pointer to the last '/'. PathPart("xxx:yyy") would return a pointer to the first 'y').
