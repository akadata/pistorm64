(V36) SYNOPSIS co = CreateCxObj(type,arg1,arg2); D0 D0 A0 A1 CxObj *CreateCxObj(ULONG, LONG ,LONG); FUNCTION This function creates a commodity object of type 'type'. It is not proper to call this function directly. Each object creation routine except CxBroker() is defined as a macro in These are independently documented. All functions which operate on a commodity object are made with a reference to the thirty-two bit value returned by this function (or by CxBroker() ). INPUTS type - the type of object to create as defined in arg1 - first argument, meaning depends on 'type' arg2 - second argument, meaning depends on 'type' RESULTS co - a pointer to the new object or NULL if it could not be created. A NULL return indicates typically a lack of system memory. Minor problems in creating an object, such as providing a bad filter description to cx_lib/CxFilter() , typically don't cause failure, but are recorded in an internal error field in the new object which can be accessed via CxObjError() .
