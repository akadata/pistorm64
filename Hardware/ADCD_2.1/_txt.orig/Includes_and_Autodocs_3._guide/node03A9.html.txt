SYNOPSIS DrawImage( RastPort , Image , LeftOffset, TopOffset ) A0 A1 D0 D1 VOID DrawImage( struct RastPort *, struct Image *, WORD, WORD ); FUNCTION First, sets up the draw mode and pens in the RastPort according to the arguments of the Image structure. Then, moves the image data of the image argument into the RastPort , offset by the left and top offsets. This routine does window layer clipping if you pass your window's (layered) RastPort -- if you draw an image outside of your window, your imagery will be clipped at the window's edge. If you pass a (non-layered) screen RastPort , you MUST be sure your image is wholly contained within the rastport bounds. If the NextImage field of the image argument is non-NULL, the next image is rendered as well, and so on until some NextImage field is found to be NULL. INPUTS RastPort = pointer to the RastPort to receive image rendering Image = pointer to an image structure LeftOffset = the offset which will be added to the image's x coordinate TopOffset = the offset which will be added to the image's y coordinate RESULT None NOTES Intuition always has and will continue to assume there are at least as many planes of data pointed to by ImageData as there are '1' bits in the PlanePick field. Please ensure that this is so. (See the intuition.h include file for full details on using PlanePick). BUGS SEE ALSO DrawImageState() , EraseImage() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
