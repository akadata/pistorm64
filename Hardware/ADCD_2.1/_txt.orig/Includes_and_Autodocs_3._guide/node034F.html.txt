icon.library/GetIconRectangleA ]" border=0> NAME GetIconRectangleA -- Query the size of the area an icon renders into (V44) SYNOPSIS success = GetIconRectangleA(rp,icon,label,rectangle,tags) D0 A0 A1 A2 A3 A4 BOOL GetIconRectangleA(struct RastPort *rp,struct DiskObject *icon, STRPTR label,struct Rectangle *rectangle, struct TagItem *tags); success = GetIconRectangle(rp,icon,label,rectangle,...); BOOL GetIconRectangle(struct RastPort *rp,struct DiskObject *icon, STRPTR label,struct Rectangle *rectangle,...); FUNCTION This function will calculate the size of the area icon rendering would affect. INPUTS rp -- Pointer to the RastPort to use for calculating the the size of the label with respect to the font and style options currently in use; this parameter may be NULL if the label is NULL, too. icon -- Pointer to a struct DiskObject . label -- Pointer to a NUL-terminated string, or NULL if no label text is to enter the calculation. rectangle -- Pointer to a struct Rectangle to fill in. The contents will take the size of the icon image, the icon border size and -- if you provide RastPort and label text -- the icon label into account. Due to how labels are printed, the rectangle->MinX and rectangle->MinY members may be negative. tags -- Additional drawing options to be taken into account. TAGS ICONDRAWA_DrawInfo (struct DrawInfo *) -- Drawing information data associated with the RastPort parameter passed in. This tag defaults to NULL. ICONDRAWA_Borderless (BOOL) -- When calculating the size of the rectangle, this tag allows you to leave the icon border size out of the equation. This tag defaults to FALSE. RESULTS success -- TRUE if the parameters were well-formed and the output data fits into the Rectangle data structure (which may not be the case if the image is too large for a signed 16 bit integer to hold). EXAMPLE /* Find out how large an icon is. */ struct DiskObject *icon; struct Rectangle rect; if(GetIconRectangleA(NULL,NULL,icon,NULL,&rect,NULL)) { LONG width,height; width = rect.MaxX - rect.MinX + 1; height = rect.MaxY - rect.MinY + 1; Printf("icon is %ld×%ld pixels in size.n", width,height); } /* Find out which area the icon rendering would * cover if a label would be printed below it. */ struct RastPort *rp; if(GetIconRectangle(rp,NULL,icon,"a rather long label text",&rect,TAG_DONE)) { Printf("icon plus label would cover the area %ld,%ld×%ld,%ldn", rect.MinX,rect.MinY,rect.MaxX,rect.MaxY); } NOTES This function can be used to optimize on-screen rendering by precalculating the area rendering would cover. To make sure that the precalculated area size matches the one covered by the actual drawing operation, the RastPorts you use for measuring and for drawing should share the same font and the same text styles. The image size calculated by this function can be slightly larger than the data you will find in the icon's do_Gadget.GadgetRender Image structure since the icon border will be taken into account. This happens regardless of whether icon.library was switched into frameless icon rendering mode or whether the icon is frameless. To obtain the size of the icon without taking the border into account, use the ICONDRAWA_Borderless tag.
