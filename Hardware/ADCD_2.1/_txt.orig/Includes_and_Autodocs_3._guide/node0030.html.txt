(V36) SYNOPSIS senderObj = CxSender(port,id) CxObj *CxSender(struct MsgPort *,LONG); FUNCTION This function creates a Commodities sender object. The action of this object on receiving a Commodities message is to copy the Commodities message into a standard Exec Message , to put the value 'id' in the message as well, and to send the message off to the message port 'port'. The value 'id' is used so that an application can monitor messages from several senders at a single port. It can be retrieved from the Exec message by using the function CxMsgID() . The value can be a simple integer ID, or a pointer to some application data structure. Note that Exec messages sent by sender objects arrive asynchronously at the destination port. Do not assume anything about the status of the Commodities message which was copied into the Exec message you received. All Exec messages sent to your ports must be replied. Messages may be replied after the sender object has been deleted. This function is a C-language macro for CreateCxObj() , defined in . INPUTS port - the port for the sender to send messages to id - the id of the messages sent by the sender RESULTS senderObj - a pointer to the sender object, or NULL if it could not be created.
