amiga.lib/printf ]" border=0> NAME printf - print a formatted output line to the standard output. SYNOPSIS printf(formatstring [,value [,values] ] ); FUNCTION Format the output in accordance with specifications in the format string. INPUTS formatString - a C-language-like NULL-terminated format string, with the following supported % options: %[flags][width][.limit][length]type $ - must follow the arg_pos value, if specified flags - only one allowed. '-' specifies left justification. width - field width. If the first character is a '0', the field is padded with leading 0s. . - must precede the field width value, if specified limit - maximum number of characters to output from a string. (only valid for %s or %b). length - size of input data defaults to word (16-bit) for types c, d, u and x, 'l' changes this to long (32-bit). type - supported types are: b - BSTR, data is 32-bit BPTR to byte count followed by a byte string. A NULL BPTR is treated as an empty string. (V36) d - signed decimal u - unsigned decimal x - hexadecimal with hex digits in uppercase X - hexadecimal with hex digits in lowercase s - string, a 32-bit pointer to a NULL-terminated byte string. A NULL pointer is treated as an empty string. c - character value(s) - numeric variables or addresses of null-terminated strings to be added to the format information. NOTE The global "_stdout" must be defined, and contain a pointer to a legal AmigaDOS file handle. Using the standard Amiga startup module sets this up. In other cases you will need to define stdout, and assign it to some reasonable value (like what the dos.library/Output() call returns). This code would set it up: ULONG stdout; stdout=Output(); BUGS This function will crash if the resulting stream after parameter substitution is longer than 140 bytes. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
