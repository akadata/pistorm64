SYNOPSIS result = DoMethod( obj, MethodID, ... ) ULONG DoMethod( Object *, ULONG, ... ); FUNCTION Boopsi support function that invokes the supplied message on the specified object. The message is invoked on the object's true class. Equivalent to DoMethodA() , but allows you to build the message on the stack. INPUTS obj - pointer to boopsi object MethodID - which method to send (see ) ... - method-specific message built on the stack RESULT result - specific to the message and the object's class.
