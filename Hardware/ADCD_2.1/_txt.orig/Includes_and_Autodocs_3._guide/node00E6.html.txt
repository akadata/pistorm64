(V36) SYNOPSIS data = CxMsgData(cxm); D0 A0 APTR CxMsgData(struct CxMsg *); FUNCTION Most commodity messages contain meaningful data such as an InputEvent structure. This function returns a pointer to this data. You may get a commodity message from a synchronous (custom object) or asynchronous (sender object) source. In the second case, 'data' is not valid after you have replied to the message. INPUTS cxm - the commodity message to get the data pointer from (may be NULL) RESULTS data - a pointer to the message's data, or NULL if 'cxm' is NULL. The meaning of the data varies depending on which kind of object is being inspected. BUGS Until V38, passing a NULL 'cxm' parameter would cause low-memory access and unpredictable results. Until V40, whenever the data pointer is a (struct InputEvent), the ie_EventAddress field of these structures was not reliable whenever the message was generated by a sender object.
