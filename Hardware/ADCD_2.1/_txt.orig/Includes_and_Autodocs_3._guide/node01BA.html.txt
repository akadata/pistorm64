dos.library/SetOwner ]" border=0> NAME SetOwner -- Set owner information for a file or directory (V39) SYNOPSIS success = SetOwner( name, owner_info ) D0 D1 D2 BOOL SetOwner (STRPTR, LONG) FUNCTION SetOwner() sets the owner information for the file or directory. This value is a 32-bit value that is normally split into 16 bits of owner user id (bits 31-16), and 16 bits of owner group id (bits 15-0). However, other than returning them as shown by Examine()/ ExNext()/ExAll() , the filesystem take no interest in the values. These are primarily for use by networking software (clients and hosts), in conjunction with the FIBF_OTR_xxx and FIBF_GRP_xxx protection bits. This entrypoint did not exist in V36, so you must open at least V37 dos.library to use it. V37 dos.library will return FALSE to this call. INPUTS name - pointer to a null-terminated string owner_info - owner uid (31:16) and group id (15:0) RESULTS success - boolean SEE ALSO SetProtect(), Examine() , ExNext() , ExAll() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
