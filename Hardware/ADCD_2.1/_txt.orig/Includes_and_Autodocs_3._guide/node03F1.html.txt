(V36) SYNOPSIS result = SetGadgetAttrsA( Gadget , Window , Requester , TagList ) D0 A0 A1 A2 A3 ULONG SetGadgetAttrsA( struct Gadget *, struct Window *, struct Requester *, struct TagItem * ); result = SetGadgetAttrs( Gadget , Window , Requester , Tag1, ...) ULONG SetGadgetAttrs( struct Gadget *, struct Window *, struct Requester *, ULONG, ... ); FUNCTION Same as SetAttrs(), but provides context information and arbitration for classes which implement custom Intuition gadgets. You should use this function for boopsi gadget objects which have already been added to a requester or a window, or for "models" which propagate information to gadget already added. Typically, the gadgets will refresh their visuals to reflect changes to visible attributes, such as the value of a slider, the text in a string-type gadget, the selected state of a button. You can use this as a replacement for SetAttrs(), too, if you specify NULL for the 'Window' and 'Requester' parameters. INPUTS Gadget = abstract pointer to a boopsi gadget Window = window gadget has been added to using AddGList() or AddGadget() Requester = for REQGADGETs, requester containing the gadget TagList = array of TagItem structures with attribute/value pairs. RESULT The object does whatever it wants with the attributes you provide, which might include updating its gadget visuals. The return value tends to be non-zero if the changes would require refreshing gadget imagery, if the object is a gadget. NOTES This function invokes the OM_SET method with a GadgetInfo derived from the 'Window' and 'Requester' pointers. BUGS Prior to V39, this function ran with inadequate locking against the calls that Intuition's input task makes to the gadgets. To run properly prior to V39, this function, input processing, and and the gadget's dispatcher must be mutually re-entrant.
