dos.library/MakeLink ]" border=0> NAME MakeLink -- Creates a filesystem link (V36) SYNOPSIS success = MakeLink( name, dest, soft ) D0 D1 D2 D3 BOOL MakeLink( STRPTR , LONG , LONG ) FUNCTION Create a filesystem link from 'name' to dest. For "soft-links", dest is a pointer to a null-terminated path string. For "hard- links", dest is a lock (BPTR). 'soft' is FALSE for hard-links, non-zero otherwise. Soft-links are resolved at access time by a combination of the filesystem (by returning ERROR_IS_SOFT_LINK to dos), and by Dos (using ReadLink() to resolve any links that are hit). Hard-links are resolved by the filesystem in question. A series of hard-links to a file are all equivalent to the file itself. If one of the links (or the original entry for the file) is deleted, the data remains until there are no links left. INPUTS name - Name of the link to create dest - CPTR to path string, or BPTR lock soft - FALSE for hard-links, non-zero for soft-links RESULT Success - boolean BUGS In V36, soft-links didn't work in the ROM filesystem. This was fixed for V37. SEE ALSO ReadLink() , Open() , Lock() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
