SYNOPSIS Success = GetScreenData( Buffer, Size, Type, Screen ) D0 A0 D0 D1 A1 BOOL GetScreenData( APTR , UWORD , UWORD , struct Screen * ); FUNCTION This function copies into the caller's buffer data from a Screen structure. Typically, this call will be used to find the size, title bar height, and other values for a standard screen, such as the Workbench screen. To get the data for the Workbench screen, one would call: GetScreenData(buff, sizeof(struct Screen), WBENCHSCREEN, NULL) NOTE: if the requested standard screen is not open, this function will have the effect of opening it. This function has been useful for two basic types of things: 1) Determining information about the Workbench screen, in preparation for opening a window on it. 2) Attempts at discerning the user's preferences in a working screen, for "cloning" the Workbench modes and dimensions when opening a similar custom screen. Providing compatibility with both of these goals has proven difficult, as we introduce new display modes and screen scrolling in V36. Read carefully the somewhat involved exceptions we elected to implement ... Changes as of V36: For V36 and later, the function LockPubScreen() is an improvement over this function, in that it doesn't copy the screen data but returns a pointer and a guarantee that the screen will not be closed. If the global public screen SHANGHAI mode is in effect (see SetPubScreenModes() ), this function will actually report on the default public screen, where "Workbench" windows will actually open. For V36 and later, this function does some "compatibility tricks" when you inquire about the WBENCHSCREEN. To keep programs from "stumbling" into modes they don't understand, and because an NTSC machine may be running a PAL Workbench or PRODUCTIVITY, for example, the following "false" information is returned. The Screen.ViewPort.Modes field will either be HIRES or HIRES+LACE (with the SPRITES flag also set, as usual). HIRES+LACE is used if the display mode selected for the Workbench screen is an interlaced screen of any type. The dimensions returned will be the *smaller* of the OSCAN_TEXT dimensions for the returned mode, and the actual dimensions of the Workbench screen. EXCEPTION: For specific compatibility considerations, if the Workbench is in one of the A2024 modes, the mode returned in Screen.ViewPort.Modes will be HIRES+LACE (with perhaps some "special" bits also set for future improvement), but with dimensions equal to the actual A2024-mode Workbench screen. This will favor programs which open windows on the A2024 Workbench, but will cause some problems for programs which try to "clone" the Workbench screen using this function. If you want the real information about the modern Workbench screen, call LockPubScreen( "Workbench" ) and acquire its display mode ID by inquiring of the actual ViewPort (using graphics.library/GetVPModeID() ). You may then use the information you get to clone as many of the properties of the Workbench screen that you wish. In the long run, it's probably better to provide your user with a screen mode selection option, and skip all this. INPUTS Buffer = pointer to a buffer into which data can be copied Size = the size of the buffer provided, in bytes Type = the screen type, as specified in OpenWindow() (WBENCHSCREEN, CUSTOMSCREEN, ...) Screen = ignored, unless type is CUSTOMSCREEN, which results only in copying 'size' bytes from 'screen' to 'buffer' RESULT TRUE if successful FALSE if standard screen of Type 'type' could not be opened. BUGS You cannot support the new V36 display modes using this function.
