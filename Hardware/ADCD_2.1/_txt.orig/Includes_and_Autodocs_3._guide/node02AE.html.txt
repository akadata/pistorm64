(V39) SYNOPSIS status=AttachPalExtra( cm, vp) a0 a1 LONG AttachPalExtra( Struct ColorMap *, struct ViewPort *); FUNCTION Allocates and attaches a PalExtra structure to a ColorMap . This is necessary for color palette sharing to work. The PalExtra structure will be freed by FreeColorMap() . The set of available colors will be determined by the mode and depth of the viewport. INPUTS cm = A pointer to a color map created by GetColorMap() . vp = A pointer to the viewport structure associated with the ColorMap . RESULTS status - 0 if sucessful, else an error number. The only currently defined error number is out of memory (1). BUGS NOTES This function is for use with custom ViewPorts and custom ColorMaps, as Intuition attaches a PalExtra to all of its Screens. If there is already a PalExtra associated with the ColorMap , then this function will do nothing. SEE ALSO GetColorMap() FreeColorMap() ObtainPen() ObtainBestPenA() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
