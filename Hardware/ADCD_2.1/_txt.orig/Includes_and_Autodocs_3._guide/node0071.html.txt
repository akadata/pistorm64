audio.device/CMD_WRITE ]" border=0> NAME CMD_WRITE -- normal I/O entry point FUNCTION CMD_WRITE is a standard command for a single audio channel (io_Unit). If the allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) is correct, CMD_WRITE plays a sound using the selected channel; otherwise, it returns an error (ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION). CMD_WRITE queues up requests if there is another write in progress or if the channel is stopped (CMD_STOP). When the write actually starts; if the ADIOF_PERVOL flag is set, CMD_WRITE loads volume (ioa_Volume) and period (ioa_Period), and if the ADIOF_WRITEMESSAGE flag is set, CMD_WRITE replies the write message (ioa_WriteMsg). CMD_WRITE returns an error (IOERR_ABORTED) if it is canceled (AbortIO) or the channel is stolen (ADCMD_ALLOCATE). CMD_WRITE is only asynchronous if there is no error, in which case it clears the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) and replies the I/O request (mn_ReplyPort) after it finishes writting; otherwise, it is synchronous and only replies if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear. Do not use CMD_WRITE in interrupt code at interrupt level 5 or higher. INPUTS mn_ReplyPort- pointer to message port that receives I/O request after the write completes io_Device - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function io_Unit - bit map of channel to write (bit 0 thru 3 corresponds to channel 0 thru 3), if more then one bit is set lowest bit number channel is written io_Command - command number for CMD_WRITE io_Flags - flags, must be cleared if not used: ADIOF_PERVOL - (SET) load volume and period ADIOF_WRITEMESSAGE - (SET) reply message at write start ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function or ADCMD_ALLOCATE command ioa_Data - pointer to waveform array (signed bytes (-128 thru 127) in custom chip addressable ram and word aligned) ioa_Length - length of the wave array in bytes (2 thru 131072, must be even number) ioa_Period - sample period in 279.365 ns increments (124 thru 65536, anti-aliasing filter works below 300 to 500 depending on waveform), if enabled by ADIOF_PERVOL ioa_Volume - volume (0 thru 64, linear), if enabled by ADIOF_PERVOL ioa_Cycles - number of times to repeat array (0 thru 65535, 0 for infinite) ioa_WriteMsg- message replied at start of write, if enabled by ADIOF_WRITEMESSAGE OUTPUTS io_Unit - bit map of channel successfully written (bit 0 thru 3 corresponds to channel 0 thru 3) io_Flags - IOF_QUICK flag cleared if there is no error io_Error - error number: 0 - no error IOERR_ABORTED - canceled (AbortIO) or channel stolen ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION - allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) does not match key for channel BUGS If CMD_WRITE starts the write immediately after stopping a previous write, you must set the ADIOF_PERVOL flag or else the new data pointer (ioa_Data) and length (ioa_Length) may not be loaded.
