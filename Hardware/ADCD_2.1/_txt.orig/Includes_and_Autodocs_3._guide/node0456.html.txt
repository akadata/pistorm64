(V38) SYNOPSIS FormatDate(locale,fmtTemplate,date,putCharFunc); A0 A1 A2 A3 VOID FormatDate(struct Locale *, STRPTR ,struct DateStamp *, struct Hook *); FUNCTION This function processes a formatting template and generates a stream of bytes that's sent one character at a time to the putCharFunc callback hook. INPUTS locale - the locale to use for the formatting fmtTemplate - the NULL-terminated template describing the desired format for the date. This is constructed just like C-language printf() statements, except that different formatting codes are used. Just like in C, formatting codes start with a % followed by the formatting command. The following commands are accepted by this function: %a - abbreviated weekday name %A - weekday name %b - abbreviated month name %B - month name %c - same as "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y" %C - same as "%a %b %e %T %Z %Y" %d - day number with leading 0s %D - same as "%m/%d/%y" %e - day number with leading spaces %h - abbreviated month name %H - hour using 24-hour style with leading 0s %I - hour using 12-hour style with leading 0s %j - julian date %m - month number with leading 0s %M - the number of minutes with leading 0s %n - insert a linefeed %p - AM or PM strings %q - hour using 24-hour style %Q - hour using 12-hour style %r - same as "%I:%M:%S %p" %R - same as "%H:%M" %S - number of seconds with leadings 0s %t - insert a tab character %T - same as "%H:%M:%S" %U - week number, taking Sunday as first day of week %w - weekday number %W - week number, taking Monday as first day of week %x - same as "%m/%d/%y" %X - same as "%H:%M:%S" %y - year using two digits with leading 0s %Y - year using four digits with leading 0s If the template parameter is NULL, a single NULL byte is sent to putCharFunc. date - the date to format into a string putCharFunc - a callback hook invoked for every character generated, including for the terminating NULL character. The hook is called with: A0 - address of Hook structure A1 - character for hook to process (not a pointer!) A2 - locale pointer SEE ALSO ParseDate() , , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
