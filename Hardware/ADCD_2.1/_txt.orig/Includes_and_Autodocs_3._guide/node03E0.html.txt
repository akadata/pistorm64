intuition.library/RemakeDisplay ]" border=0> NAME RemakeDisplay -- Remake the entire Intuition display. SYNOPSIS failure = RemakeDisplay() D0 (V39) LONG RemakeDisplay( VOID ); /* Returns LONG in V39 and greater */ FUNCTION This is the big one. This procedure remakes the entire View structure for the Intuition display. It does the equivalent of MakeScreen() for every screen in the system, and then it calls the internal equivalent of RethinkDisplay() . WARNING: This routine can take many milliseconds to run, so do not use it lightly. Calling MakeScreen() followed by RethinkDisplay() is typically a more efficient method for affecting changes to a single screen's ViewPort . INPUTS None RESULT Starting with V39, returns zero for success, non-zero for failure. Probable cause of failure is failure of graphics.library/MakeVPort() or of graphics.library/MrgCop() . Prior to V39, the return code is invalid. Do not interpret it when running on pre-V39 systems!
