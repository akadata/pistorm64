(V40.27) SYNOPSIS success = SetJoyPortAttrsA(portNumber, tagList); D0 D0 A1 BOOL SetJoyPortAttrsA(ULONG, struct TagItem *); Success = SetJoyPortAttrs(portNumber, firstTag, ...); BOOL SetJoyPortAttrs(Tag, ...); FUNCTION This function allows modification of several attributes held by ReadJoyPort() about both it's operation and the type of controller currently plugged into the port. ReadJoyPort()'s default behavior is to attempt to automatically sense the type of controller plugged into any given port, when asked to read that port. This behavior is beneficial, to allow simple detection of the type of controller plugged into the port. Unfortunately, rare cases are possible where extremely fine mouse movements appear to be real joystick movements. Also, this ability to auto-sense the controller type causes most reads to take longer than if there were no auto-sensing. SetJoyPortAttrs() is intended to provide for both of these cases. It allows the programmer to notify ReadJoyPort() to stop spending time attempting to sense which type of controller is in use -- and, optionally, to force ReadJoyPort() into utilizing a certain controller type. INPUTS portNumber - the joyport in question (0-3). tagList - a pointer to an array of tags providing parameters to SetJoyPortAttrs(); if NULL, the function will return TRUE, but do nothing. TAGS SJA_Type (ULONG) - Sets the current controller type to the mouse, joystick, or game controller. Supply one of SJA_TYPE_GAMECTLR, SJA_TYPE_MOUSE, SJA_TYPE_JOYSTK, or SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE. If SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE is used, ReadJoyPort() will attempt to determine the type of controller plugged into the given port automatically. If one of the other types is used, ReadJoyPort() will make no attempt to read the given controller as anything other than the type specified. The default type is SJA_AUTOSENSE. Note -- if you set the type to anything other than auto-sense, it's your responsibility to return it to auto-sense mode before exiting. SJA_Reinitialize (VOID) - Return a given port to it's initial state, forcing a port to deallocate any allocated resources; return the implied type to SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE. RESULT success - TRUE if everything went according to plan, or FALSE upon failure SEE ALSO ReadJoyPort() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
