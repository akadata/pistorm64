SYNOPSIS Success = Request( Requester , Window ) D0 A0 A1 BOOL Request( struct Requester *, struct Window * ); FUNCTION Links in and displays a requester into the specified window. This routine ignores the window's IDCMP_REQVERIFY flag. INPUTS Requester = pointer to the requester to be displayed Window = pointer to the window into which this requester goes New for V36: the POINTREL flag now has meaning if the requester is not a DMR (Double-Menu Requester): If POINTREL is set this requester should be placed in the center of the window, offset by Requester.RelLeft and Requester.RelTop. If the requester doesn't fit in the window, its position will be adjusted to show the upper-left corner. RESULT If the requester is successfully opened, TRUE is returned. Otherwise, if the requester could not be opened, FALSE is returned. BUGS It turns out that the return code of this function is not always correct under V34 and prior. If your requester does not have an ENDGADGET, then you can examine window->FirstRequest to see if your requester successfully opened. (A requester with an ENDGADGET can go away all by itself before you get the chance to look). Under V36 and higher, the return code from this routine is fine. There is a maximum of 8 requesters that are supported in a window that can be changed in size, position, or depth.
