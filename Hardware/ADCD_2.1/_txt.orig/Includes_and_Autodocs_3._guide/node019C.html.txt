Also indicates if there are any wildcards in the pattern (i.e. whether it might match more than one item). Note that Dest must be at least 2 times as large as Source plus 2 bytes. For a description of the wildcards, see ParsePattern() . INPUTS source - unparsed wildcard string to search for. dest - output string, gets tokenized version of input. DestLength - length available in destination (should be at least as twice as large as source + 2 bytes). RESULT IsWild - 1 means there were wildcards in the pattern, 0 means there were no wildcards in the pattern, -1 means there was a buffer overflow or other error BUGS In V37 this call didn't always set IoErr() to something useful on an error. Fixed in V39. In V37, it didn't properly convert character-classes ([x-y]) to upper case. Workaround: convert the input pattern to upper case using ToUpper() from utility.library before calling ParsePatternNoCase(). Fixed in V39 dos.
