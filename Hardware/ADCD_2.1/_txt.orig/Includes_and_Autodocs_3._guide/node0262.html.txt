If the oldConfigDev is NULL the the search is from the start of the list of configuration devices. If it is not null then it searches from the first configuration device entry AFTER oldConfigDev. A code of -1 is treated as a wildcard -- e.g. it matches any manufacturer (or product) INPUTS oldConfigDev - a valid ConfigDev structure, or NULL to start from the start of the list. manufacturer - the manufacturer code being searched for, or -1 to ignore manufacturer numbers. product - the product code being searched for, or -1 to ignore product numbers. RESULTS configDev - the next ConfigDev entry that matches the manufacturer and product codes, or NULL if there are no more matches. EXCEPTIONS EXAMPLES /* to find all configdevs of the proper type */ struct ConfigDev *cd = NULL; while( cd = FindConfigDev( cd, MANUFACTURER, PRODUCT ) ) { /* do something with the returned ConfigDev */ } SEE ALSO BUGS [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
