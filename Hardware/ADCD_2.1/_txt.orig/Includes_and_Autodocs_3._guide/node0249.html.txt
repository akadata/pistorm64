SAD/--Overview-- ]" border=0> Simple Amiga Debugging Kernel, known as "SAD" It is in EXEC starting in V39 -- General description -- The Simple Amiga Debugging Kernel (SAD) is a set of very simple control routines stored in the Kickstart ROM that would let debuggers control the Amiga's development enviroment from the outside. These tools would make it possible to do remote machine development/debugging via just the on-board serial port. This set of control routines is very simple and yet completely flexible, thus making it possible to control the whole machine. -- Technical Issues -- SAD will make use of the motherboard serial port that exists in all Amiga systems. The connection via the serial port lets the system be able to execute SAD without needing any of the system software up and running. (SAD will play with the serial port directly) With some minor changes to the Amiga hardware, an NMI-like line could be hooked up to a pin on the serial port. This would let external control of the machine and would let the external controller stop the machine no matter what state it is in. (NMI is that way) In order to function correctly, SAD requires the some of the EXEC CPU control functions work and that ExecBase be valid. Beyond that, SAD does not require the OS to be running. -- Command Overview -- The basic commands needed to operate SAD are as follows: Read and Write memory as byte, word, and longword. Get the register frame address (contains all registers) JSR to Address Return to system operation (return from interrupt) These basic routines will let the system do whatever is needed. Since the JSR to address and memory read/write routines can be used to download small sections of code that could be used to do more complex things, this basic command set is thus flexible enough to even replace itself. Caches will automatically be flushed as needed after each write. (A call to CacheClearU() will be made after the write and before the command done sequence) -- Technical Command Descriptions -- Since the communications with SAD is via a serial port, data formats have been defined for minimum overhead while still giving reasonable data reliability. SAD will use the serial port at default 9600 baud but the external tools can change the serial port's data rate if it wishes. It would need to make sure that it will be able to reconnect. SAD sets the baud rate to 9600 each time it is entered. However, while within SAD, a simple command to write a WORD to the SERPER register would change the baud rate. This will remain in effect until you exit and re-enter SAD or until you change the register again. (This can be usefull if you need to transfer a large amount of data) All commands have a basic format that they will follow. All commands have both an ACK and a completion message. Basic command format is: SENDER: $AF [ ] Receive: Command ACK: $00 Command Done: $1F [ ] Waiting: $53 $41 $44 $BF Waiting when called from Debug(): $53 $41 $44 $3F Waiting when in dead-end crash: $53 $41 $44 $21 The data sequence will be that SAD will emit a $BF and then wait for a command. If no command is received within seconds, it will emit $BF again and loop back. (This is the "heart beat" of SAD) When called from Debug() and not the NMI hook, SAD will use $3F as the "heart beat" If SAD does not get a responce after heartbeats, it will return to the system. (Execute an RTS or RTE as needed) This is to prevent a full hang. The debugger at the other end can keep SAD happy by sending a NO-OP command. All I/O in SAD times out. During the transmition of a command, if more than 2 seconds pass between bytes of data SAD will time out and return to the prompt. This is mainly to help make sure that SAD can never get into an i-loop situation. -- Data Structure Issues -- While executing in SAD, you may have full access to machine from the CPU standpoint. However, this could also be a problem. It is important to understand that when entered via NMI that many system lists may be in unstable state. (NMI can happen in the middle of the AllocMem routine or task switch, etc) Also, since you are doing debugging, it is up to you to determin what operations can be done and what can not be done. A good example is that if you want to write a WORD or LONG that the address will need to be even on 68000 processors. Also, if you read or write memory that does not exist, you may get a bus error. Following system structures may require that you check the pointers at each step. When entered via Debug() , you are now running as a "task" so you will be able to assume some things about system structures. This means that you are in supervisor state and that you can assume that the system is at least not between states. However, remember that since you are debugging the system, some bad code could cause data structures to be invalid. Again, standard debugging issues are in play. SAD just gives you the hooks to do whatever you need. Note: When SAD prompts with $BF you will be in full disable/forbid state. When $3F prompting, SAD will only do a Forbid() . It is possible for you to then disable interrupts as needed. This is done such that it is possible to "run" the system from SAD when called with Debug() . -- Data Frames and the Registers -- SAD generates a special data frame that can be used to read what registers contain and to change the contents of the registers. See the entry for GET_CONTEXT_FRAME for more details ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- - BUGS In V39 EXEC, the WRITE_BYTE command was not connected and this caused all of the command numbers to be off-by-one. For example, the READ_WORD command is listed as command $05 but in V39 is $04. However, the ACK of the commands are still correct. Also, in V39 EXEC, the READ_WORD command would return the wrong data. To determin if you are in V39 or V40 SAD, you can issue a simple SAD command at the start of the session. By sending a READ_WORD command, you may either get a READ_WORD (V40) or a READ_LONG (V39) ACK'ed back. So the data stream for a safe test would be: Send: $AF $05 $00 $F8 $00 $00 ; Read start of ROM... Recv: $00 $05 .... You have V40 SAD Recv: $00 $06 .... You have V39 SAD Note that you should be ready to read either 2 or 4 bytes of result depending on the ACK sent by the system. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
