SUPERCLASS gadgetclass REQUIRES bevel.image, glyph.image DESCRIPTION A chooser is a small-list selection object. In its inactive mode it looks much like a button or cycle gadget. When the button is pressed using the mouse, a menu displaying the items in the list is displayed. The chooser operates in either of two modes, pop-up and drop-down. Even though the may operate similarly internally, they are for two different functions. Consult the chooser style guide for information on how to use these two modes. Advantages that this class provides: > Supports window relativity. > Supports OS 3.0 BOOPSI Gadget HelpTest. > Cycle2Menu style activation. > Supports tab-cycle activation and keyboard control.
