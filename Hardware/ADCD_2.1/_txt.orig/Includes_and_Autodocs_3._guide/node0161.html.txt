dos.library/Fault ]" border=0> NAME Fault -- Returns the text associated with a DOS error code (V36) SYNOPSIS len = Fault(code, header, buffer, len) D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 LONG Fault(LONG, STRPTR , STRPTR , LONG) FUNCTION This routine obtains the error message text for the given error code. The header is prepended to the text of the error message, followed by a colon. Puts a null-terminated string for the error message into the buffer. By convention, error messages should be no longer than 80 characters (+1 for termination), and preferably no more than 60. The value returned by IoErr() is set to the code passed in. If there is no message for the error code, the message will be "Error code n". The number of characters put into the buffer is returned, which will be 0 if the code passed in was 0. INPUTS code - Error code header - header to output before error text buffer - Buffer to receive error message. len - Length of the buffer. RESULT len - number of characters put into buffer (may be 0) SEE ALSO IoErr() , SetIoErr() , PrintFault() BUGS In older documentation, the return was shown as BOOL success. This was incorrect, it has always returned the length. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
