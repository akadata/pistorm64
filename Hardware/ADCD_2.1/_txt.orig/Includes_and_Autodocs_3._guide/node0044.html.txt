In fact, if you are running in V39, this function will notice and call the EXEC function. This function works in V33 and up (1.2) Amiga system. The C code interface is _LibCreatePool() and takes its arguments from the stack just like the C code interface for CreatePool() in amiga.lib. The assembly code interface is with the symbol _AsmCreatePool: and takes the parameters in registers with the additional parameter of ExecBase being in a6 which can be used from SAS/C 6 by a prototype of: void * __asm AsmCreatePool(register __d0 ULONG, register __d1 ULONG, register __d2 ULONG, register __a6 struct ExecBase *); Allocate and prepare a new memory pool header. Each pool is a separate tracking system for memory of a specific type. Any number of pools may exist in the system. Pools automatically expand and shrink based on demand. Fixed sized "puddles" are allocated by the pool manager when more total memory is needed. Many small allocations can fit in a single puddle. Allocations larger than the threshSize are allocation in their own puddles. At any time individual allocations may be freed. Or, the entire pool may be removed in a single step. INPUTS memFlags - a memory flags specifier, as taken by AllocMem . puddleSize - the size of Puddles... threshSize - the largest allocation that goes into normal puddles This *MUST* be less than or equal to puddleSize (LibCreatePool() will fail if it is not) RESULT The address of a new pool header, or NULL for error.
