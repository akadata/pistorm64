audio.device/CMD_START ]" border=0> NAME CMD_START -- start device processing (like ^Q) FUNCTION CMD_START is a standard command for multiple audio channels. For each selected channel (io_Unit), if the allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) is correct and the channel was previously stopped (CMD_STOP), CMP_START immediately starts all writes (CMD_WRITE) to the channel. If the allocation key is incorrect, CMD_START returns an error (ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION). CMD_START starts multiple channels simultaneously to minimize distortion if the channels are playing the same waveform and their outputs are mixed. CMD_START is synchronous an d only replies (mn_ReplyPort) if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear. D o not use CMD_START in interrupt code at interrupt level 5 or higher. INPUTS mn_ReplyPort- pointer to message port that receives I/O request after if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear io_Device - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function io_Unit - bit map of channels to start (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Command - command number for CMD_START io_Flags - flags, must be cleared if not used: IOF_QUICK - (CLEAR) reply I/O request ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function or ADCMD_ALLOCATE command OUTPUTS io_Unit - bit map of channels successfully started (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Error - error number: 0 - no error ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION - allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) does not match key for channel [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
