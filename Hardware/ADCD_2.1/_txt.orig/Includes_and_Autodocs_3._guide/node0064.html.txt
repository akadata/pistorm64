audio.device/ADCMD_LOCK ]" border=0> NAME ADCMD_LOCK -- prevent audio channels from being stolen FUNCTION ADCMD_LOCK is a command for multiple audio channels. For each selected channel (io_Unit), if the allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) is correct, ADCMD_LOCK locks the channel, preventing subsequent allocations (ADCMD_ALLOCATE or OpenDevice) from stealing the channel. Otherwise, ADCMD_LOCK returns an error (ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION) and will not lock any channels. Unlike setting the precedence (ADCMD_SETPREC, ADCMD_ALLOCATE or OpenDevice) to maximum (ADALLOC_MAXPREC) which would cause all subsequent allocations to fail, ADCMD_LOCK causes all higher precedence allocations, even no-wait (ADIOF_NOWAIT) allocations, to wait until the channels are un-locked. Locked channels can only be unlocked by freeing them (ADCMD_FREE), which clears the channel select bits (io_Unit). ADCMD_LOCK does not reply the I/O request (mn_ReplyPort) until all the channels it locks are freed, unless a higher precedence allocation attempts to steal one the locked channels. If a steal occurs, ADCMD_LOCK replies and returns an error (ADIOERR_CHANNELSTOLEN). If the lock is replied (mn_ReplyPort) with this error, the channels should be freed as soon as possible. To avoid a possible deadlock, never make the freeing of stolen channels dependent on another allocations completion. ADCMD_LOCK is only asynchronous if the allocation key is correct, in which case it clears the quick flag (IOF_QUICK); otherwise, it is synchronous and only replies if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear. Do not use ADCMD_LOCK in interrupt code. INPUTS mn_ReplyPort- pointer to message port that receives I/O request if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear io_Device - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function io_Unit - bit map of channels to lock (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Command - command number for ADCMD_LOCK io_Flags - flags, must be cleared ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function or ADCMD_ALLOCATE command OUTPUTS io_Unit - bit map of successfully locked channels (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) not freed (ADCMD_FREE) io_Flags - IOF_QUICK flag cleared if the allocation key is correct (no ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION error) io_Error - error number: 0 - no error ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION - allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) does not match key for channel ADIOERR_CHANNELSTOLEN- allocation attempting to steal locked channel [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
