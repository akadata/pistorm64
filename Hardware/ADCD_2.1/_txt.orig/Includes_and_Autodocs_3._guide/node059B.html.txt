(V36) SYNOPSIS clone = CloneTagItems(original); D0 A0 struct TagItem *CloneTagItems(struct TagItem *); FUNCTION Copies the essential contents of a tag list into a new tag list. The cloning is such that calling FindTagItem() with a given tag on the original or cloned tag lists will always return the same tag value. That is, the ordering of the tags is maintained. INPUTS original - tag list to clone. May be NULL, in which case an empty tag list is returned. RESULTS clone - copy of the original tag list, or NULL if there was not enough memory. This tag list must eventually by freed by calling FreeTagItems() . SEE ALSO , AllocateTagItems() , FreeTagItems() , RefreshTagItemClones() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
