This function may also return 0 if no vectors are available. Your hardware should be able to then fall back to using the shared interrupt server chain should this happen. The interrupt code is a direct connect to the physical interrupt. This means that it is the responsibility of your code to do all of the context saving/restoring required by interrupt code. Also, due to the performance of the interrupt controller, you may need to also watch for "false" interrupts. These are interrupts that come in just after a DISABLE. The reason this happens is because the interrupt may have been posted before the DISABLE hardware access is completed. For example: myInt: move.l d0,-(sp) ; Save d0... move.w _intenar,d0 ; Get interrupt enable state btst.l #INTB_INTEN,d0 ; Check if pending disable bne.s realInt ; If not, do real one... exitInt: move.l (sp)+,d0 ; Restore d0 rte ; Return from int... ; realInt: ; Now do your int code... d0 is already saved ; ALL other registers need to be saved if needed ; This includes a0/a1/d0/d1 as this is an interrupt ; and not a function call... ; bra.s exitInt ; Exit interrupt... If your interrupt will not play with system (OS) structures and your own structures are safe to play with you do not need to check for the disable. It is only needed for when the system is in disable but that "one last interrupt" still got through. NOTE This function was not implemented fully until V39. Due to a mis-cue it is not safe to call in V37 EXEC. (Sorry) INPUTS A pointer to your interrupt code. This code is not an EXEC interrupt but is dirrectly connected to the hardware interrupt. Thus, the interrupt code must not modify any registers and must return via an RTE. RESULTS The 8-bit vector number used for Zorro-III Quick Interrupts If it returns 0, no quick interrupt was allocatable. The device should at this point switch to using the shared interrupt server method. SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
