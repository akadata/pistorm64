External applications may also call this requester. In addition, if someone were to wish to replace this requester with another one, they could do so via a SetFunction . INPUTS lock - A lock on the parent directory name - The name of the icon contained within above directory screen - A screen pointer on which the requester is to show up RESULTS worked - Returns TRUE if the requester came up, FALSE if it did not. NOTE Note that this LVO may be called many times by different tasks before other calls return. Thus, the code must be 100% re-entrant. SEE ALSO icon.library [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
