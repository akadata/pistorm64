utility.library/CallHookPkt ]" border=0> NAME CallHookPkt -- invoke a Hook function callback. (V36) SYNOPSIS return = CallHookPkt(hook,object,message); D0 A0 A2 A1 ULONG CallHookPkt(struct Hook *, APTR ,APTR); FUNCTION Performs the callback standard defined by a Hook structure. This function is really very simple; it effectively performs a JMP to Hook->h_Entry. It is probably just as well to do this operation in an assembly language function linked in to your program, possibly from a compiler supplied library or a builtin function. It is anticipated that C programs will often call a 'varargs' variant of this function which will be named CallHook . This function must be provided in a compiler specific library, but an example of use would be: result = CallHook(hook,dataobject,COMMAND_ID,param1,param2); The function CallHook() can be implemented in many C compilers like this: ULONG CallHook(struct Hook *hook, APTR object, ULONG command, ... ) { return(CallHookPkt(hook,object,(APTR)&command)); } INPUTS hook - pointer to an initialized Hook structure as defined in object - useful data structure in the particular context the hook is being used for. message - pointer to a message to be passed to the hook. This is not an Exec Message structure, but is a message in the OOP sense. RESULTS return - the value returned by the hook function. WARNING The functions called through this function should follow normal register conventions unless EXPLICITLY documented otherwise (and they have a good reason too).
