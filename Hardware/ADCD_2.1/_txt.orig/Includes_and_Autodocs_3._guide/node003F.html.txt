amiga.lib/GetRexxVar ]" border=0> NAME GetRexxVar - Gets the value of a variable from a running ARexx program SYNOPSIS error = GetRexxVar(message,varname,bufpointer) D0,A1 A0 A1 (C-only) LONG GetRexxVar(struct RexxMsg *,char *,char **); FUNCTION This function will attempt to extract the value of the symbol varname from the ARexx script that sent the message. When called from C, a pointer to the extracted value will be placed in the pointer pointed to by bufpointer. (*bufpointer will be the pointer to the value) When called from assembly, the pointer will be returned in A1. The value string returned *MUST* *NOT* be modified. While this function is new in the V37 amiga.lib, it is safe to call it in all versions of the operating system. It is also PURE code, thus usable in resident/pure executables. NOTE This is a stub in amiga.lib. It is only available via amiga.lib. The stub has two labels. One, _GetRexxVar, takes the arguments from the stack. The other, GetRexxVar, takes the arguments in registers. This routine does a CheckRexxMsg() on the message. EXAMPLE char *value; /* Message is one from ARexx */ if (!GetRexxVar(rxmsg,"TheVar",&value)) { /* The value was gotten and now is pointed to by value */ printf("Value of TheVar is %sn",value); } INPUTS message A message gotten from an ARexx script varname The name of the variable to extract bufpointer (For C only) A pointer to a string pointer. RESULTS error 0 for success, otherwise an error code. (Other codes may exists, these are documented) 3 == Insufficient Storage 9 == String too long 10 == invalid message A1 (Assembly only) Pointer to the string.
