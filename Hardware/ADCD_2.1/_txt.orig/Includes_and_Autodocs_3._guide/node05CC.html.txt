window_cl/WM_HANDLEINPUT ]" border=0> NAME WM_HANDLEINPUT -- IDCMP input handling method SYNOPSIS result = DoMethod( winobj, WM_HANDLEINPUT, &code ); FUNCTION This method is used to handle the IDCMP input of a window. Call this method when the signal bit of the window's UserPort is set. This method will return when it encounters a message that requires notifying your application or when the message port no longer contains messages for the window. The return value is two-part. The upper word describes the class of the event the value represents, and the lower word is a modifier that describes the event. Defined class return codes are: WMHI_IGNORE Ignore this event WMHI_LASTMSG No more messages WMHI_CLOSEWINDOW Close gadget hit WMHI_GADGETUP Gadget hit. WMHI_INACTIVE Window went inactive. WMHI_ACTIVE Window was activated. WMHI_NEWSIZE Window was resized. WMHI_MENUPICK A menu item was selected. WMHI_MENUHELP Help was pressed in a menu. WMHI_GADGETHELP A gadget sends a help message. WMHI_ICONIFY Window should be iconified. WMHI_UNICONIFY Window was deiconified. WMHI_RAWKEY Raw key code WMHI_VANILLAKEY Vanilla key code WMHI_CHANGEWINDOW Window moved (or depth arranged) The value of the lower word is defined for WMHI_GADGETUP and WMHI_GADGETHELP as the ID of the gadget, and for WMHI_MENUPICK and WMHI_MENUHELP as the menu code. WMHI_GAGDETHELP uses the special values 0 and WMHI_GADGETMASK as messages "pointer not over your window" and "pointer over your window but not over a gadget". WMHI_RAWKEY returns the raw key ID of the key being pressed (to get the qualifiers also, you have to use the IDCMP hook), and WMHI_VANILLAKEY returns the ASCII value of the key. WMHI_VANILLAKEY is only returned when you set IDCMP_VANILLAKEY. Windowclass itself does not need vanilla key IDCMP. WMHI_NEWSIZE returns some extra information in the low word: if WMF_ZOOMED is set, the window is now in zoomed state. If WMF_ZIPWINDOW is set, this resize was caused by either a click of the zoom gadget or a call to ZipWindow() . WMHI_CHANGEWINDOW is returned when the window is moved. For resizing of the window, listen to WMHI_NEWSIZE. By setting WA_NotifyDepth, this event will also be returned for depth arranging. The lower word contains CWCODE_DEPTH in this case. WMHI_CLASSMASK masks the lower word of the result code out, while WMHI_GADGETMASK and WMHI_MENUMASK mask out the high word, leaving only the ID part of the result value. A generic application side of WM_HANDLEINPUT looks like this: GetAttr( WINDOW_SigMask, winobj, &wsig ); mask = Wait(wsig); /* maybe other signals */ if (mask & wsig) while ((result = DoMethod( winobj, WM_HANDLEINPUT, &code )) != WMHI_LASTMSG) switch (result & WMHI_CLASSMASK) { case WMHI_CLOSEWINDOW: close = TRUE; break; case WMHI_GADGETUP: switch (result & WMHI_GADGETMASK) { /* handle the gadgets here */ } /* handle whatever other events you want here */ } if (close) DisposeObject( winobj ); /* destroy the window */ If you have set up the window to use a shared message port, you can simply call this method on each of the windows: if (mask & wsig) { WmHandleInputWin1(); WmHandleInputWin2(); WmHandleInputWin3(); } INPUTS code -- A pointer to a WORD that should be set to contain the Code value from the IntuiMessage . RESULTS Windowclass will automatically respond with an appropriate action to many input events. When it does not know what to do with an event, it will return with a value as descibed above.
