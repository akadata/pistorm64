arexx_cl/AM_EXECUTE ]" border=0> NAME AM_EXECUTE -- Execute an ARexx macro. FUNCTION This method allows you to execute a macro in another host. The default host is the ARexx server. This is how you would execute disk-based ARexx macros, by passing the name of the file as the command string to the ARexx server. This method uses the following custom message structure: struct apExecute { ULONG MethodID; STRPTR ape_CommandString; STRPTR ape_PortName; LONG *ape_RC; LONG *ape_RC2; STRPTR *ape_Result; BPTR ape_IO; }; ape_CommandString (STRPTR) This must point to the command including arguments to execute. If the command is found in the host command list it will be executed. Unknown commands will be shipped off to the ARexx server. ape_RC, ape_RC2, ape_Result (LONG *, LONG *, STRPTR *) After the command executed you will find the results in here if the command was one in your host, or if there was a problem sending the command to the specified host. You will NOT get the result of the command if it is sent to another host, since the command is sent asychronously. Use AREXX_ReplyHook for this. ape_IO (BPTR) If you execute a script using this method you can pass a pointer to the IO channel ARexx must use here. This IO channel will be closed automatically for you after the command executed. RESULT As errors are reported in acme_RC and acme_RC2 this method has no specific return code.
