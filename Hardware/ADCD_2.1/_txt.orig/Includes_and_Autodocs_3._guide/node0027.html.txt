SYNOPSIS result = CoerceMethod( cl, obj, MethodID, ... ) ULONG CoerceMethod( struct IClass *, Object *, ULONG, ... ); FUNCTION Boopsi support function that invokes the supplied message on the specified object, as though it were the specified class. Equivalent to CoerceMethodA() , but allows you to build the message on the stack. INPUTS cl - pointer to boopsi class to receive the message obj - pointer to boopsi object ... - method-specific message built on the stack RESULT result - class and message-specific result. NOTES This function first appears in the V37 release of amiga.lib. While it intrinsically does not require any particular release of the system software to operate, it is designed to work with the boopsi subsystem of Intuition, which was only introduced in V36.
