cia.resource/AbleICR ]" border=0> NAME AbleICR -- Enable/disable ICR interrupts. SYNOPSIS oldMask = AbleICR( Resource, mask ) D0 A6 D0 WORD AbleICR( struct Library *, WORD ); FUNCTION This function provides a means of enabling and disabling 8520 CIA interrupt control registers. In addition it returns the previous enable mask. INPUTS mask A bit mask indicating which interrupts to be modified. If bit 7 is clear the mask indicates interrupts to be disabled. If bit 7 is set, the mask indicates interrupts to be enabled. Bit positions are identical to those in 8520 ICR. RESULTS oldMask The previous enable mask before the requested changes. To get the current mask without making changes, call the function with a null parameter. EXAMPLES Get the current mask: mask = AbleICR(0) Enable both timer interrupts: AbleICR(0x83) Disable serial port interrupt: AbleICR(0x08) EXCEPTIONS Enabling the mask for a pending interrupt will cause an immediate processor interrupt (that is if everything else is enabled). You may want to clear the pending interrupts with SetICR() prior to enabling them. NOTE The CIA resources are special in that there is more than one of them in the system. Because of this, the C language stubs in amiga.lib for the CIA resources require an extra parameter to specify which CIA resource to use. The synopsis for the amiga.lib stubs is as follows: oldMask = AbleICR( Resource, mask ) D0 A6 D0 WORD AbleICR( struct Library *, WORD ); SEE ALSO cia.resource/SetICR() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
