The message packet's argument fields must be set to either a pointer to a NULL terminated string or an integer value The mask, bits 0 to 15, correspond to the type of value is stored in the argument slot. If the bit is cleared, the argument is a string pointer; if the bit is set, the argument is an integer. INPUTS msgptr - Pointer to a RexxMsg (allocated via CreateRexxMsg) count - The number of argument slots to fill in. This number should be from 1 to 16. mask - A bit mask corresponding to the 16 fields that is used to determine the type of the field. RESULTS result - A boolean. If it is TRUE, the call worked. If it is false, some allocation did not work. All argstrings that were created will be released.
