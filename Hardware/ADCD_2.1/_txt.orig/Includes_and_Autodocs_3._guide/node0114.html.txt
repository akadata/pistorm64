(V39) SYNOPSIS retval = PrintDTObjectA (object, window, requester, msg); d0 a0 a1 a2 a3 ULONG PrintDTObjectA (Object *, struct Window *, struct Requester *, struct dtPrint *); retval = PrintDTObject (object, window, requester, data, ...); ULONG PrintDTObject (Object *, struct Window *, struct Requester *, ULONG, ...); FUNCTION This function is used to asyncronously perform the object's DTM_PRINT method. Once the application has performed the PrintDTObjectA() function, it must not manipulate the printerIO union until it receives a IDCMP_IDCMPUPDATE message that contains the DTA_PrinterStatus tag. To abort a print, the application sends the DTM_ABORTPRINT method to the object. This in turn signals the print process with a SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C. INPUTS object - Pointer to the DataTypes object. window - Pointer to the window that the object has been added to. requester - Pointer to the requester that the object has been added to. RETURNS Returns TRUE if successful, FALSE on error. SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
