Although 'mask' is LONG only the delete bit, NVEF_DELETE/NVEB_DELETE, may be set. If any other bits are set this function will return FALSE. The strings appName and itemName may not contain the '/' or ':' characters. It is recommended that these characters be blocked from user input when requesting AppName and ItemName strings. INPUTS appName - NULL terminated string indicating the application name to be matched. Maximum length is 31. itemName - NULL terminated string indicated the item within the application to be found. Maximum length is 31. mask - the new protection mask. Only set the delete bit otherwise this function WILL CRASH. killRequesters - suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system requesters are to be suppressed during this function. FALSE if system requesters are allowed. RESULT success - FALSE if the protection could not be change (ie the data does not exist). SEE ALSO GetNVList() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
