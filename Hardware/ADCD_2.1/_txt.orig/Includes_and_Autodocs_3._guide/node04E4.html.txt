SUPERCLASS gadgetclass DESCRIPTION Page gadget takes a list of BOOPSI objects and treats each as a single page of a multi-page GUI group. Used together with tabs.gadget and layout.gadget, it allows complex GUI layouts with hidden objects with virtually no work for the developer. This gadget class is contained within the layout.gadget binary. Thus, you will need to OpenLibrary layout.gadget, but not page.gadget. METHODS GM_DOMAIN GM_RENDER GM_LAYOUT DTM_PROCLAYOUT OM_SET OM_UPDATE OM_NEW OM_DISPOSE All other methods are passed to the currently visible object. ATTRIBUTES PAGE_Add (Object *) A BOOPSI gadget (probably a layout.gadget) to add to the end of the page list. Applicability is (OM_NET, OM_SET) PAGE_Remove (Object *) Pointer to a gadget to remove from the page list. page.gadget will automatically dispose all attached objects when disposed of. Applicability is (OM_SET) PAGE_Current (ULONG) Sets/gets the currently visible page. Note that OM_SET will NOT trigger a rerender, call RethinkLayout() afterwards. OM_UPDATE will rerender automatically. Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE) PAGE_FixedVert, PAGE_FixedHoriz (BOOL) Like the respective tags of layout.gadget, these will, if set to FALSE, force the group's dimensions to the smallest possible in the respective direction. Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE) SEE ALSO layout.gadget/--datasheet-- ReAction example source for usage. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
