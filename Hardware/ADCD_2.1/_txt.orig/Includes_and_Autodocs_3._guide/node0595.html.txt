(V39) SYNOPSIS object = AllocNamedObjectA(name, tagList); D0 A0 A1 struct NamedObject *AllocNamedObjectA(STRPTR, struct TagItem *); object = AllocNamedObject(name, Tag1, ...); struct NamedObject *AllocNamedObject(STRPTR, ULONG, ...); FUNCTION Allocates a NamedObject and initializes it as needed to the name given. This object can then be used as an object in the namespaces. Tags can be given to make an object contain a namespace such that nested namespaces can be built. When the object is allocated, it automatically has one use. If you later wish to release this object such that others may remove it from the namespace you must do a ReleaseNamedObject() . INPUTS name - name for the object (must not be NULL) tagList - tags with additional information for the allocation or NULL TAGS ANO_NameSpace - BOOL tag, default FALSE. If this tag is TRUE, the named object will also have a name space attached to it. ANO_UserSpace - ULONG tag, default 0. If this tag is non-NULL it defines the size (in bytes) of the user space to be allocated with the named object and that will be pointed to by the no_Object pointer. This memory is long-word aligned. If no space is defined, no_Object will be NULL. ANO_Priority - BYTE tag, default 0. This tag lets you pick a priority for the named object for when it is placed into a name space. ANO_Flags - ULONG tag, default 0. This tag lets you set the flags of the NameSpace (if you allocated one) There currently are only TWO flags. Do *NOT* set *any* other bits as they are for future use!!! (You can't read them anyway) The flags are: NSF_NODUPS - Name space must be unique. NSF_CASE - Name space is case sensitive RESULT object - the object allocated, or NULL for failure. The object is defined as a pointer to a pointer. You can do what you wish with the pointer. (It may be NULL or contain a pointer to memory that you had asked for in the tags.) SEE ALSO FreeNamedObject() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
