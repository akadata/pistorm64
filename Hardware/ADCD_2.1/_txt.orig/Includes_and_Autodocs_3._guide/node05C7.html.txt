workbench.library/WorkbenchControlA ]" border=0> NAME WorkbenchControlA -- Query or modify Workbench and icon options. (V44) SYNOPSIS success = WorkbenchControlA(name,tags) D0 A0 A1 BOOL WorkbenchControlA(STRPTR name,struct TagItem *tags); success = WorkbenchControl(name,...); BOOL WorkbenchControl(STRPTR name,...); FUNCTION With this function you can query or modify global Workbench parameters or local icon options. INPUTS name -- Name of an object to query or modify. tags -- Additional options. TAGS WBCTRLA_IsOpen (LONG *) -- Check if the named object is currently open. In this case, the function "name" parameter refers to the drawer that should be tested; the result value will be set to TRUE if the named drawer is currently open, FALSE otherwise. WBCTRLA_DuplicateSearchPath (BPTR *) -- This is a safe way to obtain a copy of the Workbench search path list. You will receive a BPTR to a path list, such as can be stored in the cli_CommandDir pointer of a CommandLineInterface structure. Note that this is really a copy of the Workbench search path list and not a reference to the data associated with the Workbench process. Thus, it can be freed by FreeDosObject(DOS_CLI,..), if part of a CommandLineInterface structure. WBCTRLA_FreeSearchPath (BPTR) -- If you did not attach the data returned by the WBCTRLA_DuplicateSearchPath to a CLI, to be freed automatically later, you can pass it back to WorkbenchControlA() to be released. WBCTRLA_GetDefaultStackSize (ULONG *) -- Get the default stack size used by Workbench when launching Shell programs or programs without a valid stack size number. The default stack size is 4096 bytes. WBCTRLA_SetDefaultStackSize (ULONG) -- Set the default stack size used by Workbench when launching Shell programs or programs without a valid stack size number. You cannot set a stack size number smaller than 4096 bytes WBCTRLA_RedrawAppIcon (struct AppIcon *) -- This tag will cause Workbench to redraw an AppIcon . Note that due to which state the Workbench is currently in, it may refuse to redraw the icon. WBCTRLA_GetProgramList (struct List **) -- You can obtain a list of currently running Workbench programs; every entry of this list will have the complete path to the program and the program name in its Node->ln_Name. When you no longer need the list, don't forget to free it again using the tag WBCTRLA_FreeProgramList. Note that the list you will receive may be empty. Be prepared to handle this. WBCTRLA_FreeProgramList (struct List *) -- With this tag you can free the list allocated by the WBCTRLA_GetProgramList tag. WBCTRLA_GetSelectedIconList (struct List **) -- You can obtain a list of currently selected icons; every entry of this list will have the complete path to the icon and the icon name in its Node->ln_Name. Some icons do not enter the list, such as AppIcons. When you no longer need the list, don't forget to free it again using the tag WBCTRLA_FreeSelectedIconList. Note that the list you will receive may be empty. Be prepared to handle this. WBCTRLA_FreeSelectedIconList (struct List *) -- With this tag you can free the list allocated by the WBCTRLA_GetSelectedIconList tag. WBCTRLA_GetOpenDrawerList (struct List **) -- You can obtain a list of currently open drawers and volumes; every entry of this list will have the complete drawer path name in its Node->ln_Name. When you no longer need the list, don't forget to free it again using the tag WBCTRLA_FreeOpenDrawerList. Note that the list you will receive may be empty. Be prepared to handle this. WBCTRLA_FreeOpenDrawerList (struct List *) -- With this tag you can free the list allocated by the WBCTRLA_GetOpenDrawerList tag. WBCTRLA_AddHiddenDeviceName (STRPTR) -- Name of a device which Workbench should not display a disk or device icon for. Any such device will be effectively hidden from the Workbench backdrop. The name must include a terminating colon character, such as in "DF0:". Note that adding new entries to this list may not immediately take effect. WBCTRLA_RemoveHiddenDeviceName (STRPTR) -- Name of a device on the list of devices to be hidden which should be removed. The name must include a terminating colon character, such as in "DF0:". Trying to remove an entry from the list that is not on it will have no effect. Note that removing entries from this list may not immediately take effect. WBCTRLA_GetHiddenDeviceList (struct List **) -- This will obtain the list of devices whose contents which Workbench will not display. Note that the list you will receive may be empty. Be prepared to handle this. WBCTRLA_FreeHiddenDeviceList (struct List *) -- With this tag you can free the list allocated by the WBCTRLA_GetHiddenDeviceList tag. WBCTRLA_GetTypeRestartTime (ULONG *) -- Get the number of seconds that have to pass before typing the next character in a drawer window will restart with a new file name. WBCTRLA_SetTypeRestartTime (ULONG) -- Set the number of seconds that have to pass before typing the next character in a drawer window will restart with a new file name. You must specify a number greater than 0. Default type restart time is 3 seconds. RESULTS result -- FALSE if the requested action could not be performed, TRUE otherwise. If FALSE is returned, you can query the error code using dos.library/IoErr() . NOTES If this function returns FALSE, the expected result is undefined. For example, if you tried to obtain the list of currently running programs via the WBCTRLA_GetProgramList tag and WorkbenchControl() failed with an error code, do not expect the List pointer you passed in to be initialized. This function may only be called by a Process . This function may not process all tags if the Workbench is not currently open. For V44, the following tags are support if Workbench is closed: WBCTRLA_SetDefaultStackSize WBCTRLA_GetDefaultStackSize WBCTRLA_FreeHiddenDeviceList WBCTRLA_GetHiddenDeviceList WBCTRLA_AddHiddenDeviceName WBCTRLA_RemoveHiddenDeviceName WBCTRLA_SetTypeRestartTime WBCTRLA_GetTypeRestartTime EXAMPLE /* Obtain a copy of the Workbench search path list, then * release it again. */ BPTR pathList; if(WorkbenchControl(NULL, WBCTRLA_DuplicateSearchPath,&pathList, TAG_DONE)) { WorkbenchControl(NULL, WBCTRLA_FreeSearchPath,pathList, TAG_DONE); } /* Check if the drawer "SYS:" is open. */ LONG isOpen; if(WorkbenchControl("SYS:", WBCTRLA_IsOpen,&isOpen, TAG_DONE)) { Printf("Drawer "SYS:" is %s.n", isOpen ? "open" : "closed"); } /* Print the list of all currently running * Workbench programs, then free the list again. */ struct List * list; if(WorkbenchControl(NULL, WBCTRLA_GetProgramList,&list, TAG_DONE)) { struct Node * node; for(node = list->lh_Head ; node->ln_Succ != NULL ; node = node->ln_Succ) { Printf("%sn",node->ln_Name); } WorkbenchControl(NULL, WBCTRLA_FreeProgramList,list, TAG_DONE); } SEE ALSO dos.library/FreeDosObject dos.library/IoErr [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
