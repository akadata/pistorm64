(V36) SYNOPSIS InsertCxObj(headObj,co,pred); A0 A1 A2 VOID InsertCxObj(CxObj *, CxObj *, CxObj *); FUNCTION Adds 'co' to the list of objects pointed to by 'headObj' after object 'pred'. INPUTS headObj - pointer to a list of objects. If this value is NULL, then the entire tree of objects pointed to by 'co' is deleted and becomes invalid. co - the object to add to the list (may be NULL) pred - the object after which 'co' should be inserted. If this is NULL then 'co' is added to the head of the list. RESULTS If 'co' is NULL, this function will record that fact in the internal accumulated error of 'headObj'. This error record can be retrieved using CxObjError() and cleared using ClearCxObjError() . BUGS Until V38, passing a NULL 'headObj' parameter would cause low-memory access and unpredictable results.
