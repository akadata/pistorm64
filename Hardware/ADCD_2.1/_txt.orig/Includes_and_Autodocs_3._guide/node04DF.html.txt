(V40) SYNOPSIS information = GetNVInfo(killRequesters); D0 D1 struct NVInfo *GetNVInfo(BOOL); FUNCTION Finds the user's preferred nonvolatile device and reports information about it. INPUTS killRequesters - suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system requesters are to be suppressed during this function. FALSE if system requesters are allowed. RESULT information - pointer to an NVInfo structure. This structure contains information on the NV storage media with the largest storage. The structure contains 2 longword fields: nvi_MaxStorage and nvi_FreeStorage. Both values are rounded down to the nearest ten. The nvi_MaxStorage field is defined as the total amount of nonvolatile storage available on this device. The nvi_FreeStorage is defined as the amount of available space for NVDISK or the amount of non-locked storage for NVRAM. For NVDISK, the nvi_FreeStorage takes into account the amount of overhead room required to store a new App/Item. This amount is 3 blocks to allow room for storing a new Item file and possibly a new App directory. For NVRAM, the amount of overhead is 5 bytes. However, the amount of room required to store a new NVRAM item depends on the length of the App and Item names. Refer to StoreNV() function for storage details. This function may return NULL in the case of failure. SEE ALSO FreeNVData() , StoreNV() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
