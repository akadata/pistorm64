SetListBrowserNodeAttrs(node, firsttag, ...) VOID SetListBrowserNodeAttrsA(struct Node *, struct TagItem *) SetListBrowserNodeAttrsA(node, taglist) FUNCTION Changes attributes for a ListBrowser node. Since the ListBrowser class uses a private node structure, this is the only way to change node attributes. You may NOT change node attributes when the node is in a list attached to a ListBrowser gadget. You must first detach the list with LISTBROWSER_Labels, ~0 before you can change attributes, and then re-attach the list. TAGS LBNA_Selected (BOOL) If this node is currently selected or not in a multi-select list browser. This field is not meaningful in a single- select list browser. LBNA_Flags (ULONG) Flags for this node. See ListBrowser.h for available flags. LBNA_Generation (WORD) Sets which "generation" this node belongs to, if the ListBrowser is to be in hierarchical mode. If you were to draw the nodes out in a sort of family tree, the generation would refer to the level in the tree. Generations start at 1. A generation 1 node's children will be generation 2, you cannot skip generations. Nodes need not have children and generations can go as deep as you like, limited by the available stack of input.device. LBNA_UserData (APTR) Abritrary user data for this node. LBNA_Column (WORD) A column (from 0 to number_of_columns-1) that the column attribute tags below (LBNA_Text, LBNA_Integer, LBNA_FGPen, LBNA_BGPen, LBNA_Image, LBNA_SelImage, LBNA_Justification) affect. You typically specify the column to work on, and then the column attributes for that column, then the next column followed by its attributes, etc. LBNCA_Text (STRPTR) Text that is to appear in the corresponding column for this node. Only one of LBNA_Text, LBNA_Integer and LBNCA_Image may be non-NULL, specifying the type of contents for this column. Each column of a node need not have the same type of contents. Similarly, the same column in different nodes also need not have the same type of contents. LBNCA_CopyText (BOOL) Specifies that you want the LBNCA_Text copied to an internal buffer by ListBrowser. LBNCA_Editable (BOOL) Specifies that this item can be edited. If the user clicks twice on this entry, the text will become a string gadget where the user can edit the contents. This will only work if the contents are text (given with LBNCA_Text) AND if LBNCA_CopyText was used. You MUST also specify LBNCA_MaxChars to specify how long the edited text can be. LBNCA_MaxChars(WORD) Maximum number of characters an editable text entry can be. LBNCA_Integer (LONG *) A pointer to an integer to display in this column, or NULL. LBNCA_FGPen, LBNA_BGPen (WORD) The pens to be used for rendering the text or integer in this column. Requires that the LBFLG_CUSTOMPENS flag be specified, otherwise the default system pens will be used. LBNCA_Image, LBNA_SelImage (struct Image *) Specifies that the column should contain an image. The selected image is optional, if not provided, LBNA_Image will be rendered in the IDS_SELECTED state when then node is selected. LBNCA_Justification (WORD) Specifies a justification for the column, either LCJ_LEFT, LCJ_CENTRE or LCJ_RIGHT. LBNA_CheckBox (BOOL) (V41) Means that this node will be a checkbox node, that can be toggled on or off. Defaults to FALSE. LBNA_Checked (BOOL) (V41) Indicates whether a checkbox node is in the checked or unchecked state. Defaults to FALSE. LBNCA_EditTags (struct TagItem *) (V41) Tags that you want to be passed to the string gadget used when editing gadget text. Though you could theoretically pass any tags to the gadget, you should generally not pass tags that affect the position of the gadget. Defaults to NULL. LBNCA_RenderHook (struct Hook *) (V41) A custom render hook for this node column. You hook will receive a pointer to struct Node of the node in question as its object, and the following structure in the message pointer: struct LBDrawMsg { ULONG lbdm_MethodID; /* LV_DRAW */ struct RastPort *lbdm_RastPort; /* Where to render to */ struct DrawInfo *lbdm_DrawInfo; /* Useful to have around */ struct Rectangle lbdm_Bounds; /* Limits of where to render */ ULONG lbdm_State; /* How to render */ }; LBDrawMsg.lbdm_State will be either LBR_SELECTED or LBR_NORMAL. The hook should return LBCB_OK if rendering was successful, or LBCB_UNKNOWN if lbdm_Method doesn't equal LV_DRAW. No rendering should be performed in this case. Note that this is HIGHLY compatible with a GadTools listhook. Defaults to NULL. LBNCA_HookHeight (WORD) (V41) The height of this column, when using LBNCA_RenderHook. LBNA_MemPool (APTR) (V42) Specifies a custom memory pool to allocate listbrowser nodes from. Defaults to NULL (internal pool). LBNCA_WordWrap (BOOL) (V42) Specifies this column's text can be word wrapped. Useful in weighted column displays or fixed pixels columns. Primarily this feature exists at the request of IRC client authors. Initial implementation in V42.630 is slow. Improvement to be made. Defaults to FALSE. INPUTS node - Node whose attributes you are changing. taglist - Tag list of attributes to change. SEE ALSO GetListBrowserNodeAttrsA() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
