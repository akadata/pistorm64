SYNOPSIS SetRGB4( vp, n, r, g, b) a0 d0 d1:4 d2:4 d3:4 void SetRGB4( struct ViewPort *, SHORT , UBYTE , UBYTE , UBYTE ); FUNCTION Change the color look up table so that this viewport displays the color (r,g,b) for pen number n. INPUTS vp - pointer to viewport structure n - the color number (range from 0 to 31) r - red level (0-15) g - green level (0-15) b - blue level (0-15) RESULT If there is a ColorMap for this viewport, then the value will be stored in the ColorMap . The selected color register is changed to match your specs. If the color value is unused then nothing will happen. BUGS NOTE: Under V36 and up, it is not safe to call this function from an interrupt, due to semaphore protection of graphics copper lists.
