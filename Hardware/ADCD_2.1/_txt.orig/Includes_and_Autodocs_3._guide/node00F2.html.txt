commodities.library/MatchIX ]" border=0> NAME MatchIX -- see if an input event matches an initialized input expression. (V38) SYNOPSIS match = MatchIX(event,ix); D0 A0 A1 BOOL MatchIX(struct InputEvent *,IX *); FUNCTION This function determines whether an input event matches an initialized input expression. Applications generally do not need to call this function as filter objects will normally provide all the event filtering needed. Nevertheless, MatchIX() can come in handy as it is the same function used to match an event to the various filter objects when an event makes its way through the input network. INPUTS event - the input event to match against the input expression ix - the input expression for the comparison RESULTS match - TRUE if the input event matches the input expression, or FALSE if not SEE ALSO , ParseIX() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
