(V36) SYNOPSIS Error = ReadBattMem( Buffer, Offset, Len ) D0 A0 D0 D1 ULONG ReadBattMem( APTR , ULONG, ULONG ); FUNCTION Read a bitstring from nonvolatile ram. INPUTS Buffer Where to put the bitstring. Offset Bit offset of first bit to read. Len Length of bitstring to read. RESULTS Error Zero if no error. NOTES The battery-backed memory is checksummed. If a checksum error is detected, all bits in the battery-backed memory are silently set to zero. Bits in the battery-backed memory that do not exist are read as zero. Partial byte reads (less than 8 bits) result in the bits read being put in the low-order bits of the destination byte. SEE ALSO BUGS [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
