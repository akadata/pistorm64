gadtools.library/GT_PostFilterIMsg ]" border=0> NAME GT_PostFilterIMsg -- return the unfiltered message after GT_FilterIMsg() was called, and clean up. (V36) SYNOPSIS imsg = GT_PostFilterIMsg(modimsg) D0 A1 struct IntuiMessage *GT_PostFilterIMsg(struct IntuiMessage *); FUNCTION NOTE WELL: Extremely few programs will actually need this function. You almost certainly should be using GT_GetIMsg() and GT_ReplyIMsg() only, and not GT_FilterIMsg() and GT_PostFilterIMsg(). Performs any clean-up necessitated by a previous call to GT_FilterIMsg() . The original IntuiMessage is now yours to handle. Do not interpret the fields of the original IntuiMessage , but rather use only the one you got from GT_FilterIMsg() . You may only do message related things at this point, such as queueing it up or replying it. Since you got the message with exec.library/GetMsg() , your responsibilities do include replying it with exec.library/ReplyMsg() . This function may be safely called with a NULL parameter. INPUTS modimsg - a modified IntuiMessage obtained with GT_FilterIMsg() , or NULL in which case this function does nothing and returns NULL RESULT imsg - a pointer to the original IntuiMessage , if GT_FilterIMsg() returned non-NULL. NOTES Be sure to use exec.library/ReplyMsg() on the original IntuiMessage you obtained with GetMsg() , (which is the what you passed to GT_FilterIMsg() ), and not on the parameter of this function. Starting with V39, this function actually expects and returns pointers to ExtIntuiMessage structures, but the prototype was not changed for source code compatibility with older software.
