locale.library/FormatString ]" border=0> NAME FormatString -- format data into a character stream. (V38) SYNOPSIS next = FormatString(locale,fmtTemplate,dataStream,putCharFunc); D0 A0 A1 A2 A3 APTR FormatString(struct Locale *, STRPTR , APTR ,struct Hook *); FUNCTION This function performs C-language-like formatting of a data stream, outputting the result a character at a time. Where % formatting commands are found in the formatting template, they are replaced with the corresponding elements in 'dataStream'. %% must be used in the string if a % is desired in the output. An extension to the standard C-language printf() conventions used by FormatString() is argument position specification. Specifying the argument position lets the order of the % commands change while the arguments provided remain the same. Using the C printf() call as an example: printf("%d eyes, %d feet and %d ears",eyes,feet,ears); printf("%3$d ears, %1$d eyes and %2$d feet",eyes,feet,ears); These two statements would produce the following output: "2 eyes, 3 feet and 4 ears" for the first "4 ears, 2 eyes and 3 feet" for the second The argument positioning feature lets you change the format string being processed while keeping the data stream the same. This is an invaluable tool when translating strings to different languages. INPUTS locale - the locale to use for the formatting fmtTemplate - a C-language-like NULL-terminated format string, with the following supported % options: %[arg_pos$][flags][width][.limit][length]type arg_pos - ordinal position of the argument for this command within the array of arguments pointed to by 'dataStream' $ - must follow the arg_pos value, if specified flags - only one allowed. '-' specifies left justification. width - field width. If the first character is a '0', the field is padded with leading 0s. . - must precede the field limit value, if specified limit - maximum number of characters to output from a string. (only valid for %s or %b). length - size of input data defaults to word (16-bit) for types c, d, u and x, 'l' changes this to long (32-bit). type - supported types are: b - BSTR, data is 32-bit BPTR to byte count followed by a byte string. A NULL BPTR is treated as an empty string. d - signed decimal D - signed decimal using the locale's formatting conventions u - unsigned decimal U - unsigned decimal using the locale's formatting conventions x - hexadecimal with hex digits in uppercase X - hexadecimal with hex digits in lowercase s - string, a 32-bit pointer to a NULL-terminated byte string. A NULL pointer is treated as an empty string. c - character If the formatting template parameter is NULL, the function returns without outputting anything. Note the meaning of %x and %X are swapped with respect to standard C conventions. This is for compatibility with exec.library/RawDoFmt() . dataStream - a stream of data that is interpreted according to the format string. Often this is a pointer into the task's stack. putCharFunc - a callback hook invoked for every character generated, including for the terminating NULL character. The hook is called with: A0 - address of Hook structure A1 - character for hook to process (not a pointer!) A2 - locale pointer the function is called with a NULL char at the end of the format string. RESULT next - A pointer to beyond the last data element used in 'dataStream' (the next argument that would have been processed). This allows multiple formatting passes to be made using the same data. WARNING This function formats word values in the data stream. If your compiler defaults to longs, you must add an "l" to your specifications. This can get strange for characters, which might look like "%lc". SEE ALSO exec.library/RawDoFmt() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
