This can be used to implement double (or triple) buffering, a method of achieving smooth animation. INPUTS vp = a pointer to a viewport bm = a pointer to a BitMap structure. This BitMap structure must be of the same layout as the one attached to the viewport (same depth, alignment, and BytesPerRow). db = A pointer to a DBufInfo . BUGS NOTES This will set the vp->RasInfo->BitMap field to the bm pointer which is passed. When using the synchronization features, you MUST carefully insure that all messages have been replied to before calling FreeDBufInfo or calling ChangeVPBitMap with the same DBufInfo .
