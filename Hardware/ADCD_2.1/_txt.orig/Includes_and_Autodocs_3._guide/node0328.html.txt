(V39) SYNOPSIS SetRGB32( vp, n, r, g, b) a0 d0 d1 d2 d3 void SetRGB32( struct ViewPort *, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG ); INPUTS vp = viewport n = the number of the color register to set. r = red level (32 bit left justified fraction) g = green level (32 bit left justified fraction) b = blue level (32 bit left justified fraction) RESULT If there is a ColorMap for this viewport, then the value will be stored in the ColorMap . The selected color register is changed to match your specs. If the color value is unused then nothing will happen. BUGS NOTES Lower order bits of the palette specification will be discarded, depending on the color palette resolution of the target graphics device. Use 0xffffffff for the full value, 0x7fffffff for 50%, etc. You can find out the palette range for your screen by querying the graphics data base.
