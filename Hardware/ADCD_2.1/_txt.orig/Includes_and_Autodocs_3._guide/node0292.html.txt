getfont.gadget/GETFONT_GetClass ]" border=0> NAME GETFONT_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the font requester class SYNOPSIS getfont_class = GETFONT_GetClass(); D0 Class * GETFONT_GetClass( void ); FUNCTION Obtains the pointer to the getfont gadget class for use with NewObject() . This function always returns a valid pointer so you do not need to check it. The reason is that if the library opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup. (Of course this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be calling this.) Note that this function does not create the class, that is done when the class library is opened. INPUTS RESULT getfont_class - Pointer to the getfont gadget class. EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
