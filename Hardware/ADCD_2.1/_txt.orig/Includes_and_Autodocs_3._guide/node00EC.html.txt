(V36) SYNOPSIS DeleteCxObjAll(co); A0 VOID DeleteCxObjAll(CxObj *); FUNCTION This function deletes the commodity object 'co', and recursively deletes all objects attached to it, and the objects attached to them, etc. If 'co' is linked into a list, it is first removed. Note that the handle 'co' is invalid after this function is called. This function is useful when an application exits: most applications can clean up completely by deleting the entire sub-tree of objects starting at their broker. INPUTS co - the first commodity object to delete (may be NULL) SEE ALSO DeleteCxObj() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
