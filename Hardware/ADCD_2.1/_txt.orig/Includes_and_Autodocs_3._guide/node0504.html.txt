printer.device/CallErrHook ]" border=0> NAME CallErrHook -- internal call of error hook SYNOPSIS result = (*PrinterData->pd_CallErrHook)(hook, iorequest, msg); D0 LONG CallErrHook(struct Hook *, struct IORequest *, struct PrtErrMsg *); FUNCTION An application can set an error hook that is called in case of errors to display an formated and localized error message to the user. The driver can set an error hook to format and localize custom error messages and to call the application's error hook. This is done by calling PD->pd_CallErrHook() from the printer.device. CallErrHook will do additional formating like setting a title of the error message if no is set by the driver and then calls the application's error hook. RESULT The return value of the hook is returned from CallErrHook. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
