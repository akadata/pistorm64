SYNOPSIS Prefs = GetPrefs( PrefBuffer, Size ) D0 A0 D0 struct Preferences *GetPrefs( struct Preferences *, WORD ); FUNCTION Gets a copy of the current Intuition Preferences structure. Writes the data into the buffer you specify. The number of bytes you want copied is specified by the size argument. It is legal to take a partial copy of the Preferences structure. The more pertinent preferences variables have been grouped near the top of the structure to facilitate the memory conservation that can be had by taking a copy of only some of the Preferences structure. New for V36: A new and more extensible method for supplying Preferences has been introduced in V36, and relies on file system notification. The Intuition preferences items rely also on the IPrefs program. Certain elements of the Preferences structure have been superseded by this new method. As much as possible, the Preferences structure returned by GetPrefs() reflect the current state of Preferences . However, it is impossible to represent some of the V36-style preferences items using the existing Preferences structure. INPUTS PrefBuffer = pointer to the memory buffer to receive your copy of the Intuition Preferences Size = the number of bytes in your PrefBuffer, the number of bytes you want copied from the system's internal Preference settings RESULT Returns your parameter PrefBuffer.
