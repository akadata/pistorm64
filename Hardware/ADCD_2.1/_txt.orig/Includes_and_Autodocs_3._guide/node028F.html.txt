getfile.gadget/GETFILE_GetClass ]" border=0> NAME GETFILE_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the file requester class SYNOPSIS getfile_class = GETFILE_GetClass(); D0 Class * GETFILE_GetClass( void ); FUNCTION Obtains the pointer to the getfile gadget class for use with NewObject() . This function always returns a valid pointer so you do not need to check it. The reason is that if the library opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup. (Of course this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be calling this.) Note that this function does not create the class, that is done when the class library is opened. INPUTS RESULT getfile_class - Pointer to the getfile gadget class. EXAMPLE NOTES The GFILE_REQUEST method will return 0 if no file is selected and the GETFILE_DrawersOnly tag is not used, even is the user selected the positive response in the requester. If a file is selected (the file gadget in the file requester is not empty), it will return 1. BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
