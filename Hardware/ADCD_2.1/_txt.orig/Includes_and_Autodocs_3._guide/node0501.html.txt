SYNOPSIS WritePotgo(word, mask) D0 D1 void WritePotgo( UWORD , UWORD ); FUNCTION The WritePotgo routine sets and clears bits in the hardware potgo register. Only those bits specified by the mask are affected -- it is improper to set bits in the mask that you have not successfully allocated. The bits in the high byte are saved to be maintained when other users write to the potgo register. The START bit is not saved, it is written only explicitly as the result of a call to this routine with the START bit set: other users will not restart it. INPUTS word - the data to write to the hardware potgo register and save for further use, except the START bit, which is not saved. mask - those bits in word that are to be written. Other bits may have been provided by previous calls to this routine, and default to zero. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
