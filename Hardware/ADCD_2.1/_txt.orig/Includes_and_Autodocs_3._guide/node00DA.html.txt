clipboard.device/CMD_WRITE ]" border=0> NAME CMD_WRITE -- Write to a clip on the clipboard. FUNCTION This command writes data to the clipboard. This data can be provided sequentially by clearing io_Offset for the initial write, and using the incremented value unaltered for subsequent writes. If io_Offset is ever beyond the current clip size, the clip is padded with zeros. If this write is in response to a SatisfyMsg for a pending post, then the io_ClipID returned by the CBD_POST command must be used. Otherwise, a new ID is obtained by clearing the io_ClipID for the first write. Subsequent writes must not alter the io_ClipID. IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort set up io_Device preset by OpenDevice io_Unit preset by OpenDevice io_Command CMD_WRITE io_Length number of bytes from io_Data to write io_Data pointer to block of data to write io_Offset usually zero if this is the initial write io_ClipID zero if this is the initial write, ClipID of the Post if this is to satisfy a post RESULTS io_Error non-zero if an error occurred io_Actual filled with the actual number of bytes written io_Offset updated to next write position io_ClipID the clip ID assigned to this write: do not alter for subsequent writes [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
