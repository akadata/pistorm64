(V38) SYNOPSIS result = StrnCmp(locale,string1,string2,length,type); D0 A0 A1 A2 D0 D1 LONG StrnCmp(struct Locale *, STRPTR , STRPTR , LONG ,ULONG); FUNCTION Compares string1 to string2 according to the collation information provided by the locale and returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than zero, accordingly as the string pointed to by string1 is greater than, equal to, or less than the string pointed to by string2. The length parameter specifies how many characters to compare, or if the length is specified as -1 then the strings are compared until a NULL is encountered. The type parameter dictates how the comparison is to be performed. INPUTS locale - the locale to use for this comparison string1 - NULL-terminated string string2 - NULL-terminated string length - the maximum number of characters to be compared, or -1 to compare all characters until a NULL is encountered type - describes how the comparison is to be performed. The following values can be passed: SC_ASCII causes an ASCII-based case-insensitive comparison to be performed. SC_ASCII is the fastest of the comparison types, but it uses ASCII ordering and considers accented characters different than their non-accented counterparts. SC_COLLATE1 causes the characters to be compared using their primary sorting order. This effectively produces a comparison that ignores letter case and diacritical marks. That is, letters such as "e" and "é" are treated as if they were both "e". SC_COLLATE2 causes the characters to be compared using both their primary and secondary sorting order. SC_COLLATE2 is slower than SC_COLLATE1. This is the type of comparison to use when sorting data to be presented to the user. It operates in two passes. First it performs a comparison equivalent to SC_COLLATE1. If both strings compare the same, then a second pass is made using the secondary sorting order, which gives finer resolution to the comparison. For example, SC_COLLATE1 would return the following strings as identical: "père" and "pere" since SC_COLLATE1 ignores diacritical marks. SC_COLLATE2 would make a second pass over the string comparing diacritical marks instead of actual characters.
