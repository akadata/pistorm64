card.resource/CardMiscControl ]" border=0> NAME CardMiscControl -- Set/Clear miscellaneous control bits SYNOPSIS control_bits=CardMiscControl( handle, control_bits ); d0 a1 d1 UBYTE CardMiscControl( struct CardHandle *, UBYTE ); FUNCTION Used to set/clear miscellaneous control bits (generally for use with I/O cards). INPUTS handle - Same handle as that used when OwnCard() was called. control_bits - A mask value of control bits to be turned on/off. The bit values which might be usable are defined in card.h/i. For example, to enable digital audio, and disable hardware write-protect (if supported), you would call this function with these values -- CARDF_DISABLE_WP|CARDF_ENABLE_DIGAUDIO Then to turn off digital audio, but leave write-protect disable, you would use a value of -- CARDF_DISABLE_WP Finally too reenable write protect, call this function with a mask value of 0. RETURNS control_bits - The same mask value you called this function with if successful. If one, or more bits has been cleared in the return mask, this would indicate that the control bit is not being supported, or that the card has been removed by the user. For example, if you called this function with a mask value of -- CARDF_DISABLE_WP|CARDF_ENABLE_DIGAUDIO And this function returned a value of -- CARDF_DISABLE_WP This would indicate that it is not possible to enable digital audio (most likely because this feature has not been implemented). NOTES This function may be called from within a task, or from a level 1 or level 2 interrupt. !!!IMPORTANT!!! You should ALWAYS try to enable digital audio for I/O cards as this will also configure the card socket for the I/O interface (if supported). Not all cards will connect the write-enable line (e.g., some I/O cards). On some machines (e.g., the A600) it will not be possible to write to such cards unless you disable write-protection by using this function. !!!NEW!!! For card.resource V39 (check resource base for VERSION before using), new bits have been defined which let you enable/disable particular status change interrupts. See CardInterface() for defaults. These new bits are backwards compatable with V37 for which only the CARDB_DISABLE_WP, and CARDB_ENABLE_DIGAUDIO bits were defined. These new bits allow you to enable, or disable specific status change interrupts including BVD1/SC, BVD2/DA, and BSY/IRQ. The defaults for these status change interrupts are unchanged from V37, and WR (Write-protect) status change interrupts are always enabled as they use to be. An example of use: CARD_INTF_SETCLR!CARD_INTF_BVD1 Would enable BVD1/SC status change interrupts, and not change the enable/disable state for BVD2/DA or BSY/IRQ status change interrupts. If the change was made successfully, the CARD_INTB_BVD1 bit would be set in register D0 when this function returns.
