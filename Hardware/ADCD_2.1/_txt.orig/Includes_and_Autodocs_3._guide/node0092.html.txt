Its purpose is to force a credit-card change as if the user had removed, or inserted a card.

RESULT TRUE if the function succeeded, FALSE if card change is not allowed. This function will generally succeed, unless someone is using the card in reset remove mode at the time this function is called. NOTES This function should only be called from a task.
