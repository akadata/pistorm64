trackdisk.device/TD_EJECT ]" border=0> NAME TD_EJECT -- eject (or load) the disk in the drive, if possible. FUNCTION This command causes the drive to attempt to eject the disk in it, if any. Note that the current trackdisk.device does not implement this command, but it might in the future, and other trackdisk-compatible drivers may implement this command. Some devices may be able to load disks on command also. IO REQUEST INPUT io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command TD_EJECT io_Flags 0 or IOF_QUICK io_Length 0 (load, if supported) or 1 (eject) IO REQUEST RESULT io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in BUGS The pre-V40 autodoc didn't mention io_Length. Because of this, for devices that can never support load, a driver might want to eject if io_Length is 0. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
