(V39) SYNOPSIS SetABPenDrMd( rp, apen, bpen, mode ) a1 d0 d1 d2 void SetABPenDrMd( struct RastPort *, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG ); FUNCTION Set the pen values and drawing mode for lines, fills and text. Get the bit definitions from rastport.h INPUTS rp - pointer to RastPort structure. apen - primary pen value bpen - secondary pen value mode - 0-255, some combinations may not make much sense. RESULT The mode set is dependent on the bits selected. Changes minterms to reflect new drawing mode and colors. Sets line drawer to restart pattern. NOTES This call is essentially the same as a sequence of SetAPen()/SetBPen()/SetDrMD() calls, except that it is significantly faster. The minterms will only be generated once, or not at all if nothing changed (warning to illegal RastPort pokers!).
