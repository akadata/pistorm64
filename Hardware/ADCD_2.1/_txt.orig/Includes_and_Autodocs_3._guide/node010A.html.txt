(V39) SYNOPSIS retval = DoAsyncLayout (object, gpl); d0 a0 a1 ULONG DoAsyncLayout (Object *, struct gpLayout *); FUNCTION This function is used to asyncronously perform the object's DTM_ASYNCLAYOUT method. This is used to offload the layout method from input.device. The DTM_ASYNCLAYOUT method must exit when SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C signal is set.
