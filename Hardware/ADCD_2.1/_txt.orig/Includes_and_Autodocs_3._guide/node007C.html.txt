(V36) SYNOPSIS Error = WriteBattMem( Buffer, Offset, Len ) D0 A0 D0 D1 ULONG WriteBattMem( APTR , ULONG, ULONG ); FUNCTION Write a bitstring to the nonvolatile ram. INPUTS Buffer Where to get the bitstring. Offset Bit offset of first bit to write. Len Length of bitstring to write. RESULTS Error Zero if no error. NOTES The battery-backed memory is checksummed. If a checksum error is detected, all bits in the battery-backed memory are silently set to zero. Partial byte writes (less than 8 bits) result in the bits written being read from the low-order bits of the source byte. SEE ALSO BUGS [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
