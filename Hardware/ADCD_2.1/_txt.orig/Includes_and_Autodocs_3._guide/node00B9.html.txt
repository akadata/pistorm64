IO REQUEST io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command CD_TOCMSF io_Data pointer to array where TOC is to be stored io_Length number of CDTOC entries to be fetched io_Offset entry to begin at (entry 0 is summary information) RESULTS io_Error 0 for success, or an error code as defined in io_Actual Actual number of entries copied FUNCTION This command returns the table of contents of the disk currently in the drive. The table of contents consists of up to 100 entries. Entry zero is summary information describing the number of tracks and the total number of minutes on the disk. Entries 1 through N contain information about each individual track. All position information will be in MSF format. The io_Data field points to an array of CDTOC structures to receive the TOC data. The io_Length field specifies the total number of entries to be fetched. The array pointed to by io_Data must be at least this many elements in size. The io_Offset field specifies the entry number at which to start copying TOC data into *io_Data. Entry zero (the summary entry) contains the following: struct TOCSummary { UBYTE FirstTrack; /* First track on disk (always 1) */ UBYTE LastTrack; /* Last track on disk */ union LSNMSF LeadOut; /* Beginning of lead-out track */ }; Track entries (entries 1 through number of tracks) contain: struct TOCEntry { UBYTE CtlAdr; /* Q-Code info */ UBYTE Track; /* Track number */ union LSNMSF Position; /* Start position of this track */ }; CDTOC is described as a union between these two structures: union CDTOC { struct TOCSummary Summary; /* First entry is summary info. */ struct TOCEntry Entry; /* Entries 1-N are track entries */ }; EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
