INPUTS RealViewPort - ViewPort to coerce MonitorID - Montor number to coerce to (ie a mode masked with MONITOR_ID_MASK). Flags - PRESERVE_COLORS - keep the number of bitplanes in the ViewPort . AVOID_FLICKER - do not coerce to an interlace mode RESULTS ID - ID of the best mode to coerce to, or INVALID_ID if could not coerce (see NOTES). NOTES This function takes into account the compatibility of the Monitor being coerced to, and the ViewPort that is being coerced. Incompatibilities will cause a result of INVALID_ID. EXAMPLE newmode = CoerceMode(vp, VGA_MONITOR_ID, PRESERVE_COLORS); SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
