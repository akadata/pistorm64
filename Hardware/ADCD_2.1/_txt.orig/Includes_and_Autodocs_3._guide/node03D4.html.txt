(V36) SYNOPSIS Screen = OpenScreenTagList( NewScreen , TagItems ) D0 A0 A1 struct Screen *OpenScreenTagList( struct NewScreen *, struct TagItem * ); Screen = OpenScreenTags( NewScreen , Tag1, ... ) struct Screen *OpenScreenTags( struct NewScreen *, ULONG, ... ); FUNCTION Provides an extension to the parameters passed to OpenScreen() . This extensions is in the form of (a pointer to) an array of TagItem structures, which have to fields: ti_Tag, an ID identifying the meaning of the other field, ti_Data. See . The tag items can supplement or override the values in NewScreen . In fact, you can pass a NULL value of the NewScreen pointer. For that matter, if you pass NULL in both arguments, you'll get a screen with defaults in all fields, including display mode, depth, colors, dimension, title, and so on. We ask that you at least supply a title when you open a screen. See OpenScreen() documentation for parameter specifications. INPUTS NewScreen - (optional) pointer to a NewScreen structure. TagItems - (optional) pointer to (an array of) TagItem structures, terminated by the value TAG_END. RESULT Screen - an open Intuition screen. See OpenScreen() for extended error codes when Screen is returned NULL. EXAMPLE The version using a variable number of arguments must be created for each particular compiler, and may not have an analogue in all versions. For vanilla, 32-bit C parameter passing conventions, this works (and will appear in amiga.lib): struct Screen * OpenScreenTags( ns, tag1 ) struct NewScreen *ns; ULONG tag1; { struct Screen *OpenScreenTagList(); return ( OpenScreenTagList( ns, (struct TagItem *) &tag1 ) ); } NOTES We recommend this extension to OpenScreen() over using the field ExtNewScreen.Extension. However, the ExtNewScreen.Extension is a convenient way to supply a few tags to V36 Intuition which will be ignored by V34 Intuition. See OpenScreen() documentation for lots of details. A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE about the Screen->BitMap. In the future, bitmaps will need to grow. The embedded instance of a bitmap in the screen will no longer be large enough to hold the whole description of the bitmap. YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED to use Screen->RastPort.BitMap in place of &Screen->BitMap whenever and whereever possible. BUGS SEE ALSO OpenScreen() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
