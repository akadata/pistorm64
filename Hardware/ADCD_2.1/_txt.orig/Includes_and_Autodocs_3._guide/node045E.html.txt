(V38) SYNOPSIS length = StrConvert(locale,string,buffer,bufferSize,type); D0 A0 A1 A2 D0 D1 ULONG StrConvert(struct Locale *, STRPTR , APTR ,ULONG,ULONG); FUNCTION This function transforms the passed string and places the resulting into the supplied buffer. No more than bufferSize bytes are copied into the buffer. The transformation is such that if the C strcmp() function is applied to two transformed strings, it returns a value corresponding to the result returned by the StrnCmp() function applied to the two original strings. INPUTS locale - the locale to use for the transformation string - NULL-terminated string to transform buffer - buffer where to put the transformed string bufferSize - maximum number of bytes to deposit in the buffer StrConvert() may require more storage than the unconverted string does type - describes how the transformation is to be performed. See the documentation on StrnCmp() for more information on the comparison types available RESULT length - length of the transformed string which is the number of bytes deposited in the buffer minus 1 (since strings are NULL- terminated) SEE ALSO StrnCmp() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
