27 / / The RastPort Structure / RastPort Write Mask ]" border=0> The write mask is a RastPort variable that determines which of the bitplanes are currently writable. For most applications, this variable is set to all bits on. This means that all bitplanes defined in the BitMap are affected by a graphics writing operation. You can selectively disable one or more bitplanes by simply specifying a 0 bit in that specific position in the control byte. For example: #include SetWrMsk(&rastPort, 0xFB); /* disable bitplane 2 */ A useful application for the Mask field is to set or clear plane 6 while in the Extra-Half-Brite display mode to create shadow effects. For example: SetWrMsk(&rastPort, 0xE0); /* Disable planes 1 through 5. */ SetAPen(&rastPort, 0); /* Clear the Extra-Half-Brite bit */ RectFill(&rastPort, 20, 20, 40, 30); /* in the old rectangle. */ SetAPen(&rastPort, 32); /* Set the Extra-Half-Brite bit */ RectFill(&rastPort, 30, 25, 50, 35); /* in the new rectangle. */ SetWrMsk(&rastPort, -1); /* Re-enable all planes. */ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
