3 / Other Screen Functions / Miscellaneous Screen Functions ]" border=0> Three other functions used with screens are DisplayBeep(), ShowTitle() and GetScreenData() . DisplayBeep() flashes the screen colors to inform the user of an error or problem. VOID DisplayBeep( struct Screen *myscreen ) Since not all users will have speakers attached to the system, DisplayBeep() can be used to provide a visible bell. DisplayBeep() can beep any single screen or, if myscreen is set to NULL, all screens. ShowTitle() determines whether the screen's title bar will be displayed in front of or behind any backdrop windows on the screen. VOID ShowTitle( struct Screen *myscreen, BOOL infront ) By default, the screen's title bar is set to display in front of backdrop windows. Call this function with infront set to FALSE to put the screen title bar behind backdrop windows. This can also be set when the screen is opened with the SA_ShowTitle tag. Under 1.3 (V34) and earlier versions of the Amiga OS, applications used the GetScreenData() to get a copy of the Workbench Screen structure in order to examine its attributes. success = BOOL GetScreenData( APTR buffer, UWORD bufsize, UWORD type, struct Screen *scr) If successful, GetScreenData() copies a given Screen structure to a buffer supplied by the application. A copy of the Workbench Screen data can be obtained without knowing its location in memory using GetScreenData(buf, sizeof(struct Screen), WBENCHSCREEN, NULL). However, for Release 2 and later versions of the operating system, this function may return some false information about the Workbench screen. This false screen information helps prevent older applications that used the call from malfunctioning when run in a Release 2 system that has Workbench set up with one of the newer modes. Applications that want to get information on the Workbench screen should use GetScreenData() when run under 1.3 and LockPubScreen() when run under under Release 2. For more about LockPubScreen() and Workbench , see the section on " Public Screen Functions " earlier in this chapter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
