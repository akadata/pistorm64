23 / List Functions / Insertion and Removal ]" border=0> The Insert() function is used for inserting a new node into any position in a list. It always inserts the node following a specified node that is already part of the list. For example, Insert( header , node ,pred) inserts the node node after the node pred in the specified list. If the pred node points to the list header or is NULL, the new node will be inserted at the head of the list. Similarly, if the pred node points to the lh_Tail of the list, the new node will be inserted at the tail of the list. However, both of these actions can be better accomplished with the functions mentioned in the " Special Case Insertion " section below. The Remove() function is used to remove a specified node from a list. For example, Remove( node ) will remove the specified node from whatever list it is in. To be removed, a node must actually be in a list. If you attempt to remove a node that is not in a list, you will cause serious system problems. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
