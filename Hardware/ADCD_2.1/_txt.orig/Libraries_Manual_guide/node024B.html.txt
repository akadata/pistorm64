Amiga® RKM Libraries: 15 GadTools Library ]" border=0> GadTools is a new library in Release 2 that is designed to simplify the task of creating user interfaces with Intuition. GadTools offers a flexible and varied selection of gadgets and menus to help programmers through what used to be a difficult chore. Intuition, the Amiga's graphical user interface, is a powerful and flexible environment. It allows a software designer a great degree of flexibility in creating dynamic and powerful user interfaces. However, the drawback of this flexibility is that programming even straightforward user interfaces can be complicated, and certainly difficult for first-time Intuition programmers. What the Gadget Toolkit (GadTools) attempts to do is harness the power of Intuition by providing easy-to-use, high-level chunks of user interface. GadTools doesn't pretend to answer all possible user interface needs of every application but by meeting the user interface needs of most applications, GadTools greatly simplifies the problem of designing user-friendly software on the Amiga. (For applications with special needs, custom solutions can be created with Intuition's already-familiar gadgets or its new Boopsi object-oriented custom gadget system; GadTools is compatible with these.)
