6 / Setting Up Menus / Menu Layout ]" border=0> The Amiga allows great flexibility in the specification of fonts for the display. Default fonts are chosen by the user to suit their particular requirements and display resolution. The application should, where possible, use one of the preferred fonts. If the application did not open its own screen and completely specify the font for that screen, it must perform dynamic menu layout. This is because the Menu structure does not specify font. The menu header always uses the screen font and the program should update the size and position of these items at runtime to reflect the font. The font for menu items may be specified in the MenuItem structure, allowing the programmer to hard code values for the font, size and position of these items. This is not recommended. A specific font, while ideal on one system, may be less than ideal on another display type. Use the preferred font wherever possible. If the application does its own menu layout, it must use great care to handle the font in the menu strip and the font in each item or sub-item. The code should also keep items from running off the edges of the screen. See the description of ItemFill in the section " MenuItem Structure " below for information on the positioning of multiple IntuiText or Image structures within the menu item. Applications should use the GadTools library menu layout routines whenever possible, rather than performing their own layout. See the chapter on the " GadTools Library " for more details.
