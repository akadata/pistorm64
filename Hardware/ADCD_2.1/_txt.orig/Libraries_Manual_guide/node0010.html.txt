1 / / Libraries of Functions / Another Kind of Function Library ]" border=0> The Amiga has two kinds of libraries: run-time libraries and link libraries. All the libraries discussed so far are run-time libraries. Run-time libraries make up most of the Amiga's operating system and are the main topic of this book. There is another type of library known as a link library. Even though a link library is a collection of functions just like a run-time library, there are some major differences in the two types. Run-time libraries A run-time, or shared library is a group of functions managed by Exec that resides either in ROM or on disk (in the LIBS: directory). A run-time library must be opened before it can be used (as explained above ). The functions in a run-time library are accessed dynamically at run-time and can be used by many programs at once even though only one copy of the library is in memory. A disk based run-time library is loaded into memory only if requested by a program and can be automatically flushed from memory when no longer needed. Link libraries A link library is a group of functions on disk that are managed by the compiler at link time. Link libraries do not have to be opened before they are used, instead you must link your code with the library when you compile a program. The functions in a link library are actually copied into every program that uses them. For instance the exit() function used in the C program listed above is not part of any of the libraries that make up the Amiga OS. It comes from the link library supplied with the compiler (lc.lib for SAS/Lattice C or c.lib for Manx Aztec C). The code that performs the exit() function is copied into the program when it is compiled. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
