B / rootclass / New Methods: OM_UPDATE ]" border=0> This method tells an object to update one or more of its attributes. No application should call this method. Only Boopsi objects send OM_UPDATE messages. The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. A Boopsi object uses an OM_UPDATE message to notify another Boopsi object about transitory changes to one or more attributes. From the point of view of most objects, an OM_UPDATE message is almost identical to OM_SET . Because the methods are so similar, When a typical dispatcher receives an OM_UPDATE message, it processes the OM_UPDATE the same way it would process an OM_SET message, usually using the same code. There are actually two kinds of OM_UPDATE, an interim and final one. While a Boopsi object's attribute is in a transient state, it can send out interim OM_UPDATE messages to its target(s). For example, while the user is sliding a Boopsi prop gadget, the prop gadget sends interim OM_UPDATE message about changes to its PGA_Top value (the integer value of the prop gadget is the PGA_Top attribute) to some target object. When the user lets go of the prop gadget, the gadget is no longer in a transient state, so the gadget sends out a final OM_UPDATE about its PGA_Top attribute. The target object can choose to change one of its attributes based on the OM_UPDATE messages it receives. The layout of the OM_UPDATE message is almost identical to the OM_SET message: struct opUpdate { /* the OM_NOTIFY method also uses this structure */ ULONG MethodID; /* OM_UPDATE */ struct TagItem *opu_AttrList; /* tag list of attributes */ struct GadgetInfo *opu_GInfo; /* that changed. */ ULONG opu_Flags; /* The extra field */ }; #define OPUF_INTERIM (1 [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
