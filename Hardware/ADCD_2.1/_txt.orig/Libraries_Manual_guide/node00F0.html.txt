3 / Overscan and the Display Clip / Preset Overscan Values ]" border=0> Four preset overscan dimensions are provided. Applications that support overscan should use these preset values where possible since they will be tailored to each individual system. Avoid using custom values that happen to look good on a specific system. However, be aware that the size and positioning of overscan screens can be different on every system depending on how the user has set Overscan Preferences. These preset values are also dependent on the underlying display mode so keep in mind that both offset and size parameters will change under different screen modes. Overscan presets can be used, among other things, with the SA_Overscan tag to set the size of the screen's display clip or passed as an argument to QueryOverscan() to find their current overscan settings. OSCAN_TEXT This overscan region is based on user preference settings and indicates a display that is completely within the visible bounds of the monitor. The View origin is set to the upper left corner of the text overscan rectangle which is the highest leftmost point known to be visible on the physical display. This position is set by the user through the Overscan Preferences editor. All screen positions and display clips are relative to this origin. OSCAN_STANDARD The edges of OSCAN_STANDARD display are also based on user preferences and are set to be just outside the visible bounds of the monitor. OSCAN_STANDARD provides the smallest possible display that will fill the entire screen with no border around it. Parts of the display created with OSCAN_STANDARD may not be visible to the user. OSCAN_MAX Create the largest display fully supported by Intuition and the graphics library. This is the largest size for which all enclosed sizes and positions are legal. Parts of the display created with OSCAN_MAX may not be visible to the user. OSCAN_VIDEO Create the largest display, restricted by the hardware. This is the only legal size and position that is possibly (but not necessarily) larger than OSCAN_MAX. You must use the exact size and position specified. OSCAN_VIDEO does not support variable left edge, top edge positioning. Parts of the display created with OSCAN_VIDEO may not be visible to the user. If custom clipping is required, a display clip may be explicitly specified using the SA_DClip tag and a Rectangle structure specification. This custom rectangle must fit within the OSCAN_MAX rectangle, offset included. It is not permitted to specify custom rectangles whose values are in between OSCAN_MAX and OSCAN_VIDEO, nor is it permitted to specify rectangles larger than OSCAN_VIDEO. For an example of how to open a centered overscan screen based on user preferences, see the module/ screen.c listing in the IFF Appendix of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices. Use the Graphics library call VideoControl() to find the true display clip of a screen. See the Graphics Autodocs and the chapter " Graphics Primitives " for more information on VideoControl(). The ViewPortExtra structure contains the display clip information. If any dimension of a screen is not equal to the equivalent display clip dimension, then the screen may be scrolled. If the screen's dimensions are smaller than the display clip, then the screen may be positioned within the display clip. If the screen is larger than the display clip, then it may be positioned such that any part of the screen is visible. AutoScroll may be activated by setting the tag SA_AutoScroll . Screens will only scroll when they are the active screen. Activate a window in the screen to make the screen active. About the Default Display Clip. ------------------------------- The default display clip for a screen is the entire screen, that is, the rectangle starting from the upper left corner of the screen and ending at the lower right corner of the screen. This display clip is only used if the application does not specify SA_Overscan or SA_DClip . When using this default display clip the screen will not scroll as the screen exactly fits into the clipping region. When opening a window in an overscanned screen, it is often useful to open it relative to the visible part of the screen rather than relative to the entire screen. Use QueryOverscan() to find the overscan region and where the screen is positioned relative to it. LONG QueryOverscan(ULONG displayID, struct Rectangle *rect, WORD overscanType ) This example was taken from the chapter "Intuition Windows" in the section " A Display Sized Window Example ". The complete example is reproduced there. /* this technique returns the text overscan rectangle of the screen that ** we are opening on. If you really need the actual value set into the ** display clip of the screen, use the VideoControl() command of the ** graphics library to return a copy of the ViewPortExtra structure.
