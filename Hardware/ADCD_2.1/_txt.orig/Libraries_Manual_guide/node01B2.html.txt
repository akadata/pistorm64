7 / Alerts / Types of Alerts ]" border=0> There are two levels of severity for alerts: RECOVERY_ALERT Recovery alerts are used in situations where the caller believes that the system can resume operations after handling the error. The alert is used as a warning, and is displayed in amber. A recoverable alert displays the text of the alert and flashes the border while waiting for the user to respond. It returns TRUE if the user presses the left mouse button in response to the alert, otherwise FALSE is returned. DEADEND_ALERT Deadend alerts are used in situations where the caller believes that no recovery from the error is possible, and further operation of the system is impossible. This alert is used to inform the user of a fatal problem and is displayed in red. Deadend alerts are the same as recoverable alerts in every way except color. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
