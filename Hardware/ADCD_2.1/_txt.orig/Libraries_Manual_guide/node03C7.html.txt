28 / / Specifying Animation Object / Setting Up Simple Motion Control ]" border=0> In this form of animation, you can specify objects that have independently controllable velocities and accelerations in the X and Y directions. Components can still sequence. The variables that control this motion are located in the AnimOb structure and are called: * YVel, XVel --the velocities in the y and x directions. These values are added to the position values on each call to Animate() ( see below ). * YAccel, XAccel --the accelerations in the xa nd y directions. These values are added to the velocity values on each call to Animate() ( see below ). The velocity values are updated before the position values. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
