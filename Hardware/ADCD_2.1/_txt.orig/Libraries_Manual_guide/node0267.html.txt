15 / / The Kinds of GadTools Gadgets / Listview Gadgets ]" border=0> Listview gadgets (LISTVIEW_KIND) are scrolling lists. They consist of a scroller with arrows, an area where the list itself is visible and optionally a place where the current selection is displayed, which may be editable. The user can browse through the list using the scroller or its arrows and may select an entry by clicking on that item. There are a number of tags that are used with listviews: GTLV_Labels (struct List *) An Exec list whose nodes' ln_Name fields are to be displayed as items in the scrolling list. If the list is empty, an empty List structure or a NULL value may be used for GTLV_Labels. This tag accepts a value of "~0" to detach the list from the listview, defined below. The default is NULL. (Create and set.) GTLV_Top (UWORD) The ordinal number of the top item visible in the listview. The default is zero. (Create and set.) GTLV_ReadOnly (BOOL) Set this to TRUE for a read-only listview, which the user can browse, but not select items from. A read-only listview can be recognized because the list area is recessed, not raised. The default is FALSE. (Create only.) GTLV_ScrollWidth (UWORD) The width of the scroller to be used in the listview. Any value specified must be reasonably bigger than zero. The default is 16. (Create only.) GTLV_ShowSelected (struct Gadget *) Use this tag to show the currently selected entry displayed underneath the listview. Set its value to NULL to get a read-only ( TEXT_KIND ) display of the currently selected entry or set it to a pointer to an already-created GadTools STRING_KIND gadget to allow the user to directly edit the current entry. By default, there is no display of the currently selected entry. (Create only.) GTLV_Selected (UWORD) Ordinal number of the item to be placed into the display of the current selection under the listview. This tag is ignored if GTLV_ShowSelected is not used. Set it to "~0" to have no current selection. The default is "~0". (Create and set.) LAYOUTA_Spacing (UWORD) Extra space, in pixels, to be placed between the entries in the listview. The default is zero. (Create only.) The program will only hear from a listview when the user selects an item from the list. The program will then receive an IDCMP_GADGETUP IntuiMessage . This message will contain the ordinal number of the item within the list that was selected in the Code field of the message. This number is independent of the displayed listview, it is the offset from the start of the list of items. If the program attaches a display gadget by using the TagItem {GTLV_ShowSelected, NULL}, then whenever the user clicks on an entry in the listview it will be copied into the display gadget. If the display gadget is to be editable, then the program must first create a GadTools STRING_KIND gadget whose width matches the width of the listview. The TagItem {GTLV_ShowSelected, stringgad} is used to install the editable gadget, where stringgad is the pointer returned by CreateGadget() . When the user selects any entry from the listview, it gets copied into the string gadget. The user can edit the string and the program will hear normal string gadget IDCMP_GADGETUP messages from the STRING_KIND gadget. The Exec List and its Node structures may not be modified while they are attached to the listview, since the list might be needed at any time. If the program has prepared an entire new list, including a new List structure and all new nodes, it may replace the currently displayed list in a single step by calling GT_SetGadgetAttrs() with the TagItem {GTLV_Labels, newlist}. If the program needs to operate on the list that has already been passed to the listview, it should detach the list by setting the GTLV_Labels attribute to "~0". When done modifying the list, resubmit it by setting GTLV_Labels to once again point to it. This is better than first setting the labels to NULL and later back to the list, since setting GTLV_Labels to NULL will visually clear the listview. If the GTLV_Labels attribute is set to "~0", the program is expected to set it back to something determinate, either a list or NULL, soon after. The height specified for the listview will determine the number of lines in the list area. When creating a listview, it will be no bigger than the size specified in the NewGadget structure. The size will include the current-display gadget, if any, that has been requested via the GTLV_ShowSelected tag. The listview may end up being less tall than the application asked for, since the calculated height assumes an integral number of lines in the list area. By default, the gadget label will be placed above the listview. This may be overridden using ng_Flags . Currently, a listview may not be disabled. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
