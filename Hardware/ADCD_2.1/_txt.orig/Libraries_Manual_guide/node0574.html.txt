E / Additional Information / Task Switching ]" border=0> The 1.3 Kickstart contained two task switching bugs. After an interrupt, a task could lose the CPU to another equal priority task, even if the first task's time was not up. The second bug allowed a task whose time was up to hold on to the CPU either forever, or until a higher priority task was scheduled. Two busy-waiting tasks at high priority would never share the CPU. Because the input.device runs at priority 20, usually the effect of these bugs was masked out for low priority tasks. The ExecBase->Quantum field had little effect because of the bugs. For 2.0, a task runs until either its Quantum is up, or a higher priority task preempts it. When the Quantum time is up, the task will now lose the CPU. The Quantum was set to 16/60 second for 1.3, and 4/60 second for 2.0. In general, the 2.0 change makes the system more efficient by eliminating unnecessary task switches on interrupt-busy systems (for example, during serial input). However, the change has caused problems for some programs that use two tasks of equal priority, one busy-waiting and one Wait() ing on events such as serial input. Previously, each incoming serial character interrupt would cause task context switch allowing the event-handling task to run immediately. Under 2.0 the two tasks share the processor fairly.
