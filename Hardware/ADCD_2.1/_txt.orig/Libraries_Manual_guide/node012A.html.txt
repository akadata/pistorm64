4 / Other Window Functions / Changing the Window or Screen Title ]" border=0> Each window has its own window title and local screen title. The window title, if specified, is always displayed in the window. The local screen title, if specified, is only displayed in the screen's title bar when the window is active. If the window does not specify a local screen title, then the default screen title is used in the screen title bar when this window is active. void SetWindowTitles( struct Window *window, UBYTE *windowTitle, UBYTE *screenTitle ); This function changes the window title or local screen title for the given window. Both windowTitle and screenTitle can be set to -1, NULL or a NULL terminated string. Specifying -1 will not change the title from the current value. Specifying NULL will clear the window title or reset the screen title to the default title for the screen. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
