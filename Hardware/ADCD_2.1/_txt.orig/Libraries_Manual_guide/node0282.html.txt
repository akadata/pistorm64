16 / Creating a Font Requester / Specifying Options with TagItems ]" border=0> As with a file requester, the font requester is specified with a TagItem list. There are several tags that are specific to the font requester: Font Requester Tag Name Used For -------------- -------- ASL_FontName Default font ( fo_Attr .ta_Name) ASL_FontHeight Default font size ( fo_Attr .ta_YSize) ASL_FontStyles Default font style ( fo_Attr .ta_Style) ASL_FontFlags Default font flags ( fo_Attr .ta_Flags) ASL_FrontPen Default font color ( fo_FrontPen ) ASL_BackPen Default font background color ( fo_BackPen ) ASL_ModeList Alternate strings for the drawing mode gadget (see below) ASL_MinHeight Minimum font height the requester will display ASL_MaxHeight Maximum font height the requester will display Note that the last two tags only limit the range of font sizes that the font requester displays, the user is free to type in any value. Font requesters have additional special options that are controlled through the ASL_FuncFlags tag. This tag works the same way as it does with file requesters but with different options available. Recall that the data for this tag is divided into bit fields, each of which controls a requester option. The flags used with the ASL_FuncFlags tag in a font requester are defined in asl.h >: Font Requester Flags Used For -------------------- -------- FONF_FRONTCOLOR Enables font color selection gadgets FONF_BACKCOLOR Enables font background color selection gadget FONF_STYLES Enables font style selection gadget FONF_FIXEDWIDTH Limits display to fixed width fonts only FONF_DRAWMODE Enables font draw mode gadget A simple font requester (one without any of the above FONF_ flags set) only lets the user choose a font and a Y size. Setting the flags above adds options to the font requester. FONF_FRONTCOLOR and FONF_BACKCOLOR add color selection gadgets to the requester, one for choosing a font's foreground color (labeled "Text") and the other for choosing the background color (labeled "Field"). The font requester records the user's setting in the FontRequester 's fo_FrontPen and fo_BackPen fields. FONF_STYLES sets up several gadgets to choose the style of the font (bold, italics, underline). The font requester saves these settings in the fo_Attr .ta_Style bit field according to the style flags defined in text.h >. FONF_FIXEDWIDTH limits the font name display to fixed width (non-proportional) fonts (note that this does not prevent the user from typing in a proportional font name). FONF_DRAWMODE adds a cycle gadget to the font requester so the user can choose the draw mode. The draw mode is saved in the requester's fo_DrawMode field. The number stored there corresponds to the draw mode's position in the gadget's cycle. The draw mode cycle gadget initially is labeled "Mode" and has three elements in its cycle: "JAM1", "JAM2", and "Complement". These yield a result of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. It is possible to change the names and number of draw modes with the ASL_ModeList tag. This tag accepts a pointer to an array of strings. The first string replaces "Mode" as the label for the draw mode cycle gadget. The strings that follow replace the elements of the cycle gadget. The last entry in the array has to be NULL to tell the requester where the list of entries ends. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
