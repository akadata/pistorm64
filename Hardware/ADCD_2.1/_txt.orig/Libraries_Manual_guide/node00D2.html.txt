A menu is a list of choices displayed at the top of the screen from which the user can select with the mouse. Each screen has one menu bar that all application windows operating on the screen share. Whichever window is active controls what appears in the menu bar . Figure 2-4: An Intuition Menu The current set of menu choices can always be brought into view by pressing the right mouse button (the menu button) thus providing the user with a familiar landmark even in unfamiliar applications. Menus allow the user to browse through the possible set of actions that can be performed giving an outline-like overview of the functions offered by a program. Menus are discussed in detail in Chapter 6, " Intuition Menus ". Additional information on programming menus for Release 2 of the operating system can be found in Chapter 15, " GadTools Library ".
