28 / / The Bob Structure / Linking Bob and VSprite Structures ]" border=0> The VSprite and Bob structures must point to one another, so that the system can find the entire GEL. The structures are linked with statements like this: myBob.BobVSprite = &myVSprite; myVSprite.VSBob = &myBob; Now the system (and the application program) can go back and forth between the two structures to obtain the various Bob variables.
