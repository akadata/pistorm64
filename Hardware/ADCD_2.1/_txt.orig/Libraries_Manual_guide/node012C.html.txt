4 / Other Window Functions / Changing Pointer Position Reports ]" border=0> Pointer position messages to a window may be turned on and off by simply setting or clearing the WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag bit in Window->Flags , in an atomic way, as explained for the WA_RMBTrap tag in the "Window Attributes" section above. Using this direct method of setting the flag avoids the historic confusion on the ordering of the arguments of the ReportMouse() function call. Mouse reporting may be turned on even if mouse movements were not activated when the window was opened. The proper IDCMP flags must be set for the window to receive the messages. See the chapter " Intuition Mouse and Keyboard " for more details on enabling mouse reporting in an application. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
