6 / / Intercepting Normal Menu Operations / Menu Verify ]" border=0> Menu verify is one of the Intuition verification capabilities that allow an application to ensure that it is prepared for some action taken by Intuition before that action takes place. Through menu verify, Intuition allows all windows in a screen to verify that they are prepared for menu operations before the operations begin. In general, use menu verify if the program is doing something special to the display of a custom screen, and needs to be sure the operation has completed before menus are rendered. Any window can access the menu verify feature by setting the IDCMP_MENUVERIFY flag with the WA_IDCMP tag when opening the window. When menus are activated in a screen which contains at least one window with IDCMP_MENUVERFIY set, menu operations will not proceed until all windows with the menu verify flag set reply to the notification or until the last message times out. The specific menu verify protocol is described below. In any case, it is vital that the application know when menu operations terminate, for only then does it have control of the screen again. For the active window, this is typically detected by watching for an IDCMP_MENUPICK message. If the program cancels the menu operations (MENUCANCEL), then it will instead receive an IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS message with code equal to MENUUP. Inactive windows will always receive IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS message with code equal to MENUUP. The active window is given special menu verify treatment. It receives the menu verify message before any other window and has the option of canceling menu operations altogether. This could be used, for instance, to examine where the user has positioned the mouse when the right button was pressed. For example, the application may choose to allow normal menu operations to proceed only when the pointer is in the menu bar area. When the pointer is below the menu bar, then the application can choose to interpret the menu verify message as a right button event for some non-menu purpose. The program can tell if it is the active window for the verify event by examining the Code field of the IDCMP_MENUVERIFY message. If the Code field is equal to MENUWAITING, this window is not active and Intuition is simply waiting for verification that menu operations may continue. However, if the Code field is equal to MENUHOT, this window is active and it determines if menu operations should proceed. If it wishes menu operations to proceed, the active window should reply to the IDCMP_MENUVERIFY message without changing any values. To cancel the menu operation, change the code field of the message to MENUCANCEL before replying to the message. When the active window cancels the menu operation it will be sent an IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS message with code equal to MENUUP. In general, the window will not then receive an IDCMP_MENUPICK event as it cancelled the operation. However, the system should be prepared to handle an IDCMP_MENUPICK message with code equal to MENUNULL as one may be sent if the user releases the mouse button before the window replies to the message. The system takes no action on screen until the active window either replies to the menu verify event or the event times out. If the active window replies to the event in time and does not cancel the menu operation, Intuition will then move the screen title bar layer to the front, display the menu strip and notify all inactive menu verify windows of the operation. Layers will not be locked and the actual menus will not be swapped in until all these inactive windows reply to the message or time out. The inactive windows may not cancel the menu operation. If the user releases the menu button before the active window replies to the menu verify message, the menu operation will be cancelled and the active window will be sent an IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS message with code equal to MENUUP. When the active window finally replies to the message, it will receive an IDCMP_MENUPICK message with code equal to MENUNULL . If the event times out before the active window replies to the message, it will immediately be sent an IDCMP_MENUPICK message with code equal to MENUNULL . Then, when the user releases the menu button, the program will receive an IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS message with code equal to MENUUP. If an inactive window receives an IDCMP_MENUVERIFY message, it will always receive an IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS message with code equal to MENUUP when the menu operations are completed. About Double-Menu Requesters. ----------------------------- The processing described above becomes more complicated when double-menu requester processing is introduced. If an application chooses to use a double-menu requester in a window with IDCMP_MENUVERIFY set, it should be aware that odd message combinations are possible. For instance, it is possible to receive only an IDCMP_MENUVERIFY event with no following IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS event or IDCMP_MENUPICK event. Applications should avoid using double menu requesters if possible. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
