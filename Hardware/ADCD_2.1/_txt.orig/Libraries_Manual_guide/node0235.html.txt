13 / Preferences in Release 2 / Other File Formats in Release 2 ]" border=0> Not every Preferences file is stored as an IFF file of type PREF. The palette.ilbm and pointer.ilbm files contain a regular ILBM FORM to store their imagery. The win.pat and wb.pat files use a raw format with 16 bytes reserved, followed by a WORD giving the total size of the pattern, a WORD giving the bitplane count, and byte arrays (currently 32 bytes) for each bitplane. The format of the wbconfig.prefs file is private. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
