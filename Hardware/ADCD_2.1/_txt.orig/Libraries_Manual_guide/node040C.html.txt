31 Commodities Exchange Library / Uniqueness ]" border=0> When a commodity opens its broker , it can ask Commodities Exchange not to launch another broker with the same name ( nb_Name ). The purpose of the uniqueness feature is to prevent the user from starting duplicate commodities. If a commodity asks, Commodities Exchange will not only refuse to create a new, similarly named broker, but it will also notify the original commodity if someone tries to do so. A commodity tells Commodities Exchange not to allow duplicates by setting certain bits in the nb_Unique field of the NewBroker structure it sends to CxBroker() : NBU_UNIQUE bit 0 NBU_NOTIFY bit 1 Setting the NBU_UNIQUE bit prevents duplicate commodities. Setting the NBU_NOTIFY bit tells Commodities Exchange to notify a commodity if an attempt was made to launch a duplicate. Such a commodity will receive a CXM_COMMAND CxMessage with an ID of CXCMD_UNIQUE when someone tries to duplicate it. Because the uniqueness feature uses the name a programmer gives a commodity to differentiate it from other commodities, it is possible for completely different commodities to share the same name, preventing the two from coexisting. For this reason, a commodity should not use a name that is likely to be in use by other commodities (like "filter" or "hotkey"). Instead, use a name that matches the commodity name. When HotKey.c gets a CXCMD_UNIQUE CxMessage , it shuts itself down. HotKey.c and all the windowless commodities that come with the Release 2 Workbench shut themselves down when they get a CXCMD_UNIQUE CxMessage. Because the user will expect all windowless commodities to work this way, all windowless commodities should follow this standard. When the user tries to launch a duplicate of a system commodity that has a window, the system commodity moves its window to the front of the display, as if the user had clicked the "Show" gadget in the controller program's window. A windowed commodity should mimic conventions set by existing windowed system commodities, and move its window to the front of the display. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
