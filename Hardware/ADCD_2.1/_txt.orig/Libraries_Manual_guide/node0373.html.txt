28 / / Types Of GELs / VSprites ]" border=0> The VSprite, or virtual sprite, is the simplest type of GEL. The VSprite data structure contains just a bit more information than is needed to define a hardware sprite. VSprites take advantage of the system's ability to reuse sprite DMA channels--each VSprite can be temporarily assigned to a hardware sprite, as needed. This makes it appear to an application program that it has a virtually unlimited supply of VSprites. Since VSprites are based on hardware sprites, rules that apply to hardware sprites apply to VSprites too. VSprites are not rendered into the underlying BitMap of the playfield and so do not affect any bits in the BitMap. Because they are hardware based, they are positioned at absolute display coordinates and are not affected by the movement of screens. The starting position of a sprite must not occur before scanline 20, because of certain hardware DMA time constraints. VSprites have the same size limitations as hardware sprites, they are 16-bits wide and arbitrarily tall. The VSprite data structure also serves as the root structure of more complex GEL types--Bobs and AnimComps. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
