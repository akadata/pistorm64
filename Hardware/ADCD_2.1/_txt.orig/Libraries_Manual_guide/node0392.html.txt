28 / VSprite Advanced Topics / Reserving Hardware Sprites ]" border=0> To prevent the VSprite system from using specific hardware sprites, set the sprRsrvd member of the GelsInfo structure. The pointer to the GelsInfo structure is contained in the RastPort structure. If all of the bits of this 8-bit value are ones (0xFF), then all of the hardware sprites may be used by the VSprite system. If any of the bits is a 0, the sprite corresponding to that bit will not be utilized by VSprites. Reserving Can Cause Problems. ----------------------------- Reserving sprites increases the likelihood of the system not being able to display a VSprite ( VSOVERFLOW ). See the next section, " How VSprites are Assigned ," for further details on this topic. You reserve a sprite by setting its corresponding bit in sprRsrvd. For instance, to reserve sprite zero only, set sprRsrvd to 0x01. To reserve sprite three only, set sprRsrvd to 0x08. If a hardware sprite is reserved, the system will not consider it when it makes VSprite assignments. Remember, hardware sprite pairs share color register sets. If a hardware sprite is reserved, its mate should probably be reserved too, otherwise the reserved sprite's colors will change as the unreserved mate is assigned different VSprites. For example, it is common practice to reserve Sprites 0 and 1, so that the Intuition pointer (Sprite 0) is left alone. This could be accomplished with the following statements: struct RastPort myRastPort = {0}; /* the View structure is defined */ myRastPort.GelsInfo->sprRsrvd = 0x03; /* reserve 0 and 1 */ The GfxBase structure may be examined to find which sprites are already in use. This may, at your option, impact what sprites you reserve. If Intuition is running, sprite 0 will already be in use as its pointer. The reserved sprite status is accessible as currentreserved = GfxBase->SpriteReserved; The next section presents a few trouble-shooting techniques for VSprite assignment.
