29 Graphics Library and Text / How an Amiga Font Structured in Memory? ]" border=0> So far, this chapter has concentrated on using library functions to render text, letting the system worry about the layout of the underlying font data. As far as the OS representation of a loaded font is concerned, outline fonts and normal bitmap fonts are structured identically. Color fonts have some extras information associated with them and are discussed a little later. Every loaded font, including color fonts, has a TextFont structure associated with them: struct TextFont { struct Message tf_Message; /* reply message for font removal */ UWORD tf_YSize; UBYTE tf_Style; UBYTE tf_Flags; UWORD tf_XSize; UWORD tf_Baseline; UWORD tf_BoldSmear; /* smear to affect a bold enhancement */ UWORD tf_Accessors; UBYTE tf_LoChar; UBYTE tf_HiChar; APTR tf_CharData; /* the bit character data */ UWORD tf_Modulo; /* the row modulo for the strike font data */ APTR tf_CharLoc; /* ptr to location data for the strike font */ /* 2 words: bit offset then size */ APTR tf_CharSpace; /* ptr to words of proportional spacing data */ APTR tf_CharKern; /* ptr to words of kerning data */ }; The first field in this structure is a Message structure. The node in this Message structure is what the OS uses to link together the fonts in the system list. From this node, an application can extract a font's name. The other fields in the TextFont structure are as follows: tf_YSize The maximum height of this font in pixels. tf_Style The style bits for this particular font, which are defined in text.h >. These include the same style bits that were mentioned in the discussion of the TextAttr structure in the " Choosing the Font " section of this chapter. In addition to those bits, there is also the FSF_COLORFONT bit, which identifies this as a special kind of TextFont structure called a ColorTextFont structure. This is discussed later in this chapter. tf_Flags The flags for this font, which were mentioned along with the style bits in the section, " Choosing the Font ". tf_XSize If this font is monospaced (non-proportional), tf_XSize is the width of each character. The width includes the extra space needed to the left and right of the character to keep the characters from running together. tf_Baseline The distance in pixels from the top line of the font to the baseline. tf_BoldSmear When algorithmically bolding, the Amiga currently "smears" a glyph by rendering it, moving over tf_BoldSmear number of pixels, and rerendering the glyph. tf_Accessors The number of currently open instances of this font (like the open count for libraries). tf_LoChar This is the first character glyph (the graphical symbol associated with this font) defined in this font. All characters that have ASCII values below this value do not have an associated glyph. tf_HiChar This is the last character glyph defined in this font. All characters that have ASCII values above this value do not have an associated glyph. An application can use these values to avoid rendering characters which have no associated glyphs. Any characters without an associated glyph will have the default glyph associated to them. Normally, the default glyph is a rectangle. tf_CharData This is the address of the bitmap from which the OS extracts the font's glyphs. The individual glyphs are bit-packed together. The individual bitmaps of the glyphs are placed in ASCII order side by side, left to right. The last glyph is the default glyph. The following is what the bitmap of the suits-8 font example looks like ( suits8 is the complete, disk-based bitmap font example used later in this chapter): .@@@...@@@......@........@.......@@@....@@@@@@@@@@@@............ @@@@@.@@@@@...@@@@@.....@@@.....@@@@@...@@........@@............ .@@@@@@@@@..@@@@@@@@@..@@@@@..@@..@..@@.@@........@@............ ..@@@@@@@..@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@........@@............ ...@@@@@....@@@.@.@@@..@@@@@..@@..@..@@.@@........@@............ ....@@@.........@.......@@@.......@.....@@........@@............ .....@........@@@@@......@......@@@@@...@@@@@@@@@@@@............ ................................................................ This font is rather sparse, as it only has five glyphs. Most fonts at least have glyphs for each letter of the alphabet. In this example, each glyph represents a symbol for a suit in a standard deck of cards (from left to right: hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs). Notice that there is no space between the individual glyphs. The spacing information is kept in separate tables to reduce the amount of memory occupied by the font. tf_Modulo This is number of bytes the pointer must move to go from one line of a glyph to the next. This is the pixel width of the entire font bitmap divided by eight. Notice that the bitmap above does not stop after it gets to the end of the last glyph. It is padded with zero bits to the nearest WORD boundary. tf_CharLoc This is a pointer to the CharLoc, the character location table. This table tells the OS how far into the bitmap to look for a character and how many pixels to fetch from each row. The CharLoc table for the suits-8 font looks like this: $0000000B,$000B000B,$00160007,$001D000B,$0028000C Each of the five long words in this character location table corresponds to a glyph in Suits-8. Each long word is broken up into two word values. The first word is the offset in pixels from the left edge of the bitmap to the first column containing the corresponding glyph. The second word is the width in pixels of the corresponding glyph image in the bitmap (note, this is not the width of the actual glyph as the actual glyph will have some space on either side of it). For example, the diamond character (the third character) starts at offset $16 (22) and it is 7 pixels wide. tf_CharSpace This is a pointer to an array of WORDs containing the width of each glyph in the font. Each entry tells the OS how much to increment the current horizontal position (usually RastPort.cp_X ). For reverse path fonts, these values can be negative. tf_CharKern This is a pointer to an array of "kerning" values. As it is used here, the term "kerning" is unorthodox. On the Amiga, kerning refers to the number pixels to leave blank before rendering a glyph. The normal typographical definition of the word refers to the number of pixels to back up before rendering the current glyph and is usually associated with a specific pair of glyphs rather than one particular glyph. For each glyph the system renders, it has to do several things: 1) Get the value from the kerning table that corresponds to this glyph and begin the rendering that number of pixels to the right. 2) Find this glyph's bitmap using the CharLoc table and blit the glyph to the rastport. 3) If this is a proportional font, look in the spacing table and figure how many pixels to advance the rastport's horizontal position. For a monospaced font, the horizontal position advance comes from the TextFont's tf_XSize field. Under Release 2, when the system opens a new font, it creates an extension to the TextFont structure called the TextFontExtension . This extension is important because it contains a pointer to the font's tag list, which is where the system keeps the font's TA_DeviceDPI values. The TextFont's tf_Message.mn_ReplyPort field contains a pointer to the TextFontExtension structure (the text.h > include file #defines tf_Message.mn_ReplyPort as tf_Extension). The only field of interest in the TextFontExtension structure is: struct TagItem *tfe_Tags; /* Text Tags for the font */ which points to the font's tag list. Before accessing the tag list, an application should make sure that this font has a corresponding TextFontExtension . The ExtendFont() function will return a value of TRUE if this font already has an extension or ExtendFont() was able to create an extension for this font. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
