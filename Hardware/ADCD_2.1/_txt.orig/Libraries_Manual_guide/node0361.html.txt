27 / / Performing Data Move Operations / Clearing a Memory Area ]" border=0> For memory that is accessible to the blitter (that is, internal Chip memory), the most efficient way to clear a range of memory is to use the blitter. You use the blitter to clear a block of memory with the statement: BltClear(memblock, bytecount, flags); The memblock argument is a pointer to the location of the first byte to be cleared and bytecount is the number of bytes to set to zero. In general the flags variable should be set to one to wait for the blitter operation to complete. Refer to the Amiga ROM Kernel Manual: Includes and Autodocs for other details about the flag argument. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
