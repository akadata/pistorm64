1 / / Design / DOS System(), CreateNewProc(), and CON: Enhancements ]" border=0> If your program currently uses the 1.3 AmigaDOS Execute() or CreateProc() functions, then it is definitely worth conditional code to use their V37 replacements when running under Release 2 . The System() function of Release 2 allows you to pass a command line to AmigaDOS as if it had been typed at a Shell window. System() can run synchronously with return values or asynchronously with automatic cleanup and it also sets up a proper stdio environment when passed a DOS filehandle for SYS_Input and NULL for SYS_Output. In combination with enhanced Release 2 CON: features, System() can provide a suitable execution environment on either Workbench or a custom screen. The CreateNewProc() function provides additional control and ease in process creation. CON: input and output in custom Intuition screens and windows is now supported. New options in the Release 2 console handler (CON:) provide the ability to open a CON: on any public Intuition screen, or to attach a CON: to an existing Intuition window. Additional options can add a close gadget or create an AUTO console window which will only open if accessed for read or write. Add conditional code to use these system-supported methods when running under Release 2 or later versions of the OS. Note that additional CON: option keywords can be easily removed under 1.3 at runtime by terminating the CON: string with NULL after the window title. Consult The AmigaDOS Manual by Bantam Books for additional information on Release 2 CON: and DOS features. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
