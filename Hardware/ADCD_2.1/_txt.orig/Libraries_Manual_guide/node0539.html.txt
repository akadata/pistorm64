D / Errors / CLI Error Message Problems ]" border=0> Improper error messages are caused by calling exit(n) with an invalid or missing return value n. Assembler programmers using startup code should jump to the startup code's _exit with a valid return value on the stack. Programs without startup code should return with a valid value in D0. Valid return values such as RETURN_OK, RETURN_WARN, RETURN_FAIL are defined in dos.h > and dos.i >. Values outside of these ranges (-1 for instance) can cause invalid CLI error messages such as "not an object module". Useful hint--if your program is called from a script, your valid return value can be conditionally branched on in the script (i.e., call program, then perform actions based on IF WARN or IF NOT WARN). RETURN_FAIL will cause the script to stop if a normal FAILAT value is being used in script. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
