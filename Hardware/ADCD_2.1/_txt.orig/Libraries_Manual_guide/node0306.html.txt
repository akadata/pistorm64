26 Exec Interrupts / Servicing Interrupts ]" border=0> Interrupts are serviced on the Amiga through the use of interrupt handlers and servers . An interrupt handler is a system routine that exclusively handles all processing related to a particular 4703 interrupt. An interrupt server is one of possibly many system routines that are invoked as the result of a single 4703 interrupt. Interrupt servers provide a means of interrupt sharing. This concept is useful for general-purpose interrupts such as vertical blanking. At system start, Exec designates certain interrupts as handlers and others as server chains. The PORTS , COPER , VERTB , EXTER , and NMI interrupts are initialized as server chains. Therefore, each of these may execute multiple interrupt routines per each interrupt. All other interrupts are designated as handlers and are always used exclusively. Interrupt Data Structure Interrupt Handlers Environment Interrupt Servers [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
