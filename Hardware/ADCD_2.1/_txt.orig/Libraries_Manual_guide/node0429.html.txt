33 / The Structure of IFF Files / Chunks: The Building Blocks of IFF ]" border=0> IFF files contain various types and amounts of data grouped in data chunks, each starting with a four-letter ASCII identifier (the chunk ID) followed by a 32-bit length count (the chunk size). The identifier and length count make it possible for IFF readers to skip over chunks that they don't understand or don't care about, and extract only the information they need. It may be helpful to think of these chunks as the building blocks of an IFF file (Figure 33-1). Figure 33-1: The Chunk - The Building Block of IFF ________________________ | | | `CKID' Size | |------------------------| | data data data data | | data data data data | | data data data ... | |________________________| The `CKID' (chunk ID) characters of a real chunk will be a four letter identifier such as `BODY' or `CMAP', specifying the type and format of data stored in the chunk. Most chunks contain a simple defined grouping of byte, word, and long variables similar to the contents of a C structure. Others such as sound sample and bitmap image body chunks, contain a stream of compressed data. Chunk writing is fairly straightforward with the one caveat that all chunks must be word-aligned. Therefore an odd-length chunk must be followed by a pad byte of zero (which is not counted in the size of the chunk). When chunks are nested, the enclosing chunk must state the total size of its composite contents (including any pad bytes). About Chunk Length. ------------------- Every IFF data chunk begins with a 4-character identifier field followed by a 32-bit size field (these 8 bytes are sometimes referred to as the chunk header). The size field is a count of the rest of the data bytes in the chunk, not including any pad byte. Hence, the total space occupied by a chunk is given by its size field (rounded to the nearest even number) + 8 bytes for the chunk header. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
