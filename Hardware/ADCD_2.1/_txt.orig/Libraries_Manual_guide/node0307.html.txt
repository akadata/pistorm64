26 / Servicing Interrupts / Interrupt Data Structure ]" border=0> Interrupt handlers and servers are defined by the Exec Interrupt structure. This structure specifies an interrupt routine entry point and data pointer. The C definition of this structure is as follows: struct Interrupt { struct Node is_Node; APTR is_Data; VOID (*is_Code)(); }; Once this structure has been properly initialized, it can be used for either a handler or a server.
