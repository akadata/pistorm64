25 / / The Signal Semaphore / Checking a SignalSemaphore ]" border=0> When you attempt to obtain a semaphore with ObtainSemaphore() , your task will be put to sleep if the semaphore is not currently available. If you do not want to wait, you can call AttemptSemaphore() instead. If the semaphore is available for exclusive locking , AttemptSemaphore() obtains it for you and returns TRUE. If it is not available, the function returns FALSE immediately instead of waiting for the semaphore to be released. To attempt to obtain a semaphore, use the following: struct SignalSemaphore *semaphore; AttemptSemaphore(semaphore); To make an attempt to obtain a public semaphore, the following code should be used: UBYTE *name; struct SignalSemaphore *semaphore; Forbid(); if (semaphore = FindSemaphore(name)) AttemptSemaphore(semaphore); Permit(); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
