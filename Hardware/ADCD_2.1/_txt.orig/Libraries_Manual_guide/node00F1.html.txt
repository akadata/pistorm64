3 Intuition Screens / Intuition Screens and the Graphics Library ]" border=0> As previously mentioned, an Intuition screen is related to a number of underlying graphics library structures. Table 3-8: Graphics Data Structures Used with Screens Structure Name Description Defined in Include File -------------- ----------- ----------------------- View Root structure of the view.h > graphics display system ViewPort The graphics structure that view.h > corresponds to a screen BitMap Contains size and pointers to gfx.h > the screen's bit planes ColorMap Contains size and pointer to view.h > the screen's color table RastPort Holds drawing, pen and font rastport.h > settings and the BitMap address These data structures are unified in Intuition's Screen structure (which also incorporates higher level Intuition constructs such as menus and windows). Here's a brief explanation of the graphics library structures used with Intuition. View The View is the graphics structure that corresponds to the whole display, including all visible screens. The system has just one View; it's what you see on the monitor. The address of the View may be obtained from any screen by using ViewAddress() . ViewPort The ViewPort is the underlying graphics structure corresponding to a screen. Every screen has one ViewPort. To get the address of the ViewPort from the Screen structure, use (&my_screen-> ViewPort). From the ViewPort an application may obtain pointers to all the screen's bitplanes and to its color table. BitMap The BitMap structure contains pointers to all the bit planes (up to 8) and their sizes. For future compatibility, use (my_screen->RastPort.BitMap) to get the address of the BitMap from the screen rather than (&my_screen->BitMap). The BitMap.BytesPerRow field specifies the number of bytes that have been allocated for each raster line. This may be larger than the screen width depending on display alignment restrictions. Alignment restrictions may change. Always use this variable, not a hard-coded value. ColorMap The ColorMap contains a pointer to the color table, an array of 32 WORDs for the hardware color registers. Use SetRGB4(), GetRGB4(), SetRGB4CM() and LoadRGB4() from the graphics library to access the color table. Do not read or write it directly. RastPort A RastPort controls the graphics rendering to any display area (not just screens). Screens have a RastPort to allow direct rendering into the screen. Applications may find the RastPort address of a screen with (&my_screen->RastPort). This generally is not useful since applications normally render into windows.
