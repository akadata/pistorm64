12 Boopsi--Object Oriented Intuition / Creating a Boopsi Class ]" border=0> So far this chapter has only hinted at what is possible with Boopsi. Its power lies in its extensibility. Boopsi grants the application programmer the power to add custom features to existing classes. If an existing class comes close to your needs, you can build on that class so it does exactly what you want. If you want a class that is unlike an existing class, you can create it. The heart of a Boopsi class is its method Dispatcher function. According to the OOP metaphor, when an application wants a Boopsi object to perform a method, it sends the object a message. In reality, that object is only a data structure, so it does not have the power to do anything. When an object receives a Boopsi message, a Boopsi message structure is passed to the dispatcher of that object's class. The dispatcher examines the message and figures out what to do about it. For example, when an application calls SetGadgetAttrs() on an integer gadget: SetGadgetAttrs(myintegergadget, mywindow, NULL, STRINGA_LongVal, 75L, GA_ID, 2L, TAG_END)); the SetGadgetAttrs() function calls the strgclass dispatcher. A Boopsi dispatcher receives three arguments: a pointer to the dispatcher's Class (defined in classes.h >), a pointer to the object that is going to perform the method, and a pointer to the Boopsi message. In this case, the SetGadgetAttrs() function builds an OM_SET message, finds the strgclass dispatcher, and "sends" the dispatcher the OM_SET message. SetGadgetAttrs() can find the dispatcher because an object contains a reference to its dispatcher. When the dispatcher function "gets" the message, it examines the message to find out its corresponding method. In this case, the dispatcher recognizes the message as an OM_SET message and proceeds to set myintegergadget's attributes. An OM_SET message looks like this (defined in classusr.h >): struct opSet { ULONG MethodID; /* This will be set to OM_SET */ struct TagItem *ops_AttrList; /* A tag list containing the */ /* attribute/value pairs of */ /* the attributes to set. */ struct GadgetInfo *ops_GInfo; /* Special information for gadgets */ } The OM_SET message contains a pointer to a tag list in ops_AttrList that looks like this: {STRINGA_LongVal, 75L}, {GA_ID, 2L}, {TAG_END,} The strgclass dispatcher scans through this tag list and recognizes the STRINGA_LongVal attribute. The dispatcher sets myintegergadget's internal STRINGA_LongVal value to the corresponding value (75L) from the attribute/value pair. The strgclass dispatcher continues to scan through the tag list. When it finds GA_ID , it does not process it like STRINGA_LongVal . The strgclass dispatcher's OM_SET method does not recognize the GA_ID attribute because strgclass inherited the GA_ID attribute from gadgetclass . To handle setting the GA_ID attribute, the strgclass dispatcher passes on the OM_SET message to its superclass's dispatcher. The strgclass dispatcher passes control to the gadgetclass dispatcher, which knows about the GA_ID attribute.
