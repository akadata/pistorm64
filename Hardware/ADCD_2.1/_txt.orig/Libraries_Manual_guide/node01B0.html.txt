7 / System Requesters / Redirecting System Requesters ]" border=0> A process can force the system requests which are caused by its actions to appear on a custom screen by changing the pr_WindowPtr field of its Process structure. This field may be set to three values: zero, negative one or a valid pointer to the Window structure of an open window. If pr_WindowPtr is set to zero, the request will appear on the default public screen. If pr_WindowPtr is set to negative one, the system request will never appear and the return code will be as if the user had selected the rightmost button (negative response). If pr_WindowPtr is set to a valid window pointer, then the request will appear on the same screen as the window. The original value of pr_WindowPtr should be cached and restored before the window is closed. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
