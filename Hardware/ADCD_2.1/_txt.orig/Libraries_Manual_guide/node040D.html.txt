31 Commodities Exchange Library / Signal CxObjects ]" border=0> A commodity can use a sender CxObject to find out if a CxMessage has "visited" a CxObject , but this method unnecessarily uses system resources. A commodity that is only interested in knowing if such a visitation took place does not need to see a corresponding input event or a CxMessage ID. Instead, Commodities Exchange has a CxObject that uses an Exec signal. signalCxObj = CxObj *CxSignal(struct Task *, LONG cx_signal); CxSignal() sets up a signal CxObject . When a signal CxObject receives a CxMessage , it signals a task. The commodity is responsible for determining the proper task ID and allocating the signal. Normally, a commodity wants to be signalled so it uses FindTask (NULL) to find it's own task address. Note that cx_signal from the above prototype is the signal number as returned by AllocSignal() , not the signal mask made from that number. For more information on signals, see the " Exec Signals " chapter. The example Divert.c (shown a little later in this chapter) uses a signal CxObject . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
