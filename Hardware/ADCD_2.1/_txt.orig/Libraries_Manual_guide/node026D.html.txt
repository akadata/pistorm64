15 / / Setting Up GadTools Menus and Gadgets / CreateContext() ]" border=0> Use of GadTools gadgets requires some per-window context information. CreateContext() establishes a place for that information to go. This function must be called before any GadTools gadgets are created. struct Gadget *CreateContext( struct Gadget **glistptr ); The glistptr argument is a double-pointer to a Gadget structure. More specifically, this is a pointer to a NULL-initialized pointer to a Gadget structure. The return value of CreateContext() is a pointer to this gadget, which should be fed to the program's first call to CreateGadget() . This pointer to the Gadget structure returned by CreateContext(), may then serve as a handle to the list of gadgets as they are created. The code fragment listed in the next section shows how to use CreateContext() together with CreateGadget() to make a linked list of GadTools gadgets. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
