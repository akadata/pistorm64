27 / / Performing Data Move Operations / Copying Rectangular Areas ]" border=0> Four routines use the blitter to copy rectangular areas from one section of a BitMap to another: BltBitMap() , BltBitMapRastPort() , BltMaskBitMapRastPort() , and ClipBlit() . All four of these blitter routines take a special argument called a minterm. The minterm variable is an unsigned byte value which represents an action to be performed during the move. Since all the blitter routines uses the hardware blitter to move the data, they can take advantage of the blitter's ability to logically combine or change the data as the move is made. The most common operation is a direct copy from source area to destination, which uses a minterm set to hex value C0. You can determine how to set the minterm variable by using the logic equations shown in the following tables. B represents data from the source rectangle and C represents data in the destination area. Table 27-7: Minterm Logic Equations Leftmost 4 Bits Logic Term Included of MinTermin Final Output ------------ ------------ 8 BC "B AND C" _ 4 BC "B AND NOT C" _ 2 BC "NOT B AND C" __ 1 BC "NOT B AND NOT C" You can combine values to select the logic terms. For instance a minterm value of 0xC0 selects the first two logic terms in the table above. These logic terms specify that in the final destination area you will have data that occurs in source B only. Thus, C0 means a direct copy. The logic equation for this is: _ _ BC + BC = B(C + C) = B Logic equations may be used to decide on a number of different ways of moving the data. For your convenience, a few of the most common ones are listed below. Table 27-8: Some Common MinTerm Values to Use for Copying MinTerm Value Logic Operation Performed During Copy ----- ------------------------------------- 30 Replace destination area with inverted source B. 50 Replace destination area with an inverted version of itself. 60 Put B where C is not, put C where B is not (cookie cut). 80 Only put bits into destination where there is a bit in the same position for both source and destination (sieve operation). C0 Plain vanilla copy from source B to destination C. The graphics library blitter routines all accept a minterm argument as described above. BltBitMap() is the basic blitter routine, moving data from one BitMap to another. BltBitMap() allows you to define a rectangle within a source BitMap and copy it to a destination area of the same size in another (or even the same) BitMap. This routine is used by the graphics library itself for rendering. BltBitMap() returns the number of planes actually involved in the blit. The syntax for the function is: ULONG planes; planes = BltBitMap(&srcBM, srcX, srcY, &dstBM, dstX, dstY, sizeX, sizeY, minterm, mask, tempA); The source bitmap is specified by the &srcBM argument. The position of the source area within the bitmap is specified by srcX and srcY. The destination bitmap is specified by the &dstBM argument. The position of the destination area within the bitmap is specified by dstX and dstY. The dimensions (in pixels) of the area to be moved is indicated by the sizeX and sizeY arguments. With the original custom chip set, the blitter size limits are 992 x 1024. With ECS the blitter size limits are 32,736 x 32,768. See the section on " Determining Chip Versions " earlier in this chapter to find out how to tell if the host system has ECS installed. The minterm argument determines what logical operation to perform on the rectangle data as bits are moved (described above). The mask argument, normally set to 0xff, specifies which bitplanes will be involved in the blit operation and which will be ignored. If a bit is set in the mask byte, the corresponding bitplane is included. The tempA argument applies only to blits that overlap and, if non-NULL, points to Chip memory the system will use for temporary storage during the blit. BltBitMapRastPort() takes most of the same arguments as BltBitMap() , but its destination is a RastPort instead of a BitMap . The syntax for the function is: VOID BltBitMapRastPort(&srcBM, srcX, srcY, &dstRP, dstX, dstY, sizeX, sizeY, minterm); The arguments here are the same as for BltBitMap() above. Note that the BltBitMapRastPort() function will respect the RastPort.Mask field. Only the planes specified in the Mask will be included in the operation. A third type of blitter operation is provided by the BltMaskBitMapRastPort() function. This works the same as BltBitMapRastPort() except that it takes one extra argument, a pointer to a single bitplane mask of the same height and width as the source. The mask acts as a filter for the operation--a blit only occurs where the mask plane is non-zero. The syntax for the function is: VOID BltMaskBitMapRastPort(&srcBM, srcX, srcY, &dstRP, dstX, dstY, sizeX, sizeY, minterm, bltmask); The bltmask argument points to a word-aligned mask bitplane in Chip memory with the same dimensions as the source bitmap. Note that this function ignores the Mask field of the destination RastPort . ClipBlit() takes most of the same arguments as the other blitter calls described above but it works with source and destination RastPort s and their layers. Before ClipBlit() moves data, it looks at the area from which and to which the data is being copied (RastPorts, not BitMap s) and determines if there are overlapping areas involved. If so, it splits up the overall operation into a number of bitmaps to move the data in the way you request. To call ClipBlit() use: VOID ClipBlit(&srcRP, srcX, srcY, &dstRP, dstX, dstY, XSize, YSize, minterm); Since ClipBlit() respects the Layer of the source and destination RastPort , it is the easiest blitter movement call to use with Intuition windows. The following code fragments show how to save and restore an undo buffer using ClipBlit(). /* Save work rastport to an undo rastport */ ClipBlit(&drawRP, 0, 0, &undoRP, 0, 0, areaWidth, areaHeight, 0xC0); /* restore undo rastport to work rastport */ ClipBlit(&undoRP, 0, 0, &drawRP, 0, 0, areaWidth, areaHeight, 0xC0); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
