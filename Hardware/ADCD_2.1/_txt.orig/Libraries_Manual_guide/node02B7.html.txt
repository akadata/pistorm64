20 / Other Memory Functions / Allocating Memory at an Absolute Address ]" border=0> For special advanced applications, AllocAbs() is provided. Using AllocAbs(), an application can allocate a memory block starting at a specified absolute memory address. If the memory is already allocated or if there is not enough memory available for the request, AllocAbs() returns a zero. Be aware that an absolute memory address which happens to be available on one Amiga may not be available on a machine with a different configuration or different operating system revision, or even on the same machine at a different times. For example, a piece of memory that is available during expansion board configuration might not be available at earlier or later times. Here is an example call to AllocAbs() : APTR absoluteptr; absoluteptr = (APTR)AllocAbs(10000, 0x2F0000); if (!(absoluteptr)) { /* Couldn't get memory, act accordingly. */ } /* After we're done using it, we call FreeMem() to free the memory */ /* block. */ FreeMem(absoluteptr, 10000); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
