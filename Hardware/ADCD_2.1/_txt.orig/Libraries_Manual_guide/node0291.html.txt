Amiga® RKM Libraries: 18 Exec Libraries ]" border=0> Exec maintains lists of libraries and devices. An Amiga library consists of a collection of related functions which can be anywhere in system memory (RAM or ROM). An Amiga device is very similar to an Amiga library, except that a device normally controls some sort of I/O hardware, and generally contains a limited set of standard functions which receive commands for controlling I/O. For more information on how to use devices for I/O, see the " Exec Device I/O " chapter of this book. Not for Beginners. ------------------ This chapter concentrates on the internal workings of Exec libraries (and devices). Most application programmers will not to know the internals workings of libraries to program the Amiga.
