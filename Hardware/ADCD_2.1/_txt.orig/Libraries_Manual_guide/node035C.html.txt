27 / / Using the Graphics Drawing Routines / Area-fill Operations ]" border=0> Assuming that you have properly initialized your RastPort structure to include a properly initialized AreaInfo , you can perform area fill by using the functions described in this section. AreaMove() tells the system to begin a new polygon, closing off any other polygon that may already be in process by connecting the end-point of the previous polygon to its starting point. AreaMove() is executed with the statement: LONG result; result = AreaMove(&rastPort, x, y); AreaMove() returns 0 if successful, -1 if there was no more space left in the vector list. AreaDraw() tells the system to add a new vertex to a list that it is building. No drawing takes place until AreaEnd() is executed. AreaDraw is executed with the statement: LONG result; result = AreaDraw(&rastPort, x, y); AreaDraw() returns 0 if successful, -1 if there was no more space left in the vector list. AreaEnd() tells the system to draw all of the defined shapes and fill them. When this function is executed, it obeys the drawing mode and uses the line pattern and area pattern specified in your RastPort to render the objects you have defined. To fill an area, you do not have to AreaDraw() back to the first point before calling AreaEnd() . AreaEnd() automatically closes the polygon. AreaEnd() is executed with the following statement: LONG result; result = AreaEnd(&rastPort); AreaEnd() returns 0 if successful, -1 if there was an error. To turn off the outline function, you have to set the RastPort Flags variable back to 0 with BNDRYOFF() : #include "graphics/gfxmacros.h" BNDRYOFF(&rastPort); Otherwise, every subsequent area-fill or rectangle-fill operation will outline their rendering with the outline pen ( AOlPen ).
