28 Graphics Sprites, Bobs and Animation / Using Virtual Sprites ]" border=0> This section describes how to set up the VSprite structure so that it represents a true VSprite. True VSprites are managed by the GELs system which converts them to Simple Sprites and displays them. (Later sections describe how a VSprite structure can be set up for Bobs and AnimComps.) Before the system is told of a VSprite's existence, space for the VSprite data structure must be allocated and initialized to correctly represent a VSprite. Since the system does no validity checking on the VSprite structure, the result of using a bogus structure is usually a fireworks display, followed by a system failure. The system software provides a way to detect collisions between VSprites and other on-screen objects. There is also a method of extending the VSprite structure to incorporate user defined variables. These subjects are applicable to all GELs and are explained later in the section on " Collisions and GEL Structure Extensions ".
