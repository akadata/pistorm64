21 / Processor and Cache Control / Condition Code Register ]" border=0> On the MC68000 a copy of the processor condition codes can be obtained with the MOVE SR, instruction. On MC68010 processors and up however, the instruction MOVE CCR, must be used. Using the specific MC68000 instruction on later processors will cause a 680x0 exception since it is a privileged instruction on those processors. The GetCC() function provides a processor independent way of obtaining a copy of the condition codes. For all processors there are 5 bits which can indicate the result of an integer or a system control instruction: X - extend N - negative Z - zero V - overflow C - carry The X bit is used for multiprecision calculations. If used, it is copy of the carry bit. The other bits state the result of a processor operation. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
