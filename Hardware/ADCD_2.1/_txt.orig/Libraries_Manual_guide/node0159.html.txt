The size of the container, like that of any other gadget select box, can be relative to the size of the window. The position of the container can be relative to any of the Intuition window's border. Clicking in the container around the knob will increment or decrement the value of the gadget (the pot variables ) by the appropriate amount (specified in the body variables ). The knob will move towards the point clicked when action is taken. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
