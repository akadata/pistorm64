11 Special Functions / Using Sprites in Intuition Windows and Screens ]" border=0> Sprite functionality has limitations under Intuition. The hardware and graphics library sprite systems manage sprites independently of the Intuition display. In particular: * Sprites cannot be attached to any particular screen. Instead, they always appear in front of every screen. * When a screen is moved, the sprites do not automatically move with it. The sprites move to their correct locations only when the appropriate function is called (either DrawGList() or MoveSprite() ). Hardware sprites are of limited use under the Intuition paradigm. They travel out of windows and out of screens, unlike all other Intuition mechanisms (except the Intuition pointer, which is meant to be global). Remember that sprite data must be in Chip memory to be accessible to the custom chips. This may be done with a compiler specific feature, such as the __chip keyword of SAS/C. Otherwise, Chip memory can be allocated with the Exec AllocMem() function or the Intuition AllocRemember() function, setting the memory requirement flag to MEMF_CHIP . The sprite data may then be copied to Chip memory using a function like CopyMem() in the Exec library. See the chapter " Graphics Sprites, Bobs and Animation " for more information.
