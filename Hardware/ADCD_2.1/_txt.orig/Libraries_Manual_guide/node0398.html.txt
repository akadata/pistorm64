28 / Using Bobs / The Bob Structure ]" border=0> The Bob structure is defined in the include file gels.h > as follows: struct Bob { WORD Flags; /* general purpose flags */ WORD *SaveBuffer;/* buffer for background save */ WORD *ImageShadow; /* shadow mask of image */ struct Bob *Before; /* draw this Bob before Bobs on this list */ struct Bob *After; /* draw this Bob after Bobs on this list */ struct VSprite *BobVSprite;/* this Bob's VSprite definition */ struct AnimComp *BobComp; /* pointer to this Bob's AnimComp def */ struct DBufPacket *DBuffer; /* pointer to this Bob's dBuf packet */ BUserStuff BUserExt; /* Bob user extension */ }; The Bob structure itself does not need to be in Chip memory. The (global) static declaration of a Bob structure could be done like so: struct Bob myBob = { 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0 }; However, since most of the Bob structure members are pointers, it is more common to allocate and set the Bob up dynamically. Refer to the makeBob() and freeBob() functions in the " animtools.c " example at the end of the chapter for an example of allocating, initializing and freeing a Bob structure.
