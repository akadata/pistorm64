5 Intuition Gadgets / Proportional Gadget Type ]" border=0> Proportional gadgets allow an application to get or display an amount, level, or position by moving a slidable knob within a track. They are called proportional gadgets because the size and position of the knob is proportional to some application-defined quantity, for example the size of a page, and how much and which part of the page is currently visible. An example of using proportional gadgets is available in the "Intuition Windows" chapter. The SuperBitMap window example, lines.c , uses proportional gadgets to control the position of the bitmap within the window. Proportional gadgets are made up of a container , which is the full size of the gadget, and a knob , that travels within the container. Changing the current value of the gadget is done by dragging the knob, or clicking in the container around the knob. Dragging the knob performs a smooth transition from one value to the next, while clicking in the container jumps to the next page or setting. The KNOBHIT flag in the PropInfo structure is available to allow the program to determine if the gadget was changed by dragging the knob or by clicking in the container. If the flag is set, the user changed the value by dragging the knob. Proportional gadgets allow display and control of fractional settings on the vertical axis, the horizontal axis or both. While the number of settings has a theoretical limit of 65,536 positions, the actual positioning of the gadget through sliding the knob is limited by the resolution of the screen. Further control is available by clicking in the container , although this often is not convenient for the user. Button or arrow gadgets are often provided for fine tuning of the setting of the gadget.
