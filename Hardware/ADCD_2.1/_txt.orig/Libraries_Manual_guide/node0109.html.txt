4 / / Window Dimensions / A Display Sized Window Example ]" border=0> A full screen window is not always desirable. If the user is working on a large, scrolling screen, they may only want a window the size of the visible display. The following example calculates the visible area on a screen and opens a window in that area. The example assumes that the screen display clip is as large or larger than text overscan (OSCAN_TEXT) which is set by the user. The window is opened in the text overscan area, not within the actual display clip that is used for the screen. Use QueryOverscan() to find the standard overscan rectangles (display clips) for a screen. Use the graphics library call VideoControl() to find the true display clip of the screen (see the chapter on " Graphics Primitives " for more information on VideoControl()). The ViewPortExtra structure contains the display clip information. About Screen Coordinates. ------------------------- The screen's actual position may not exactly equal the coordinates given in the LeftEdge and TopEdge fields of the Screen structure. This is due to hardware constraints that limit the fineness of the positioning of the underlying constructs. This may cause a window which is opened in the visible part of the screen to be incorrectly positioned by a small number of pixels in each direction. See the discussion of the screen's LeftEdge and TopEdge in the " Intuition Screens " chapter for more information. visiblewindow.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
