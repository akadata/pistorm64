33 IFFParse Library / The Structure of IFF Files ]" border=0> Many people have a misconception that IFF means image files. This is not the case. IFF (short for Interchange File Format) is a method of portably storing structured information in machine-readable form. The actual information can be anything, but the manner in which it is stored is very specifically detailed. This specification is the IFF standard. The IFF standard was originally designed in 1985 by Electronic Arts in conjunction with a committee of developers. The full standard along with file descriptions and sample code is published in the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices (3rd edition). The goal of the IFF standard is to allow customers to move their own data between independently developed software products. The types of data objects to exchange are open-ended and currently include plain and formatted text, raster and structured graphics, fonts, music, sound effects, musical instrument descriptions, and animation. IFF addresses these needs by defining a standard for self-identifying file structures and rules for accessing these files.
