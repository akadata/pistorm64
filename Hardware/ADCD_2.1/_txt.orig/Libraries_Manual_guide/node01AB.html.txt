7 Intuition Requesters and Alerts / Requester Structure ]" border=0> Unused fields in the Requester structure should be initialized to NULL or zero before using the structure. For global data that is pre-initialized, be sure to set all unused fields to zero. For dynamically allocated structures, allocate the storage with the MEMF_CLEAR flag, or call the InitRequester() function to clear the structure. Requesters are Initialized According to Their Type. --------------------------------------------------- See " Rendering Requesters " and " Gadgets in Requesters " above for information about how the initialization of the structure differs according to how the requester is rendered. The specification for a Requester structure, defined in intuition.h >, is as follows. struct Requester { struct Requester *OlderRequest; WORD LeftEdge, TopEdge; WORD Width, Height; WORD RelLeft, RelTop; struct Gadget *ReqGadget; struct Border *ReqBorder; struct IntuiText *ReqText; UWORD Flags; UBYTE BackFill; struct Layer *ReqLayer; UBYTE ReqPad1[32]; struct BitMap *ImageBMap; struct Window *RWindow; struct Image *ReqImage; UBYTE ReqPad2[32]; }; Here are the meanings of the fields in the Requester structure: OlderRequest For system use, initialize to NULL. LeftEdge, TopEdge The location of the requester relative to the upper left corner of the window. These values must be set if the POINTREL flag is not set. Use RelLeft and RelTop for POINTREL requesters. Width, Height These fields describe the size of the entire requester rectangle, containing all the text and gadgets. RelLeft, RelTop These values are only used if the POINTREL flag in the requester's Flags field is set. If the requester is a double menu requester and POINTREL is set then these values contain the relative offset of the requester's upper left corner from the current pointer position. If the requester is not a double menu requester and POINTREL is set, then these values contain the relative offset of the requester's center from the center of the window that the requester is to be displayed in. For example, using POINTREL with a requester which is not a double menu requester with RelLeft and RelTop of zero will center the requester in the window. The requester is centered within the inner part of the window, that is, within the inside edge of the window's borders. If the requester is POINTREL and part of the containing box will appear out of the window, Intuition will adjust the requester so that the upper left corner is visible and as much of the remaining box as possible is visible. The adjustment attempts to maintain the requester within the window's borders, not within the window's bounding box. ReqGadget This field is a pointer to the first in a linked list of Gadget structures. GTYP_REQGADGET must be specified in the GadgetType s field of all Gadget structures that are used in a requester. Take care not to specify gadgets that extend beyond the Requester rectangle specified by the Width and Height fields, as Intuition does no boundary checking. For requesters with custom imagery, where PREDRAWN is set, ReqGadget points to a valid list of gadgets, which are real gadgets in every way except that the gadget text and imagery information are ignored (and can be NULL). The select box, highlighting, and gadget type data are still used. Try to maintain a close correspondence between the gadgets' select boxes and the supplied imagery. String Gadgets and Pre-drawn Requesters. ---------------------------------------- Intuition will not render string gadget text in a predrawn requester. The application must use other rendering means than the predrawn bitmap if it wishes to use string gadgets with a requester. ReqBorder This field is a pointer to an optional linked list of Border structures for drawing lines around and within the requester. The lines specified in the border may go anywhere in the requester; they are not confined to the perimeter of the requester. For requesters with custom imagery, where PREDRAWN is set, this variable is ignored and may be set to NULL. ReqText This field is a pointer to an optional linked list of IntuiText structures containing text for the requester. This is for general text in the requester. For requesters with custom imagery, where PREDRAWN is set, this variable is ignored and can be set to NULL. Flags The following flags may be specified for the Requester: POINTREL Specify POINTREL to indicate that the requester is to appear in a relative rather than a fixed position. For double menu requesters, the position is relative to the pointer. Otherwise, the position of POINTREL requesters is relative to the center of the window. See the discussion of RelLeft and RelTop, above. PREDRAWN Specify PREDRAWN if a custom BitMap structure is supplied for the requester and ImageBMap points to the structure. NOISYREQ Normally, when a requester is active, any gadget, menu, mouse and keyboard events within the parent window are blocked. Specify the NOISYREQ requester flag to allow keyboard and mouse button IDCMP events to be posted, even though the requester is active in the parent window. If the NOISYREQ requester flag is set, the application will receive IDCMP_RAWKEY , IDCMP_VANILLAKEY and IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS events. Note that with NOISYREQ set, IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTON events will also be sent when the user clicks on any of the blocked gadgets in the parent window. Although the reporting of mouse button events depends on NOISYREQ, mouse movement events do not. IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE events are reported if the window flag WFLG_REPORTMOUSE is set in the parent window, or if one of the requester gadgets is down and has the GACT_FOLLOWMOUSE flag set. This is true even if the requester is a double menu requester. USEREQIMAGE Render the linked list of images pointed to by ReqImage after rendering the BackFill color but before gadgets and text. NOREQBACKFILL Do not backfill the requester with the BackFill pen. In addition, Intuition uses these flags in the Requester: REQOFFWINDOW Set by Intuition if the requester is currently active but is positioned off window. REQACTIVE This flag is set or cleared by Intuition as the requester is posted and removed. The active requester is indicated by the value of Window .FirstRequest. SYSREQUEST This flag is set by Intuition if this is a system generated requester. Since the system will never create a true requester in an application window, the application should not be concerned with this flag. BackFill BackFill is the pen number to be used to fill the rectangle of the requester before any drawing takes place. For requesters with custom imagery, where PREDRAWN is set, or for requesters with NOREQBACKFILL set, this variable is ignored. ReqLayer While the requester is active, this contains the address of the Layer structure used in rendering the requester. ImageBMap A pointer to the custom bitmap for this requester. If this requester is not PREDRAWN, Intuition ignores this variable. When a custom bitmap is supplied, the PREDRAWN flag in the requester's Flags field must be set. RWindow Reserved for system use. ReqImage A pointer to a list of Image structures used to create imagery within the requester. Intuition ignores this field if the flag USEREQIMAGE is not set. This imagery is automatically redrawn by Intuition each time the requester needs refreshing. The images are drawn after filling with the BackFill pen, but before the gadgets and text. ReqPad1, ReqPad2 Reserved for system use. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
