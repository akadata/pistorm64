12 / / The Boopsi Gadget Methods / GM_HITTEST ]" border=0> When Intuition gets a left mouse button click in a window, one of the things it does is check through the window's list of gadgets to see if that click was inside the bounds of a gadget's Gadget structure (using the LeftEdge , TopEdge , Width , and Height fields). If it was (and that gadget is a Boopsi gadget), Intuition sends that gadget a GM_HITTEST message (defined in gadgetclass.h >): struct gpHitTest { ULONG MethodID; /* GM_HITTEST */ struct GadgetInfo *gpht_GInfo; struct { WORD X; /* Is this point inside of the gadget? */ WORD Y; } gpht_Mouse; }; This message contains the coordinates of the mouse click. These coordinates are relative to the upper-left of the gadget ( LeftEdge , TopEdge ). Because Intuition can only tell if the user clicked inside gadget's "bounding box", Intuition only knows that the click was close to the gadget. Intuition uses the GM_HITTEST to ask the gadget if the click was really inside the gadget. The gadget returns GMR_GADGETHIT (defined in gadgetclass >) to tell Intuition that the user hit it, otherwise it returns zero. This method allows a gadget to be any shape or pattern, rather than just rectangular. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
