3 / Public Screen Functions / Taking a New Custom Screen Public ]" border=0> Applications that open a new screen should consider taking the screen public . If the screen's characteristics are not very esoteric, making the screen public is useful because it allows other applications to share the working context. This makes an application more powerful and more attractive to the user because it allows the user to add supporting applications and utilities from other vendors to make a customized and integrated work environment. To make your own custom screen into a public screen that other applications may use, you give the screen a public name and then register the screen with Intuition. The screen must be declared as public in the OpenScreenTagList() call by specifying a public name string with the SA_PubName tag. The application's task ID and a signal bit may also be registered when the screen is opened with the SA_PubTask and SA_PubSig tags. If these tags are given, the system will signal your task when the last window on the screen closes. When a new public screen is opened, it starts out private so the application can perform any desired initialization (for instance, opening a backdrop window) before the screen is made public. Use the PubScreenStatus() function to make the screen public and available to other applications (or to take the screen private again, later). The screen may not be taken private or closed until all windows on the screen are closed and all locksn on the screen are released. However, the screen does not need to be made private before closing it. CloseScreen() will fail if an attempt is made to close a public screen that still has visitor windows or locks on it. If the user selects close screen, but the screen will not close due to visitor windows, a requester should be displayed informing the user of the condition and instructing them to close any windows before closing the screen.
