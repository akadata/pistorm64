21 / Task Creation / Task Priority ]" border=0> A task's priority indicates its importance relative to other tasks. Higher-priority tasks receive the processor before lower-priority tasks do. Task priority is stored as a signed number ranging from -128 to +127. Higher priorities are represented by more positive values; zero is considered the neutral priority. Normally, system tasks execute somewhere in the range of +20 to -20, and most application tasks execute at priority 0. It is not wise to needlessly raise a task's priority. Sometimes it may be necessary to carefully select a priority so that the task can properly interact with various system tasks. The SetTaskPri() Exec function is provided for this purpose.
