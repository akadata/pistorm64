A Appendix A: Linker Libraries / Amiga.lib ]" border=0> This is the main Amiga scanned linker library, linked with most programs for the Amiga. The major components of amiga.lib are: * stubs Functions for each Amiga ROM routine that copy arguments from the stack to the CPU registers -- thereby enabling stack-based C compilers to call register-based Amiga ROM routines. * offsets The negative offset from the library base for each Amiga function. These are called Library Vector Offsets (_LVO). * Exec C functions which simplify many Exec procedures such as the creation and deletion of tasks, ports, and I/O request structures. * clib C support functions including pseudo-random number generation and a limited set of file and stdio functions designed to work directly with AmigaDOS file handles. * Math C functions which provide some basic conversions to and from Fast Floating Point (FFP) format numbers. * Graphics C support functions to add and remove tasks from the vertical-blanking interval interrupt server chain. * ARexx C support functions for ARexx variable handling and message checking. NOTE: ----- The Timer, Commodities, and Intuition support functions listed below are valid only for use with Release 2.04 (V37) or a later version of the system software. * Timer C support functions to do common timer device operations. * Commodities C functions which support the Commodities system. Included are functions to deal with ToolTypes, and to create various Commodities objects. * Intuition Functions which provide support for Intuition's hook and Boopsi sub-systems. Most applications link with and use at least one function in amiga.lib. The functions available are as follows.
