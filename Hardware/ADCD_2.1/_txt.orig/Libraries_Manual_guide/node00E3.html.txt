3 / / Creating Custom Screen / Return Values from OpenScreenTagList() ]" border=0> OpenScreenTagList() and its variants return a pointer to a Screen structure on the successful creation of a new screen and NULL on failure. With V36, the call now supports extended error codes on failure. The error returns provide information on the type of failure, giving the application a greater chance of recovery. To get the extended error code, you need to use the SA_ErrorCode tag; the code itself will be placed into the LONG pointed to by the TagItem.ti_Data field. Here are the codes: OSERR_NOMONITOR The monitor needed to display the requested mode is not available. An example of this error would be opening a Productivity mode screen on a system without a VGA or multisync monitor. OSERR_NOCHIPS Newer custom chips are required for this screen mode. For instance, the ECS Denise is required for the productivity modes . OSERR_NOMEM Could not allocate enough memory. OSERR_NOCHIPMEM Could not allocate enough Chip memory. OSERR_PUBNOTUNIQUE Could not create public screen --name already used. The system requires that public screen names be unique. OSERR_UNKNOWNMODE Display mode requested was not recognized. The system does not understand the value specified with the SA_DisplayID tag. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
