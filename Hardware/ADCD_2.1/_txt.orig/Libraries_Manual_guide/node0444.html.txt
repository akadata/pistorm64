33 / Writing IFF Files / A Note On Seekability ]" border=0> As you can see from the above examples, IFFParse works best with a stream that can seek randomly. However, it is not possible to seek on some streams (e.g., pipes). IFFParse will read and write streams with limited or no seek capability. In the case of reading, only forward-seek capability is desirable. Failing this, IFFParse will fake forward seeks with a number of short reads. In the case of writing, if the stream lacks random seek capability, IFFParse will buffer the entire contents of the file until you do the final PopChunk() , or when you CloseIFF() the handle. At that time, the entire stream will be written in one go. This buffering happens whether or not you specify all the chunk sizes to PushChunk() . About the Internal Buffering. ----------------------------- The current implementation of this internal buffering could be more efficient. Be aware that Amiga, Inc. reserves the right to alter this behavior of the parser, to improve performance or reduce memory requirements. We mention this behavior on the off chance it is important to you. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
