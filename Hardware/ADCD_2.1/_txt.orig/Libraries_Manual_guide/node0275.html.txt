15 / / / Implementing a Gadget's Keyboard Equivalent Behavior ]" border=0> Currently, GadTools does not process keyboard equivalents for gadgets. It is up to the application writer to implement the correct behavior, normally by calling GT_SetGadgetAttrs() on the appropriate gadget. For some kinds of gadget, the behavior should be the same regardless of whether the keyboard equivalent was pressed with or without the shift key. For other gadgets, shifted and unshifted keystrokes will have different, usually opposite, effects. Here is the correct behavior for keyboard equivalents for each kind of GadTools gadget: Button Gadgets The keyboard equivalent should invoke the same function that clicking on the gadget does. There is currently no way to highlight the button visuals programmatically when accessing the button through a keyboard equivalent. Text-Entry and Number-Entry Gadgets The keyboard equivalent should activate the gadget so the user may type into it. Use Intuition's ActivateGadget() call. Checkbox Gadgets The keyboard equivalent should toggle the state of the checkbox. Use GT_SetGadgetAttrs() and the GTCB_Checked tag. Mutually-Exclusive Gadgets The unshifted keystroke should activate the next choice, wrapping around from the last to the first. The shifted keystroke should activate the previous choice, wrapping around from the first to the last. Use GT_SetGadgetAttrs() and the GTMX_Active tag. Cycle Gadgets The unshifted keystroke should activate the next choice, wrapping around from the last to the first. The shifted keystroke should activate the previous choice, wrapping around from the first to the last. Use GT_SetGadgetAttrs() and the GTCY_Active tag. Slider Gadgets The unshifted keystroke should increase the slider's level by one, stopping at the maximum, while the shifted keystroke should decrease the level by one, stopping at the minimum. Use GT_SetGadgetAttrs() and the GTSL_Level tag. Scroller Gadgets The unshifted keystroke should increase the scroller's top by one, stopping at the maximum, while the shifted keystroke should decrease the scroller's top by one, stopping at the minimum. Use GT_SetGadgetAttrs() and the GTSC_Top tag. Listview Gadgets The unshifted keystroke should cause the next entry in the list to become the selected one, stopping at the last entry, while the shifted keystroke should cause the previous entry in the list to become the selected one, stopping at the first entry. Use GT_SetGadgetAttrs() and the GTLV_Top and GTLV_Selected tags. Palette Gadgets The unshifted keystroke should select the next color, wrapping around from the last to the first. The shifted keystroke should activate the previous color, wrapping around from the first to the last. Use GT_SetGadgetAttrs() and the GTPA_Color tag. Text-Display and Number-Display Gadgets These kinds of GadTools gadget have no keyboard equivalents since they are not selectable. Generic Gadgets Define appropriate keyboard functions based on the kinds of keyboard behavior defined for other GadTools kinds. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
