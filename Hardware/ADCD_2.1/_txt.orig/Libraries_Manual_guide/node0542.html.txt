D / Errors / Device-related Problems ]" border=0> Device-related problems may caused by: improperly initialized port or I/O request structures (use CreatePort() and CreateExtIO() ); use of a too-small I/O request (see the device's .h > files and Autodocs for information on the required type of I/O request); re-use of an I/O request before it has returned from the device (use the debugging tool IO_Torture to catch this); failure to abort and wait for an outstanding device request before exiting; waiting on a signal/port/message allocated by a different task.
