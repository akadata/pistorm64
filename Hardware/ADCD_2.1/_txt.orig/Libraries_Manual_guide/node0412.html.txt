31 Commodities Exchange Library / New Input Events ]" border=0> Commodities Exchange also has functions used to introduce new input events to the input stream. struct InputEvent *InvertString( UBYTE *string, ULONG *keymap ); void FreeIEvents( struct InputEvent *ie ); void AddIEvents( struct InputEvent *ie ); InvertString() is an amiga.lib function that accepts an ASCII string and creates a linked list of input events that translate into the string using the supplied keymap (or the system default if the key map is NULL). The NULL terminated string may contain ANSI character codes, an input description enclosed in angle (<>) brackets, or one of the following backslash escape characters: \r -- return \t -- tab \\ -- backslash For example: abc \rhi there. FreeIEvents() frees a list of input events allocated by InvertString() . AddIEvents() is a commodities.library function that adds a linked list of input events at the the top of the Commodities network. Each input event in the list is made into an individual CxMessage . Note that if passed a linked list of input events created by InvertString(), the order the events appear in the string will be reversed. PopShell.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
