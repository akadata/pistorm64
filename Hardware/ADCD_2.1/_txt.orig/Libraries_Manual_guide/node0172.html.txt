5 / / Custom String Editing / The SGH_KEY Command ]" border=0> The SGH_KEY command indicates that the user has pressed a key while the gadget is active. This may be any key, including non-character keys such as Shift, Ctrl and Alt. Repeat keys (one call per repeat) and the Amiga keys also cause the hook to be called with the SGH_KEY command. The hook is not called for "key up" events. The SGH_KEY command must be supported by any custom string editing hook. There are no parameters following the SGH_KEY command longword. All information on the event must be derived from the SGWork structure. Intuition has already processed the event and filled-in the SGWork structure before calling the hook. The information included in this structure includes the type of action taken ( EditOp ), the new cursor position ( BufferPos ), the new value in the buffer ( WorkBuffer ), the previous value in the buffer ( PrevBuffer ), the input event that caused this call ( IEvent ) and more.
