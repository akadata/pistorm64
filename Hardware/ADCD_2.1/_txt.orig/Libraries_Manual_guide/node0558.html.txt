D / Errors / Performance Loss--On A3000 ]" border=0> If your program has "Enforcer hits" (i.e., illegal references to memory caused by improperly initialized pointers), this will cause Bus Errors. The A3000 bus error handler contains a built-in delay to let the bus settle. If you have many enforcer hits, this could slow your program down substantially. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
