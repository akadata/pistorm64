20 / / Memory Information Functions / Memory Requirements ]" border=0> The same attribute flags used in memory allocation routines are valid for the memory information routines.

Specifying the MEMF_TOTAL flag will return the total amount of memory currently available. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
