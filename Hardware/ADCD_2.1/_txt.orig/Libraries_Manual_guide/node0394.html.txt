28 / Advanced Topics / How VSprite and Playfield Colors Interact ]" border=0> At the start of each display, the system loads the colors from the ViewPort 's color table into the display's hardware registers, so whatever is rendered into the BitMap is displayed correctly. But if the VSprite system is used, and the colors are specified (via SprColors ) for each VSprite, the SprColors will be loaded by the system into the display hardware, as needed. The system does this by generating Copper instructions that will jam the colors into the hardware at specific moments in the display cycle. Any BitMap rendering, including Bobs, which share colors with VSprites, may change colors constantly as the video display beam progresses down the screen. This color changing can be avoided by taking one of the following precautions: * Use a four bitplane playfield, which only allows the lower 16 colors to be rendered into the BitMap (and allows Hires display mode). * If a 32-color playfield display is being used, avoid rendering in colors 17-19, 21-23, 25-27, and 29-32, which are the colors affected by the VSprite system. * Specify the VSprite SprColors pointer as a value of NULL to avoid changing the contents of any of the hardware sprite color registers. This may cause the VSprites to change colors depending on their positions relative to each other, as described in the previous section . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
