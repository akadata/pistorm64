33 / / Management Functions / CollectionChunk() and FindCollection() ]" border=0> PropChunk() keeps only one copy of the declared chunk (the one currently in scope). CollectionChunk() collects and keeps all instances of a specified chunk. This is useful for chunks such as the ILBM CRNG chunk, which can appear multiple times in a FORM , and which don't override previous instances of themselves. CollectionChunk() is called identically to PropChunk(): error = CollectionChunk (iff, type, id); When you wish to find the collected chunks currently in scope, you use the function FindCollection() : ci = FindCollection (iff, type, id); You will be returned a pointer to a CollectionItem , which is part of a singly-linked list of all copies of the specified chunk collected so far that are currently in scope. struct CollectionItem { struct CollectionItem *ci_Next; LONG ci_Size; UBYTE *ci_Data; }; The size of this copy of the chunk is in the CollectionItem's ci_Size field. The ci_Data field points to the chunk data itself. The ci_Next field points to the next CollectionItem in the list. The last element in the list has ci_Next set to NULL. The most recently-encountered instance of the chunk will be first in the list, followed by earlier chunks. Some might consider this ordering backwards. If NULL is returned, the specified chunk was never encountered. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
