7 / True Requesters / Requester Refresh Type ]" border=0> A requester appears in a Layer . By default, the requester layer is of type LAYERSMART, or, in window terminology, WFLG_SMART_REFRESH ; so rendering is preserved in the requester when the window is moved or revealed. Requesters may also be simple refresh. This is the recommended type. If possible, make the requester a simple refresh layer requester by specifying the SIMPLEREQ flag. For all refresh types, Intuition will keep the gadget, border, image and bitmap imagery properly refreshed. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
