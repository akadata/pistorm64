D / Errors / Crashes--Only on 68040 ]" border=0> Because of the instruction pipelining of the 68040, it is very difficult to recover from a bus error. If your program has an "Enforcer hit" (i.e., an illegal reference to memory), the resulting 68040 processor bus error will probably crash the machine. Use Enforcer (on an '030) to track down your problems, then correct them. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
