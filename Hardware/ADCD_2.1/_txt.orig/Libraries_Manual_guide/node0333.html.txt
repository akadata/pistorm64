27 / Display Routines and Structures / Loading and Displaying the View ]" border=0> To display the View , you need to load it using LoadView() and turn on the direct memory access (DMA). A typical call is shown below. LoadView(&view); The &view argument is the address of the View structure defined in the example above . There are two macros, defined in gfxmacros.h >, that control display DMA: ON_DISPLAY and OFF_DISPLAY. They simply turn the display DMA control bit in the DMA control register on or off. If you are drawing to the display area and do not want the user to see intermediate steps in the drawing, you can turn off the display. Because OFF_DISPLAY shuts down the display DMA and possibly speeds up other system operations, it can be used to provide additional memory cycles to the blitter or the 68000. The distribution of system DMA, however, allows four-channel sound, disk read/write, and a sixteen-color, low-resolution display (or four-color, high-resolution display) to operate at the same time with no slowdown (7.1 megahertz effective rate) in the operation of the 68000. Using OFF_DISPLAY in a multitasking environment may, however, be an unfriendly thing to do to the other running processes. Use OFF_DISPLAY with discretion.
