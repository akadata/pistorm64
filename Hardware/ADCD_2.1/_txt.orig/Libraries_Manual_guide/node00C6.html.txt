RKM Libraries: 2 Intuition and the Amiga Graphical User Interface ]" border=0> Intuition is the collective name for the function libraries, data structures and other elements needed to create a graphical interface for Amiga applications. Programmers use Intuition to perform user interface chores such as opening windows, managing menus, monitoring gadgets, reading the mouse position and so forth. Newcomers to the Amiga sometimes think of Intuition as the Amiga's operating system but it is not. Intuition is just one component that together with Exec , AmigaDOS, and other subsystems make up the whole operating system. Intuition is the most visible part of the operating system though since it provides the graphical user interface familiar to all Amiga users.
