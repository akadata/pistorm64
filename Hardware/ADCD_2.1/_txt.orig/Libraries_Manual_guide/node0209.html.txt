12 / / The Public Classes / The Imageclass Subclasses ]" border=0> Normally, an application does not create an imageclass object. Instead, it will use a subclass of imageclass. Currently, there are four subclasses: frameiclass, sysiclass, fillrectclass, and itexticlass. frameiclass An embossed or recessed rectangular frame image, that renders itself using the proper DrawInfo pens. This class is intelligent enough to bound or center its contents. sysiclass The class of system images. The class includes the images for the system and GadTools gadgets. fillrectclass A class of rectangle images that have frame and patternfill support. itexticlass A specialized image class used for rendering text. For more information on these classes see the Boopsi Class Reference in the Appendix B of this manual. It describes all of the existing public classes, their methods, and their attributes.
