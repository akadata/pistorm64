6 / Setting Up Menus / Submitting and Removing Menu Strips ]" border=0> Once the application has set up the proper menu structures, linked them into a list and attached the list to a window, the menu system completely handles the menu display. The menu strip is submitted to Intuition and attached to the window by calling the function SetMenuStrip() . BOOL SetMenuStrip( struct Window *window, struct Menu *menu ); SetMenuStrip() always returns TRUE. This function can also be used to attach a single menu strip to multiple windows by calling SetMenuStrip() for each window ( see below ). Any menu strip attached to a window must be removed before the window is closed. To remove the menu strip, call ClearMenuStrip() . void ClearMenuStrip( struct Window *window ); The menu example below demonstrates how to use these functions with a simple menu strip.
