22 Exec Signals / The Signal System ]" border=0> The signal system is designed to support independent simultaneous events, so several signals can occur at the same time. Each task has 32 independent signals, 16 of which are pre-allocated for use by the operating system. The signals in use by a particular task are represented as bits in a 32-bit field in its Task structure ( tasks.h >). Two other 32-bit fields in the Task structure indicate which signals the task is waiting for, and which signals have been received. Signals are task relative. A task can only allocate its own signals, and may only wait on its own signals. In addition, a task may assign its own significance to a particular signal. Signals are not broadcast to all tasks; they are directed only to individual tasks. A signal has meaning to the task that defined it and to those tasks that have been informed of its meaning. For example, signal bit 12 may indicate a timeout event to one task, but to another task it may indicate a message arrival event. You can never wait on a signal that you did not directly or indirectly allocate yourself, and any other task that wishes to signal you must use a signal that you allocated.
