7 Intuition Requesters and Alerts / Types Of Requesters ]" border=0> There are at least three kinds of display objects in Amiga terminology called requesters: true requesters, system requesters and ASL requesters. True requesters are general purpose display areas that can be thought of as temporary sub-windows. They display information to the user and allow the user to make a selection. True requesters always open within an existing window and are constrained to the boundaries of that window (often referred to as the parent window). If a requester extends beyond the edge of its parent window, either its position is adjusted or its graphics are clipped. True requesters always block input to their parent window as long as they are present. System requesters are typically used for warnings or to confirm an action the user has just initiated. System requesters differ from true requesters in that they cannot block input to the parent window. In fact, system requesters do not open in a parent window at all, but instead open their own separate window in the screen. Since these requesters are so different from true requesters, they will be discussed separately later in the chapter. See the sections on " Easy Requesters " and " System Requests " for more information. The third type of requester, the ASL requester, is a special purpose requester available only in Release 2 and later versions of the OS. ASL requesters provide an easy, standard way to get a filename from the user for load and save operations. They can also be used to get a font selection from the user. Since selecting a file or font name is one of the most common uses for a requester, it has been incorporated into Release 2 as a standard feature. For the details about ASL file and font requesters, see Chapter 16, " ASL Library ". [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
