15 / GadTools Gadgets / IDCMP Flags ]" border=0> The various GadTools gadget types require certain classes of IDCMP messages in order to work. Applications specify these IDCMP classes when the window is opened or later with ModifyIDCMP() (see " Intuition Windows " chapter for more on this). Each kind of GadTools gadget requires one or more of these IDCMP classes: IDCMP_GADGETUP , IDCMP_GADGETDOWN , IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE , IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS and IDCMP_INTUITICKS . As a convenience, the IDCMP classes required by each kind of gadget are defined in gadtools.h >. For example, SLIDERIDCMP is defined to be: #define SLIDERIDCMP (IDCMP_GADGETUP | IDCMP_GADGETDOWN | IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE) Always OR the IDCMP Flag Bits. ------------------------------ When specifying the IDCMP classes for a window, never add the flags together, always OR the bits together. Since many of the GadTools IDCMP constants have multiple bits set, adding the values will not lead to the proper flag combination. If a certain kind of GadTools gadget is used, the window must use all IDCMP classes required by that kind of gadget. Do not omit any that are given for that class, even if the application does require the message type. Because of the way GadTools gadgets are implemented, programs that use them always require notification about window refresh events. Even if the application performs no rendering of its own, it may not use the WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH window flag and must always set IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW . See the section on " Gadget Refresh Functions " later in this chapter for more on this. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
