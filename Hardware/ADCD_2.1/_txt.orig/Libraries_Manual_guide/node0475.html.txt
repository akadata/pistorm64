34 / / Details Of the Keymap Structure / Repeatable Bit Tables ]" border=0> The vectors km_LoRepeatable and km_HiRepeatable each point to an array of 8 bytes that contain additional information about the keytable entries. A bit for each key indicates whether or not the specified key should repeat at the rate set by the Input Preferences program. The bit positions correspond to those specified in the capsable bit table. If there is a 1 in a specific position, the key can repeat. There are 64 bits (8 bytes) in each of the two repeatable tables. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
