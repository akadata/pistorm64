21 / Processor and Cache Control / Status Register ]" border=0> The processor status register bits can be set or read with the SetSR() function. This function operates in supervisor mode , thus both the upper and lower byte of the SR can be read or set. Be very sure you know what you are doing when you use this function to set bits in the SR and above all never try to use this function to enter supervisor mode. Refer to the M68000 Programmers Reference Manual by Motorola Inc. for information about the definition of individual SR bits per processor type. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
