37 Utility Library / 32-bit Integer Math Functions ]" border=0> Utility library contains some high-speed math functions for 32-bit integer division and multiplication. These functions will take advantage of available processor instructions (like DIVUL), if a 68020 processor or higher is present. If not, these functions will mimic those instructions in 68000 only instructions, thus providing processor independency. Currently the following functions are implemented: ____________________________________________________________ | | | SDivMod32() Signed 32 by 32-bit division and modulus. | | SMult32() Signed 32 by 32-bit multiplication. | | UDivMod32() Unsigned 32 by 32-bit division and modulus. | | UMult32() Unsigned 32 by 32-bit multiplication. | |____________________________________________________________| Table 37-3: Utility Library 32-bit Math Functions The division functions return the quotient in D0 and the remainder in D1. To obtain the remainder in a higher level language, either a compiler specific instruction to fetch the contents of a specific register must be used (like getreg() in SAS C) or a small assembler stub. Following a simple example of the usage of the 32-bit integer math functions in C. uptime.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
