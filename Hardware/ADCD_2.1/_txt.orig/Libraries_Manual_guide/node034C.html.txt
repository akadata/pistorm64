27 / / The RastPort Structure / Initializing a RastPort Structure ]" border=0> Once you have a BitMap set up, you can declare and initialize the RastPort and then link the BitMap into it. Here is a sample initialization sequence: struct BitMap bitMap = {0}; struct RastPort rastPort = {0}; /* Initialize the RastPort and link the BitMap to it. */ InitRastPort(&rastPort); rastPort.BitMap = &bitMap; Initialize, Then Link. ---------------------- You cannot link the bitmap in until after the RastPort has been initialized.
