33 / / Creating Chunks In a File / PushChunk() ]" border=0> To tell IFFParse you are about to begin writing a new chunk, you use the function PushChunk() : error = PushChunk (iff, ID_ILBM, ID_BMHD,chunksize); The chunk ID and size are written to the stream. IFFParse will enforce the chunk size you specified; attempts to write past the end of the chunk will be truncated. If, as a chunk size argument, you pass IFFSIZE_UNKNOWN, the chunk will be expanded in size as you write data to it. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
