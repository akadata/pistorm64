B / propgclass / Changed Methods: GM_HANDLEINPUT ]" border=0> If the knob position changes sufficiently to change a propgclass object's PGA_Top attribute, the gadget will send an OM_NOTIFY message to itself, which the propgclass dispatcher passes on to the gadgetclass dispatcher for processing (see the rootclass description of OM_NOTIFY and OM_UPDATE for more information). The OM_NOTIFY message will contain two attribute/value pairs, PGA_Top and GA_ID. While the prop gadget's PGA_Top is in a transitory state (while it is active and the user is moving the prop gadget's knob), the gadget sends interim OM_NOTIFY messages. The interim OM_NOTIFY messages have the OPUF_INTERIM flag of the opUpdate.opu_Flags field set. When the user finishes manipulating the gadget (by letting go of the knob), the gadget sends a final OM_NOTIFY message, which has a cleared OPUF_INTERIM flag. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
