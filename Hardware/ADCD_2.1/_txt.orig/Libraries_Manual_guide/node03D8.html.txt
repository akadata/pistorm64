29 / The Text Function / Rendering the Text ]" border=0> When the Text() routine renders text, it renders at the current rastport position along the text's baseline. The baseline is an imaginary line on top of which the text is rendered. Each font has a baseline that is a constant number of pixels from the top of the font's bitmap. For most fonts, parts of some characters are rendered both above and below the baseline (for example, y, g, and j usually have parts above and below the baseline). The part below the baseline is called the descender. Figure 29-1: Descenders and Baseline of Amiga Fonts Because Text() only increments the rastport's current X position as it renders text horizontally, programs that need to print several lines of text have to take care of moving the current pointer to the beginning of the next line, usually with the graphics.library's Move() function: void Move( struct RastPort *rp, LONG x, long y ); When moving the current position to the beginning of the next line, an application must make sure it leaves enough space above and below the baseline to prevent characters on different lines from overlapping each other. There are a few fields in the TextFont structure returned by OpenFont() and OpenDiskFont() that are useful for spacing and rendering text: struct TextFont { struct Message tf_Message; /* reply message for font removal */ /* font name in LN | used in this */ UWORD tf_YSize; /* font height | order to best */ UBYTE tf_Style; /* font style | match a font */ UBYTE tf_Flags; /* preferences and flags / request. */ UWORD tf_XSize; /* nominal font width */ UWORD tf_Baseline; /* distance from the top of char to baseline */ UWORD tf_BoldSmear; /* smear to affect a bold enhancement */ UWORD tf_Accessors; /* access count */ UBYTE tf_LoChar; /* the first character described here */ UBYTE tf_HiChar; /* the last character described here */ APTR tf_CharData; /* the bit character data */ UWORD tf_Modulo; /* the row modulo for the strike font data */ APTR tf_CharLoc; /* ptr to location data for the strike font */ /* 2 words: bit offset then size */ APTR tf_CharSpace; /* ptr to words of proportional spacing data */ APTR tf_CharKern; /* ptr to words of kerning data */ }; The fields of interest to applications are as follows. tf_YSize The "height", in pixels, of this font. None of the characters in this font will be taller than this value. tf_XSize This is the character width for monospaced (non-proportional) fonts. The width includes the extra space needed to the left and right of the character to keep the characters from running together. tf_Baseline The distance in pixels from the top line of the font to the baseline. tf_LoChar This is the first character glyph (the graphical symbol associated with this font) defined in this font. All characters that have ASCII values below this value do not have an associated glyph. tf_HiChar This is the last character glyph defined in this font. All characters that have ASCII values above this value do not have an associated glyph. An application can use these values to avoid rendering characters which have no associated glyphs. Any characters without an associated glyph will have the default glyph associated to them. Normally, the default glyph is a rectangle. To erase text, the graphics.library provides two functions that were specifically designed to clear parts of a rastport based on the dimensions of the current font: void ClearEOL( struct RastPort *rp ); void ClearScreen( struct RastPort *rp ); Using the current font, ClearEOL() will clear the rest of the current text line from the rastport's current position to the edge of the rastport. ClearEOL() was introduced in the Release 2 graphics.library. ClearScreen() will clear the rest of the line as ClearEOL() does, but it will also clear the rastport below the current line of text.
