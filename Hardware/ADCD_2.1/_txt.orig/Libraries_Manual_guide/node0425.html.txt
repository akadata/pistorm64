32 / / RigidDiskBlock and Alternate Filesystems / filesysres.h and .i ]" border=0> The FileSysResource is created by the first code that needs to use it. It is added to the resource list for others to use. (Checking and creation should be performed while Forbid() is in effect). Under Release 2 the resource is created by the system early on in the initialization sequence. Under 1.3 it is the responsibility of the first RDB driver to create it. FileSysResource fsr_Node on resource list with the name FileSystem.resource fsr_Creator name of creator of this resource fsr_FileSysEntries list of FileSysEntry structs FileSysEntry fse_Node on fsr_FileSysEntries list ln_Name is of creator of this entry fse_DosType DosType of this FileSys fse_Version release version of this FileSys Usually MSW is version, LSW is revision. fse_PatchFlags bits set for those of the following that need to be substituted into a standard device node for this file system: e.g. $180 for substitute SegList & GlobalVec fse_Type device node type: zero fse_Task standard dos "task" field fse_Lock not used for devices: zero fse_Handler filename to loadseg (if SegList is null) fse_StackSize stacksize to use when starting task fse_Priority task priority when starting task fse_Startup startup msg: FileSysStartupMsg for disks fse_SegList segment of code to run to start new task fse_GlobalVec BCPL global vector when starting task No more entries need exist than those implied by fse_PatchFlags, so entries do not have a fixed size. For additional information on initializing and booting a Rigid Disk Block filesystem device, see the SCSI Device chapter of the Addison-Wesley Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices. Writers of drivers for expansion devices that perform their own DMA (direct memory access) should consult the Exec chapters and Autodocs for information on Release 2 processor cache control functions including CachePreDMA() and CachePostDMA() .
