1 / / Design Decisions / ASL Requesters ]" border=0> The Release 2 ASL library provides standard file and font requesters. Allocation and use of an ASL requester can be handled by coding a simple subroutine to use the ASL requester if available. Otherwise use fallback code or a public domain requester. By now, many of you have probably coded your own requesters and you may be quite attached to them. In that case, at least give your users the option to use the ASL requester if they wish. By using the ASL requesters, you can provide a familiar interface to your users, gain the automatic benefit of all ASL file requester improvements, and stop maintaining your own requester code.
