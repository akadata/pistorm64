27 / / Using the Graphics Drawing Routines / Drawing Patterned Lines ]" border=0> To turn the example above into a patterned line draw, simply set a drawing pattern, such as: SetDrPt(&rastPort, 0xAAAA); Now all lines drawn appear as dotted lines (0xAAAA = 1010101010101010 in binary). To resume drawing solid lines, execute the statement: SetDrPt(&rastPort, ~0); Because ~0 is defined as all bits on (11...11) in binary. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
