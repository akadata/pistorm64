15 / GadTools Gadgets / Creating Gadget Lists ]" border=0> In the discussion of CreateGadget() presented earlier, the examples showed only how to make a single gadget. For most applications that use GadTools, however, a whole list of gadgets will be needed. To do this, the application could use code such as this: struct NewGadget *newgad1, *newgad2, *newgad3; struct Gadget *glist = NULL; struct Gadget *pgad; ... /* Initialize NewGadget structures */ ... /* Note that CreateContext() requires a POINTER to a NULL-initialized * pointer to struct Gadget: */ pgad = CreateContext(&glist); pgad = CreateGadget(BUTTON_KIND, pgad, newgad1, TAG_END); pgad = CreateGadget(STRING_KIND, pgad, newgad2, TAG_END); pgad = CreateGadget(MX_KIND, pgad, newgad3, TAG_END); if (!pgad) { FreeGadgets(glist); exit_error(); } else { if ( mywin=OpenWindowTags(NULL, WA_Gadgets, glist, ... /* Other tags... */ ... TAG_END) ) { /* Complete the rendering of the gadgets */ GT_RefreshWindow(win, NULL); ... /* and continue on... */ ... CloseWindow(mywin); } FreeGadgets(glist); } The pointer to the previous gadget, pgad in the code fragment above, is used for three purposes. First, when CreateGadget() is called multiple times, each new gadget is automatically linked to the previous gadget's NextGadget field, thus creating a gadget list. Second, if one of the gadget creations fails (usually due to low memory, but other causes are possible), then for the next call to CreateGadget(), pgad will be NULL and CreateGadget() will fail immediately. This means that the program can perform several successive calls to CreateGadget() and only have to check for failure at the end. Finally, although this information is hidden in the implementation and not important to the application, certain calls to CreateGadget() actually cause several Intuition gadgets to be allocated and these are automatically linked together without program interaction, but only if a previous gadget pointer is supplied. If several gadgets are created by a single CreateGadget() call, they work together to provide the functionality of a single GadTools gadget. The application should always act as though the gadget pointer returned by CreateGadget() points to a single gadget instance. See "Documented Side-Effects" for a warning. There is one exception to the fact that a program only has to check for failure after the last CreateGadget() call and that is when the application depends on the successful creation of a gadget and caches or immediately uses the gadget pointer returned by CreateGadget(). For instance, if the program wants to create a string gadget and save a pointer to the string buffer, it might do so as follows: gad = CreateGadget(STRING_KIND, gad, &ng, GTST_String, "Hello World", TAG_END); if (gad) { stringbuffer = ((struct StringInfo *)(gad->SpecialInfo))->Buffer; } /* Creation can continue here: */ gad = CreateGadget(..._KIND, gad, &ng2, ... TAG_END); A major benefit of having a reusable NewGadget structure is that often many fields do not change and some fields change incrementally. For example, the application can set just the NewGadget's ng_VisualInfo and ng_TextAttr only once and never have to modify them again even if the structure is reused to create many gadgets. A set of similar gadgets may share size and some positional information so that code such as the following might be used: /* Assume that the NewGadget structure 'ng' is fully * initialized here for a button labelled "OK" */ gad = CreateGadget(BUTTON_KIND, gad, &ng, TAG_END); /* Modify only those fields that need to change: */ ng.ng_GadgetID++; ng.ng_LeftEdge += 80; ng.ng_GadgetText = "Cancel"; gad = CreateGadget(BUTTON_KIND, gad, &ng, TAG_END); Warning: -------- All gadgets created by GadTools currently have the GADTOOL_TYPE bit set in their GadgetType field. It is not correct to check for, set, clear or otherwise rely on this since it is subject to change. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
