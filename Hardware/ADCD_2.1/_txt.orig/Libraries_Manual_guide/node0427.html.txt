Amiga® RKM Libraries: 33 IFFParse Library ]" border=0> The iffparse.library was created to help simplify the job of parsing IFF files. Unlike other IFF libraries, iffparse.library is not form-specific. This means that the job of interpreting the structure and contents of the IFF file is up to you. Previous IFF file parsers were either simple but not general, or general but not simple. IFFParse tries to be both simple and general.
