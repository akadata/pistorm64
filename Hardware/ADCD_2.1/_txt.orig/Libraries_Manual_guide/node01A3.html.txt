7 / True Requesters / Requester I/O ]" border=0> So long as a requester is active in a window, the only gadgets that can be used are those that are in the requester, plus all of the window's system gadgets except for the close gadget (i.e., the drag bar, size gadget, depth gadget, and zoom gadget). A requester also makes the menus of the parent window inaccessible. Additionally, mouse button and keyboard events will be blocked (unless the requester's NOISYREQ flag is set; see " Requester Structure " below). Mouse movement events, if enabled in the parent window (with WFLG_REPORTMOUSE ), are not blocked. Requesters do not have their own IDCMP message ports. Instead, events for a requester are sent to the IDCMP port of the requester's parent window ( Window.UserPort ). Since the window's menus and application gadgets are inaccessible, no IDCMP events will be sent for them. Even though the window containing the requester is blocked for input, the user can work in another application or even in a different window of the same application without satisfying the requester. Only input to the parent window is blocked by a requester. Output is not blocked by a requester so nothing prevents the application from writing to the window. Be aware, however, that the requester obscures part of the display and cannot be moved within the window so this may limit the usefulness of any output you send to the parent window. There are several ways to monitor the comings and goings of requesters that allow the program to know if requesters are currently displayed in a given window. See " IDCMP Requester Features " below. The information displayed in a requester is placed in its own layer, so it does not overwrite the information in the window. Output to the window while the requester is displayed will not change the requester's display, it will go into the window's layer. The requester's layer is clipped to the window's boundaries, so the data in the requester is only visible if the window is large enough to allow for the complete display of that data. The requester will remain in the window and input will remain blocked until the user satisfies the request or the application removes the requester. Applications can set up some or all of the gadgets in the requester to automatically terminate the requester when the gadget is selected. This allows the requester to be removed from the window by user action. The application may also remove requesters from the window based on some event internal to the program. Multiple requesters may be nested in a single window. Such requesters must be satisfied in the reverse order in which they were posted; the last requester to be displayed must be satisfied first. Input will not be restored to a previous requester until all later requesters are satisfied. Note that the application may not bring up a limitless number of requesters in a window. Each requester creates a new layer for rendering in its window and the system currently has a limit of ten layers per window. Normal windows use one layer for the window rendering, GimmeZeroZero windows use a second layer for the border rendering. This leaves a maximum of eight or nine simultaneous requesters open in a window at any given time. If the requester is being brought up only to display an error message, the application may want to use a less intrusive method of bringing the error to the user's attention than a requester. Requesters interrupt the flow of the user's work, and force them to respond before continuing. As an alternative to bringing up an error requester, the application could flash the screen instead with Intuition's DisplayBeep() function. This allows the application to notify the user of an error that is not serious enough to warrant a requester and to which the user does not really need to respond. For more information, see the description of DisplayBeep() in the " Intuition Screens " chapter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
