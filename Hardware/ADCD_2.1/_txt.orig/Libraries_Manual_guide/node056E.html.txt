E / Release 2 Changes That Can Affect Compatibility / Workbench ]" border=0> * The Workbench GUI now has new screen sizes, screen top/left offsets, depths, modes, and fonts. * Default Tool now searches paths. * New Look (boxed) icons take more space. * Do not use icons which have more 1bits set in PlanePick than planes in the ImageData (one IFF-to-Icon utility does this). Such icons will appear trashed on deeper Workbenches. * New Look colors have black and white swapped (as compared to 1.3). * The Workbench screen may not be open at startup-sequence time until some output occurs to the initial Shell window. This can break startup-sequence-started games that think they can steal WB's screen bitplanes. Do not steal the Workbench screen's bitplanes. (For compatibility, booting off pre-2.0 disks forces the initial screen open. This is not guaranteed to remain in the system.) Use startup code that can detach when RUN (such as cback.o) and use CloseWorkbench() to regain the screen's memory. In addition, see " Workbench and Startup " in the "Additional Information" section below. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
