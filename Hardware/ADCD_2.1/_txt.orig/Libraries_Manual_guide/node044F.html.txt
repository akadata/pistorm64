33 / / Storing LCIs / StoreItemInContext() ]" border=0> StoreItemInContext() is used when you already have a pointer to the ContextNode to which you want to attach your LCI . It is called like so: StoreItemInContext (iff, lci, contextnode); StoreItemInContext() links your LCI into the specified ContextNode . Then it searches the ContextNode to see if there is another LCI with the same type, ID, and identification values. If so, the old one is deleted. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
