Amiga® RKM Libraries: 9 Intuition Input and Output Methods ]" border=0> This chapter discusses the input and output (I/O) techniques used with Intuition. I/O facilities are also available through Exec's device subsystems, such as the console, serial and parallel devices. (For more information on these see the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices .) For graphical output to the Amiga's display, programs can use Intuition's drawing features or handle rendering directly through calls to the graphics library. See the three graphics library chapters in this manual for more information on display rendering. For more about Intuition's drawing features see the " Intuition Images, Line Drawing and Text " chapter.
