28 / Using Bobs / Bob Priorities ]" border=0> This subsection describes the choices for inter-Bob priorities. The inter-Bob priorities tell the system what order to render the Bobs. Bobs rendered earlier will appear to be behind later Bobs. A Bob drawn earlier is said to have the lower priority and a Bob drawn later is said to have the higher priority. Thus, the highest priority Bob will be drawn last and will never be obstructed by another Bob. Letting the System Decide Priorities Specifying the Drawing Order [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
