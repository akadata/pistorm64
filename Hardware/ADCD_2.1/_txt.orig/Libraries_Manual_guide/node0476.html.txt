34 / Keymap Functions / Key Map Standards ]" border=0> Users and programs depend on certain predictable behaviors from all keyboards and keymaps. With the exception of dead-class keys (see " Dead-Class Keys" section), mapping of keys in the low key map should follow these general rules: * When pressed alone, keys should transmit the ASCII equivalent of the unshifted letter or lower symbol on the keycap. * When Shifted, keys should transmit the ASCII equivalent of the shifted letter or upper symbol printed on the keycap. * When Alt'ed, keys should generally transmit the same character (or act as the same deadkey ) as the Alt'ed key in the usa1 keymap. * When pressed with CTRL alone, alphabetic keys should generally transmit their unshifted value but with bits 5 and 6 cleared. This allows keyboard typing of "control characters." For example, the C key (normally value $63) should transmit value $03 (Ctrl-C) when Ctrl and C are pressed together. The keys in the high key map (keys with raw key values $40 and higher) are generally non-alphanumeric keys such as those used for editing (backspace, delete, cursor keys, etc.), and special Amiga keys such as the function and help keys. Keymaps should translate these keys to the same values or strings as those shown in table 34-6 , ROM Default Key Mapping. In addition to their normal unshifted and shifted values, the following translations are standard for particular qualified high keymap keys: Generates If Used with Qualifier, Key This Value Generates This Value --- ---------- ----------------------- Space $20 $A0 with qualifier KCF_ALT Return $0D $0A with qualifier KCF_CONTROL Esc $1B $9B with qualifier KCF_ALT [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
