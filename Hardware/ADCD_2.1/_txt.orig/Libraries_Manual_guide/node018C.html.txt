6 / Setting Up Menus / About Menu Item Boxes ]" border=0> The item box is the rectangle containing the menu items or sub-items. The size and location of the item or sub-item boxes is not directly described by the application. Instead, the size is indirectly described by the placement of items and sub-items. When presented with a menu strip, Intuition first calculates the minimum size box required to hold the items. It then adjusts the box to ensure the menu display conforms to certain design philosophy constraints for items and sub-items. Figure 6-2: Example Item Box The item box must start no further right than the leftmost position of the menu header's select box. It must end no further left than the rightmost position of the menu header's select box. The top edge of each item box must overlap the screen's title bar by one line. Each sub-item box must overlap its item's select box somewhere. Always Overlap. --------------- If your application is designed to work on systems prior to V37, do not leave space between sub-items in a sub-item list. This may cause flickering as the pointer moves off one item into the gap between the items. Even a single line between the items may cause flickering. This flickering is eliminated starting with V37.
