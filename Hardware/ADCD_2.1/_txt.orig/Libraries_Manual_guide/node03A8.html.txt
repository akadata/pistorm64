28 / Using Bobs / Changing Bobs ]" border=0> The following characteristics of Bobs can be changed dynamically between calls to DrawGList() : * To change the location of the Bob in the RastPort drawing area, adjust the X and Y values in the VSprite structure associated with this Bob. * To change a Bob's appearance, the pointer to the ImageData in the associated VSprite structure may be changed. Note that a change in the ImageData also requires a change or recalculation of the ImageShadow , using InitMasks() . * To change a Bob's colors modify the PlanePick , PlaneOnOff or Depth parameters in the VSprite structure associated with this Bob. * To change a Bob's display priorities, alter the Before and After pointers in the Bob structure. * To change the Bob into a paintbrush, specify the SAVEBOB flag in the Bob.Flags field. Changes Are Not Immediately Seen. --------------------------------- Neither these nor other changes are evident until SortGList() and then DrawGList() are called. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
