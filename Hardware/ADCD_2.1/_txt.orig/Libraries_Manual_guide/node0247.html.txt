14 Workbench and Icon Library / Workbench and the Startup Code Module ]" border=0> Standard startup code handles the detail work of interfacing with the arguments and environment of Workbench and the Shell (or CLI). This section describes the behavior of standard startup modules such as the ones supplied with SAS (Lattice) C and Manx Aztec C. The environment for a program started from Workbench is quite different from the environment for a program started from the Shell. The Shell does not create a new process for a program; it jumps to the program's code and the program shares the process with the Shell. Programs run under the Shell have access to all the Shell's environment, including the ability to modify that environment. (Programs run from the Shell should be careful to restore all values that existed on startup.) Workbench starts a program as a new DOS process, explicitly passing the execution environment to the program. Workbench Startup Shell Startup [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
