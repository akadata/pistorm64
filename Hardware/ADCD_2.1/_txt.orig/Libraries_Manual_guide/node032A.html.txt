27 / / Viewport Display Modes / Interlaced vs. Non-interlaced Mode ]" border=0> In interlaced mode, there are twice as many lines available as in non-interlaced mode, providing better vertical resolution in the same display area. ----------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------- ------------ ------------- ----------- 200 lines define ------------ ViewPort.Modes = 0 ----------- a full screen ------------ ------------ ------------- ----------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------- ========================================= ========================================= ============ ============= =========== 400 lines define ============ ViewPort.Modes = LACE =========== a full screen ============ ============ ============= ========================================= ========================================= Figure 27-15: How LACE Affects Vertical Resolution If the View structure does not specify LACE , and the ViewPort specifies LACE, only the top half of the ViewPort data will be displayed. If the View structure specifies LACE and the ViewPort is non-interlaced, the same ViewPort data will be repeated in both fields. The height of the ViewPort display is the height specified in the ViewPort structure. If both the View and the ViewPort are interlaced, the ViewPort will be built with double the normal vertical resolution. That means it will need twice as much data space in memory as a non-interlaced picture to fill the display. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
