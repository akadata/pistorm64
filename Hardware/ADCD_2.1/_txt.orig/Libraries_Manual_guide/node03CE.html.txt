28 / Animation with GELs / Standard Gel Rules Still Apply ]" border=0> Before you use the animation system, you must have called the routine InitGels() . The section called " Bob Priorities " describes how the system maintains the list of GELs to draw on the screen according to their various data fields. The animation system selectively adds GELs to and removes GELs from this list of screen objects during the Animate() routine. On the next call to DrawGList() , the system will draw the GELs in the list into the selected RastPort . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
