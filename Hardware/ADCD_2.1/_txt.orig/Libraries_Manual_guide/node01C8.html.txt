8 / Creating Text / Directly Drawing the IntuiText ]" border=0> Use the PrintIText() call to directly draw the text into the target RastPort of a window or screen. void PrintIText( struct RastPort *rp, struct IntuiText *iText, long left, long top ); The rp argument is a pointer to the RastPort into which the text should be drawn. This RastPort can come from a Window or Screen structure. The iText argument is a pointer to a list of IntuiText structures which are to be rendered. The list may contain a single IntuiText structure. If the font is not specified in the IntuiText structure, Intuition will render the text using the RastPort 's font. The left and top arguments give the external component, or base position for this list of IntuiText structures. The LeftEdge and TopEdge values in each IntuiText structure are added to these to determine the final position of the text. IntuiText objects may also be drawn indirectly by attaching them to gadgets, menus or requesters. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
