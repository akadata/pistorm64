Amiga® RKM Libraries: 5 Intuition Gadgets ]" border=0> This chapter describes the multi-purpose software controls called gadgets. Gadgets are software controls symbolized by an image that the user can operate with the mouse or keyboard. They are the Amiga's equivalent of buttons, knobs and dials. Much of the user's input to an application takes place through gadgets in the application's windows and requesters. Gadgets are also used by Intuition itself for handling screen and window movement and depth arrangement, as well as window sizing and closing. Intuition maintains gadget imagery, watches for activation and deactivation and performs other management required by the gadget. The application can choose its level of involvement from simply receiving gadget activation messages to processing the actual mouse button presses and movements. To make gadget programming even easier, Release 2 of the Amiga operating system includes the new GadTools library. Applications written for Release 2 should take advantage of this new library (described separately in the " GadTools Library " chapter).
