5 / / Custom String Editing / The SGH_CLICK Command ]" border=0> The SGH_CLICK command indicates that the user has clicked the select button of the mouse within the gadget select box. There are no parameters following the SGH_CLICK command longword. Intuition will have already calculated the mouse position character cell and placed that value in SGWork.BufferPos . The previous BufferPos value remains in the SGWork . StringInfo.BufferPos . Intuition will again use the SGWork fields listed above for SGH_KEY . That is, the WorkBuffer , NumChars , BufferPos and LongInt fields values may be modified by the hook and are used by Intuition if SGA_USE is set when the hook returns. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
