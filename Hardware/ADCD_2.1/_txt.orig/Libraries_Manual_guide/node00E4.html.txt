3 / / Creating A New Custom Screen / Closing the Screen ]" border=0> When an application has finished using a screen, the memory that the screen occupied should be returned to the system by calling CloseScreen() . Normally, an application should close only those screens that it created. Under V34 and earlier versions of the OS, CloseScreen() returns no values. Under Release 2, CloseScreen() returns a boolean value, TRUE for success and FALSE for failure. CloseScreen() can fail if the screen is public and another task is still using the screen.
