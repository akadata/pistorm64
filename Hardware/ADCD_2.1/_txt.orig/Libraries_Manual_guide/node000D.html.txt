1 / Programming in the Amiga Environment / Libraries of Functions ]" border=0> Most of the routines that make up the Amiga's operating system are organized into groups called libraries. In order to call a function on the Amiga you must first open the library that contains the function. For example, if you want to call the Read() function to read data from disk you must first open the DOS library. The system's master library, called Exec , is always open. Exec keeps track of all the other libraries and is in charge of opening and closing them. One Exec function, OpenLibrary() , is used to open all the other libraries. Almost any program you write for the Amiga will have to call the OpenLibrary() function. Usage is as follows: struct Library *LibBase; /* Global: declare this above main() */ main() { LibBase = OpenLibrary("library.name",version); if(!LibBase) { /* Library did not open, so exit */ } else { /* Library opened, so use its functions */ } } LibBase This is a pointer to the library structure in memory, often referred to as the library base. The library base must be global because the system uses it to handle the library's function calls. The name of this pointer is established by the system (you cannot use any name you want). Refer to the list below for the appropriate name. library.name This is a C string that describes the name of the library you wish to open. The list of Amiga library names is given below. version This should be set to the earliest acceptable library version . A value of 0 matches any version. A value of 33 means you require at least version 33, or a later version of the library. If the library version in the system is older than the one you specify, OpenLibrary() will fail (return 0). The following table shows all the function libraries that are currently part of the Amiga system software. Column one shows the name string to use with OpenLibrary() ; column two shows the name of the global variable you should use to hold the pointer to the library; column three shows the oldest version of the library still in use.
