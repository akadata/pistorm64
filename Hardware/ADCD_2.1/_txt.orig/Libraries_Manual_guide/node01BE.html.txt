8 / Creating Images / Picking Bitplanes for Image Display ]" border=0> A single image may be displayed in different colors without changing the underlying image data. This is done by selecting which of the target bitplanes are to receive the image data, and what to do with the target bitplanes that do not receive any image data. PlanePick and PlaneOnOff are used to control the bitplane rendering of the image. The bits in each of these variables have a direct correspondence to the bitplanes of the target bitmap. The lowest bit position corresponds to the lowest numbered bitplane, the next highest bit position corresponds to the next bitplane, etc. For example, for a window or screen with three bitplanes (consisting of planes 0, 1, and 2), all the possible values for PlanePick or PlaneOnOff and the planes picked are as follows: __________________________________ | | | PlanePick or | | PlaneOnOff Planes Picked | | ------------ ------------- | | 000 No planes | | 001 Plane 0 | | 010 Plane 1 | | 011 Planes 0 and 1 | | 100 Plane 2 | | 101 Planes 0 and 2 | | 110 Planes 1 and 2 | | 111 Planes 0, 1, and 2 | |__________________________________| PlanePick picks the bitplanes of the containing RastPort that will receive the bitplanes of the image. For each plane that is picked to receive data, the next successive plane of image data is drawn there. For example, if an image with two bitplanes is drawn into a window with four bitplanes with a PlanePick of binary 1010, the first bitplane of the image will be drawn into the second bitplane of the window and the second bitplane of the image will be drawn into the fourth bitplane of the window. Do not set more bits in PlanePick than there are bitplanes in the image data. PlaneOnOff specifies what to do with the bitplanes that are not picked to receive image data. If the PlaneOnOff bit is zero, then the associated bitplane will be filled with zeros. If the PlaneOnOff bit is one, then the associated bitplane will be filled with ones. Of course, only bits that fall within the rectangle defined by the image are affected by this manipulation. Only the bits not set in PlanePick are used in PlaneOnOff , that is, PlaneOnOff only applies to those bitplanes not picked to receive image data. For example, if PlanePick is 1010 and PlaneOnOff is 1100, then PlaneOnOff may be viewed as x1x0 (where the x positions are not taken into consideration). In this case, planes two and four would receive image data and planes one and three would be set by PlaneOnOff. Each bit in plane one would be set to zero and each bit in plane three would be set to one. PlaneOnOff is only useful where an entire bitplane of an image may be set to the same value. If the bitplane is not all set to the same value, even for just a few bits, then image data must be specified for that plane. A simple trick to create a filled rectangle of any color may be used by supplying no image data, where the color is controlled by PlaneOnOff . The Depth of such an image is set to zero, the size of the rectangle is specified in the Width and Height fields and the ImageData pointer may be NULL. PlanePick should be set to zero, as there are no planes of image data to pick. PlaneOnOff is then set to the color register which contains the desired color for the rectangle.
