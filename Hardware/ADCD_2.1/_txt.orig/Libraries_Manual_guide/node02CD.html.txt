21 / Processor and Cache Control / Cache Functions ]" border=0> As of the MC68020 all processors have an instruction cache, 256 bytes on the MC68020 and MC68030 and 4 KBytes on a MC68040 . The MC68030 and MC68040 have data caches as well, 256 bytes and 4 KBytes respectively. All the processors load instructions ahead of the program counter (PC), albeit it that the MC68000 and MC68010 only prefetch one and two words respectively. This means the CPU loads instructions ahead of the current program counter. For this reason self-modifying code is strongly discouraged. If your code modifies or decrypts itself just ahead of the program counter, the pre-fetched instructions may not match the modified instructions. If self-modifying code must be used, flushing the cache is the safest way to prevent this. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
