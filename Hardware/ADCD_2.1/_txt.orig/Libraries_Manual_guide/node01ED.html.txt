10 / The Pointer / Custom Pointer ]" border=0> An application can set a custom pointer for a window to replace the default pointer. This custom pointer will be displayed whenever the window is the active one. To place a custom pointer in a window, call SetPointer() . void SetPointer( struct Window *window, UWORD *pointer, long height, long width, long xOffset, long yOffset ); Set the window argument to the address of the window that is to receive this custom pointer definition. The pointer argument is the address of the data that defines the custom pointer image. The format of this data is discussed in the next section, " The Sprite Data Structure ". The height and width specify the dimensions of the pointer sprite. There is no height restriction but the width of the sprite must be less than or equal to 16. The xOffset and yOffset are used to offset the top left corner of the hardware sprite imagery from what Intuition regards as the current position of the pointer. Another way of describing this is the offset of the default Intuition pointer hot spot from the top left corner of the sprite. For instance, by specifying offsets of (0,0), the top left corner of the sprite image will be placed at the pointer position. On the other hand, specifying an xOffset of -7 (remember, sprites are 16 pixels wide) will center the sprite over the pointer position. Specifying an xOffset of -15 will place the right edge of the sprite will be over the pointer position. Specifying the Hot Spot. ------------------------ For compatibility, the application must specify that the "hot spot" of the pointer is one pixel to the left of the desired position. Changes to the pointer done by a program must compensate for this. The Preferences Pointer editor correctly handles this situation. To remove the custom pointer from the window, call ClearPointer() . void ClearPointer( struct Window *window ); Set the window argument to the address of the window that is to have its custom pointer definition cleared. The pointer will be restored to the default Intuition pointer imagery SetPointer() and ClearPointer() take effect immediately if the window is active, otherwise, the change will only be displayed when the window is made active.
