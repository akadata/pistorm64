utility.library/Strnicmp ]" border=0> NAME Strnicmp-- Case-insensitive string compare, length-limited. (V37) SYNOPSIS res = Strnicmp(string1, string2, length) D0 A0 A1 D0 LONG Strnicmp(char *, char *, LONG length); FUNCTION Strnicmp compares two strings, ignoring case. It handles all internationalization issues. If the strings have different lengths, the shorter is treated as if it were extended with zeros. It never compares more than characters. INPUTS string1, string2 - strings to be compared length - maximum number of characters to examine RESULT res - negative if string1 is below string2, 0 if they're the same, and positive if string1 is above string2. NOTES Commodore is planning a localization library which will take care of most details pertaining to system integration into different cultures, locales, and territories. This function will automatically be replaced by a localized version whenever the locale.library is loaded in memory. As such, the collating order may change depending on the locale currently defined by the user. Take this fact into consideration when using this function, and do not rely on obtaining specific collating sequences. BUGS SEE ALSO Stricmp() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
