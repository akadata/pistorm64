(V36) SYNOPSIS error = CxObjError(co); A0 LONG CxObjError(CxObj *); FUNCTION When a function acting on an object fails, it records the failure in the object. This function returns the accumulated error value. The values are represented by flag bits defined in . Several errors may be recorded by multiple bits in 'error'. The currently defined errors are: COERR_ISNULL The value of parameter 'co' was in fact NULL. This error means "the problem with the object you inquire about is that it failed to be created." COERR_NULLATTACH Using the commodities' list manipulation functions, an attempt was made to add a NULL object to the list belonging to 'co'. This allows a line of code as follows to exist in an error-tolerant program: AttachCxObj(filter,CxSender(myport,MY_ID)); COERR_BADFILTER The most recent filter specification for a filter object was faulty. This happens if no sense can be made out of a description string, or if an input expression (IX) has an invalid format or version byte. When this bit is set in a filter's error field, the filter will match nothing, but this is not the proper way to "turn off" a filter, use ActivateCxObj() . COERR_BADTYPE A type specific operation, such as SetFilterIX() , was called for object 'co', but 'co' isn't of the proper type. INPUTS co - the commodity object to get the accumulated error from RESULTS error - the accumulated error SEE ALSO SetFilter() , SetFilterIX() , AttachCxObj() , ActivateCxObj() , ClearCxObjError() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
