iffparse.library/FreeLocalItem ]" border=0> NAME FreeLocalItem -- Deallocate a local context item structure. SYNOPSIS FreeLocalItem (lci) a0 struct LocalContextItem *lci; FUNCTION Frees the memory for the local context item and any associated user memory as allocated with AllocLocalItem . User purge vectors should call this function after they have freed any other resources associated with this item. Note that FreeLocalItem() does NOT call the custom purge vector set up through SetLocalItemPurge(); all it does is free the local context item. (This implies that your custom purge vector would want to call this to ultimately free the LocalContextItem.) (This description still seems muddy; how to clear it up?) INPUTS lci - pointer to LocalContextItem created with AllocLocalItem . RESULT EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO AllocLocalItem() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
