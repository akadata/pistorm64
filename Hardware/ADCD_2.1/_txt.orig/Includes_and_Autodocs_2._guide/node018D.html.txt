icon.library/PutDefDiskObject ]" border=0> NAME PutDefDiskObject - write disk object as the default for its type. (V36) SYNOPSIS status = PutDefDiskObject(diskobj) D0 A0 BOOL PutDefDiskObject(struct DiskObject *); FUNCTION This routine writes out a DiskObject structure, and its associated information. If the call fails, a zero will be returned. The reason for the failure may be obtained via IoErr() . Note that this function calls PutDiskObject internally which means that this call (if sucessful) notifies workbench than an icon has been created/modified. Using this routine protects you from any future changes to the way default icons are stored within the system. INPUTS diskobj -- a pointer to a DiskObject RESULTS status -- TRUE if the call succeeded else FALSE SEE ALSO GetDefDiskObject BUGS None [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
