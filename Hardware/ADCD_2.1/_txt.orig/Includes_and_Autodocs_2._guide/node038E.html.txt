layers.library/BeginUpdate ]" border=0> NAME BeginUpdate -- Prepare to repair damaged layer. SYNOPSIS result = BeginUpdate( l ) d0 a0 LONG BeginUpdate( struct Layer *); FUNCTION Convert damage list to ClipRect list and swap in for programmer to redraw through. This routine simulates the ROM library environment. The idea is to only render in the "damaged" areas, saving time over redrawing all of the layer. The layer is locked against changes made by the layer library. INPUTS l - pointer to a layer RESULTS result - TRUE if damage list converted to ClipRect list sucessfully. FALSE if list conversion aborted. (probably out of memory) BUGS If BeginUpdate returns FALSE, programmer must abort the attempt to refresh this layer and instead call EndUpdate( l, FALSE ) to restore original ClipRect and damage list.
