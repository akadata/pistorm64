(V36) SYNOPSIS count = ReadPixelArray8(rp,xstart,ystart,xstop,ystop,array,temprp) D0 A0 D0:16 D1:16 D2:16 D3:16 A2 A1 LONG ReadPixelArray8(struct RastPort *, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD, UBYTE *, struct RastPort *); FUNCTION For each pixel in a rectangular region, combine the bits from each of the bit-planes used to describe a particular RastPort into the pen number selector which that bit combination normally forms for the system hardware selection of pixel color. INPUTS rp - pointer to a RastPort structure (xstart,ystart) - starting point in the RastPort (xstop,ystop) - stopping point in the RastPort array - pointer to an array of ubytes from which to fetch the pixel data allocate at least ((((width+15)>>4) Layer set == NULL, temporary memory allocated for temprp->BitMap with Rows set == 1, temprp->BytesPerRow == (((width+15)>>4) BitMap->Planes[]) RESULT For each pixel in the array: Pen - (0..255) number at that position is returned count - the number of pixels read. NOTE xstop must be >= xstart ystop must be >= ystart BUGS SEE ALSO ReadPixel() ReadPixelLine8() graphics/rastport.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
