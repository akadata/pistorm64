It returns the slot number of the start of the expansion memory. The EC_MEMADDR macro may be used to convert this to a memory address. Boards that fit the expansion architecture have alignment rules. Normally a board must be on a binary boundary of its size. Four and Eight megabyte boards have special rules. User defined boards might have other special rules. If AllocExpansionMem() succeeds, the startSlot will satisfy the following equation: (startSlot - slotOffset) MOD slotAlign = 0 INPUTS numSlots - the number of slots required. slotOffset - an offset from that boundary for startSlot. RESULTS startSlot - the slot number that was allocated, or -1 for error. EXAMPLES AllocExpansionMem( 2, 0 ) Tries to allocate 2 slots on a two slot boundary. AllocExpansionMem( 64, 32 ) This is the allocation rule for 4 meg boards. It allocates 4 megabytes (64 slots) on an odd 2 meg boundary.
