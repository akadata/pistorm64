SYNOPSIS error = WriteChunkBytes (iff, buf, size) d0 a0 a1 d0 LONG error; struct IFFHandle *iff; UBYTE *buf; LONG size; FUNCTION Writes "size" bytes from the specified buffer into the current chunk. If the current chunk was pushed with IFFSIZE_UNKNOWN, the size of the chunk gets increased by the size of the buffer written. If the size was specified for this chunk, attempts to write past the end of the chunk will be truncated. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct. buf - pointer to buffer area with bytes to be written. size - number of bytes to write. RESULT error - (positive) number of bytes written if successful or a (negative) IFFERR_#? error code if not successful.
