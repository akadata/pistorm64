SYNOPSIS byte = ReadExpansionByte( board, offset ) D0 A0 D0 FUNCTION (Not typically called by user code) ReadExpansionByte reads a byte from a new-style expansion board. These boards have their readable data organized as a series of nybbles in memory. This routine reads two nybbles and returns the byte value. In general, this routine will only be called by ReadExpansionRom . The offset is a byte offset, as if into a ExpansionRom structure. The actual memory address read will be four times larger. The macros EROFFSET and ECOFFSET are provided to help get these offsets from C. INPUTS board - a pointer to the base of a new style expansion board. offset - a logical offset from the board base RESULTS byte - a byte of data from the expansion board. EXAMPLES byte = ReadExpansionByte( cd->BoardAddr, EROFFSET( er_Type ) ); ints = ReadExpansionByte( cd->BoardAddr, ECOFFSET( ec_Interrupt ) ); SEE ALSO WriteExpansionByte , ReadExpansionRom [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
