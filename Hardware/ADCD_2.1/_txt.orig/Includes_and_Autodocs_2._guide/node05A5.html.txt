(V36) SYNOPSIS AppIcon = AddAppIconA(id, userdata, text, msgport, D0 D0 D1 A0 A1 lock, diskobj, taglist) A2 A3 A4 struct AppIcon *AddAppIconA(ULONG, ULONG, char *, struct MsgPort *, struct FileLock *, struct DiskObject *, struct TagItem *); Alternate, varargs version: struct AppIcon *AddAppIcon(ULONG, ULONG, char *, struct MsgPort *, struct FileLock *, struct DiskObject *, tag1, data1, tag2, data2, ... TAG_END ); FUNCTION Attempt to add an icon to workbench's list of appicons. If successful, the icon is displayed on the workbench (the same place disk icons are displayed). This call is provided to allow applications to be notified when a graphical object (non neccessarely associated with a file) gets 'manipulated'. (explained later). The notification consists of an AppMessage (found in workbench.h/i) of type 'MTYPE_APPICON' arriving at the message port you specified. The types of 'manipulation' that can occur are: 1. Double-clicking on the icon. am_NumArgs will be zero and am_ArgList will be NULL. 2. Dropping an icon or icons on your appicon. am_NumArgs will be the number of icons droppped on your app icon plus one. am_ArgList will be an array of ptrs to WBArg structures. Refer to the 'WBStartup Message' section of the RKM for more info. 3. Dropping your appicon on another icon. NOT SUPPORTED. INPUTS id - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by workbench. Typical uses in C are in switch and case statements, and in assembly language table lookup. userdata - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by workbench. text - name of icon (char *) lock - NULL (Currently unused) msgport - pointer to message port workbench will use to send you an AppMessage message of type 'MTYPE_APPICON' when your icon gets 'manipulted' (explained above). diskobj - pointer to a DiskObject structure filled in as follows: do_Magic - NULL do_Version - NULL do_Gadget - a gadget structure filled in as follows: NextGadget - NULL LeftEdge - NULL TopEdge - NULL Width - width of icon hit-box Height - height of icon hit-box Flags - NULL or GADGHIMAGE Activation - NULL GadgetType - NULL GadgetRender - pointer to Image structure filled in as follows: LeftEdge - NULL TopEdge - NULL Width - width of image (must be [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
