SYNOPSIS MakeScreen( Screen ) A0 VOID MakeScreen( struct Screen * ); FUNCTION This procedure allows you to do a MakeVPort() for the viewport of your custom screen in an Intuition-integrated way. This way you can do your own screen manipulations without worrying about interference with Intuition's usage of the same viewport. The operation of this function is as follows: - Block until the Intuition View structure is not in being changed. - Set the view modes correctly to reflect if there is a (visible) interlaced screen. - call MakeVPort() , passing the Intuition View and your screen's ViewPort . - Unlocks the Intuition View . After calling this routine, you should call RethinkDisplay() to incorporate the new viewport of your custom screen into the Intuition display. NOTE: Intuition may determine that because of a change in global interlace needs that all viewports need to be remade, so it may effectively call RemakeDisplay() . INPUTS Screen = address of the custom screen structure RESULT None BUGS SEE ALSO RethinkDisplay() , RemakeDisplay() , graphics.library/MakeVPort() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
