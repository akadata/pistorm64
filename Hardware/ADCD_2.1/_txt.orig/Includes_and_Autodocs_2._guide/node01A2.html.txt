commodities.library/CxBroker ]" border=0> NAME CxBroker -- create a commodity broker. (V36) SYNOPSIS broker = CxBroker(nb,error); A0 D0 CxObj *CxBroker(struct NewBroker *,LONG *); FUNCTION This function creates a broker from the specification found in the NewBroker structure pointed to by 'nb'. The purpose and meaning of the fields of the NewBroker structure are described below. Also see for more info. struct NewBroker { BYTE nb_Version; BYTE *nb_Name; BYTE *nb_Title; BYTE *nb_Descr; SHORT nb_Unique; BYTE nb_Pri; struct MsgPort *nb_Port; WORD nb_ReservedChannel; }; nb_Version This is the way that future versions of commodities.library can identify which version of the NewBroker structure you are using. This should be set to NB_VERSION, defined in nb_Name This is the name of the broker. This name is used to find the broker in the Commodities Object List and is the name shown in the list gadget of the Exchange program. The name string is copied in the broker object upon creation, so this string can be discarded right after CxBroker() returns. The maximum length of the name string is defined by a constant in . nb_Title, nb_Descr These are two strings which appear to the user in the Exchange program and describe the application the broker is representing. Note that these strings are copied into the broker object. The maximum length of these strings that will be recognized are defined by constants in . nb_Unique This field indicates what should happen if a broker of the same name (nb_Name) already exists in the Commodities Object List . Constants in allow the caller to specify whether another broker is to be created, and whether any existing broker of the same name should be notified that an attempt at creating a duplicate has been made. nb_Pri This specifies with what priority the new broker is to be inserted within the Commodities Object List . Higher priority nodes appear earlier in a list. See for guidelines for priorities of different types of applications. It is strongly recommended that the ToolTypes environment of an application be used to allow the end-user to set the priority of the broker. INPUTS nb - an initialized NewBroker structure error - a pointer to a longword where to store a failure code, this may be NULL RESULTS broker - a pointer to the broker object or NULL upon failure. If the 'error' is not NULL, a further diagnostic code is placed at that address. Error codes are in and include: CBERR_OK No problems; broker created OK. CBERR_SYSERR System problems, not your fault. Sign of low memory or big problems. CBERR_DUP The nb_Unique field specified that only one broker of 'nb_Name' should be allowed, and one already exists. CBERR_VERSION The version specified in 'nb_Version' is unknown to the library. SEE ALSO SetCxObjPri() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
