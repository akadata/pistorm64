(V36) SYNOPSIS TextExtent(rp, string, count, textExtent) A1 A0 D0:16 A2 void TextExtent(struct RastPort *, STRPTR, WORD, struct TextExtent *); FUNCTION This function determines a more complete metric of the space that a text string would render into than the TextLength() function. INPUTS rp - a pointer to the RastPort which describes where the text attributes reside. string - the address of the string to determine the length of. count - the number of characters in the string. If zero, there are no characters in the string. textExtent - a structure to hold the result. RESULTS textExtent is filled in as follows: te_Width - same as TextLength() result: the rp_cp_x advance that rendering this text would cause. te_Height - same as tf_YSize. The height of the font. te_Extent.MinX - the offset to the left side of the rectangle this would render into. Often zero. te_Extent.MinY - same as -tf_Baseline. The offset from the baseline to the top of the rectangle this would render into. te_Extent.MaxX - the offset of the left side of the rectangle this would render into. Often the same as te_Width-1. te_Extent.MaxY - same as tf_YSize-tf_Baseline-1. The offset from the baseline to the bottom of the rectanangle this would render into.
