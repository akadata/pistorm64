(V36) SYNOPSIS AddIEvents(events) A0 VOID AddIEvents(struct InputEvent *); FUNCTION This function adds a null-terminated linked list of input events to the input stream of commodities. It is a touch easier than using the input device directly. The contents of the input events are copied into commodity messages, so they may be disposed of as soon as this call returns. The messages are initially routed to the first broker in the Commodities Object List . INPUTS events - the list of input events to add SEE ALSO cx_lib/FreeIEvents() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
