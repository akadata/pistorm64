audio.device/Expunge ]" border=0> NAME EXPUNGE - indicate a desire to remove the Audio device FUNCTION The Expunge routine is called when a user issues a RemDevice call. By the time it is called, the device has already been removed from the device list, so no new opens will succeed. The existence of any other users of the device, as determined by the device open count being non-zero, will cause the Expunge to be deferred. When the device is not in use, or no longer in use, the Expunge is actually performed. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
