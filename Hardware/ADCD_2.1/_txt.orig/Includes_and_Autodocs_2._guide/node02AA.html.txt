dos.library/Flush ]" border=0> NAME Flush -- Flushes buffers for a buffered filehandle (V36) SYNOPSIS success = Flush(fh) D0 D1 LONG Flush(BPTR) FUNCTION Flushes any pending buffered writes to the filehandle. All buffered writes will also be flushed on Close() . If the filehandle was being used for input, it drops the buffer, and tries to Seek() back to the last read position (so subsequent reads or writes will occur at the expected position in the file). INPUTS fh - Filehandle to flush. RESULT success - Success or failure. BUGS Before V37 release, Flush() returned a random value. As of V37, it always returns success (this will be fixed in some future release). SEE ALSO FputC(), FGetC() , UnGetC() , Seek() , Close() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
