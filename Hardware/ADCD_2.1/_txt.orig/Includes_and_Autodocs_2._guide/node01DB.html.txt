iffparse.library/StopOnExit ]" border=0> NAME StopOnExit -- Declare a stop condition for exiting a chunk. SYNOPSIS error = StopOnExit (iff, type, id) d0 a0 d0 d1 LONG error; struct IFFHandle *iff; LONG type; LONG id; FUNCTION Installs an exit handler for the specified chunk which will cause the ParseIFF() function to return control to the caller when this chunk is exhausted. ParseIFF() will return IFFERR_EOC when the declared chunk is about to be popped. This is only of value when ParseIFF() is called with the IFFPARSE_SCAN control code. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct (need not be open). type - type code for chunk to declare (ex. "ILBM"). id - identifier for chunk to declare (ex. "BODY"). RESULT error - 0 if successful or an IFFERR_#? error code if not successful. EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO ParseIFF() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
