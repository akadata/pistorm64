SYNOPSIS lci = FindLocalItem (iff, type, id, ident) d0 a0 d0 d1 d2 struct LocalContextItem *lci; struct IFFHandle *iff; LONG type, id, ident; FUNCTION Searches the context stack of the given IFFHandle struct for a local context item which matches the given ident, type and id. This function searches the context stack from the most current context backwards, so that the item found (if any) will be the one with greatest precedence in the context stack. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct. type - type code to search for. id - ID code to search for. ident - ident code for the class of context item to search for (ex. "exhd" -- exit handler). RESULT lci - pointer local context item if found, or NULL if nothing matched. EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS It really should have some sort of wildcarding capability.
