7 Keyboard Device / Reading Keyboard Events ]" border=0> Reading keyboard events is normally not done through direct access to the keyboard device. (Higher level devices such as the input device and console device are available for this. See the chapter Input Device for more information on the intimate linkage between the input device and the keyboard device.) This section is provided primarily to show you the component parts of a keyboard input event. The keyboard matrix figure shown at the beginning of this chapter gives the code value that each key places into the ie_Code field of the input event for a key-down event. For a key-up event, a value of hexadecimal 80 is or'ed with the value shown above. Additionally, if either shift key is down, or if the key is one of those in the numeric keypad, the qualifier field of the keyboard input event will be filled in accordingly. In V34 and earlier versions of Kickstart, the keyboard device does not set the numeric qualifier for the keypad keys "(", ")", "/", "*" and "+". When you ask to read events from the keyboard, the call will not be satisfied until at least one keyboard event is available to be returned. The io_Length field must contain the number of bytes available in io_Data to insert events into. Thus, you should use a multiple of the number of bytes in an InputEvent (see example below). Type-Ahead Processing. ---------------------- The keyboard device can queue up several keystrokes without a task requesting a report of keyboard events. However, when the keyboard event buffer has been filled with no task interaction, additional keystrokes will be discarded. Example Read Keyboard Event Program [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
