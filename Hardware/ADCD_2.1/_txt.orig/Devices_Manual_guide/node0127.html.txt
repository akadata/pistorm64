8 Narrator Device / A More Technical Explanation ]" border=0> The narrator speech synthesizer is a computer model of the human speech production process. It attempts to produce accurately spoken utterances of any English sentence, given only a phonetic representation as input. Another program in the Amiga speech system, the translator device, derives the required phonetic spelling from English text. Timing and pitch contours are produced automatically by the synthesizer software. In humans, the physical act of producing speech sounds begins in the lungs. To create a voiced sound, the lungs force air through the vocal folds (commonly called the vocal cords), which are held under tension and which periodically interrupt the flow of air, thus creating a buzz-like sound. This buzz, which has a spectrum rich in harmonics, then passes through the vocal tract and out the lips and nose, which alters its spectrum drastically. This is because the vocal tract acts as a frequency filter, selectively reinforcing some harmonics and suppressing others. It is this filtering that gives a speech sound its identity. The amplitude versus frequency graph of the filtering action is called the vocal tract transfer function. Changing the shape of the throat, tongue, and mouth retunes the filter system to accentuate different frequencies. The sound travels as a pressure wave through the air, and it causes the listener's eardrum to vibrate. The ear and brain of the listener decode the incoming frequency pattern. From this the listener can subconsciously make a judgement about what physical actions were performed by the speaker to make the sound. Thus the speech chain is completed, the speaker having encoded his physical actions on a buzz via selective filtering and the listener having turned the sound into guesses about physical actions by frequency decoding. Now that we know how humans produce speech, how does the Amiga do it? It turns out that the vocal tract transfer function is not random, but tends to accentuate energy in narrow bands called formants. The formant positions move fairly smoothly as we speak, and it is the formant frequencies to which our ears are sensitive. So, luckily, we do not have to model throat, tongue, teeth and lips with our computer, we can imitate formant actions instead. A good representation of speech requires up to five formants, but only the lowest three are required for intelligibility. The pre-V37 Narrator had only three formants, while the V37 Narrator has five formants for a more natural sounding voice. We begin with an oscillator that produces a waveform similar to that which is produced by the vocal folds, and we pass it through a series of resonators, each tuned to a different formant frequency. By controlling the volume and pitch of the oscillator and the frequencies of the resonators, we can produce highly intelligible and natural-sounding speech. Of course the better the model the better the speech; but more importantly, experience has shown that the better the control of the model's parameters, the better the speech. Oscillators, volume controls, and resonators can all be simulated mathematically in software, and it is by this method that the narrator system operates. The input phonetic string is converted into a series of target values for the various parameters. A system of rules then operates on the string to determine things such as the duration of each phoneme and the pitch contour. Transitions between target values are created and smoothed to produce natural, continuous changes from one sound to the next. New values are computed for each parameter for every 8 milliseconds of speech, which produces about 120 acoustic changes per second. These values drive a mathematical model of the speech synthesizer. The accuracy of this simulation is quite good. Human speech has more formants that the narrator model, but they are high in frequency and low in energy content. The human speech production mechanism is a complex and wonderful thing. The more we learn about it, the better we can make our computer simulations. Meanwhile, we can use synthetic speech as yet another computer output device to enhance the man/machine dialogue. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
