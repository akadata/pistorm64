Background for Designers / Data Abstraction ]" border=0> The basic problem is how to represent information in a way that's program- independent, compiler- independent, machine-independent, and device-independent. The computer science approach is "data abstraction", also known as "objects", "actors", and "abstract data types". A data abstraction has a "concrete representation" (its storage format), an "abstract representation" (its capabilities and uses), and access procedures that isolate all the calling software from the concrete representation. Only the access procedures touch the data storage. Hiding mutable details behind an interface is called "information hiding". What is hidden are the non-portable details of implementing the object, namely the selected storage representation and algorithms for manipulating it. The power of this approach is modularity. By adjusting the access procedures we can extend and restructure the data without impacting the interface or its callers. Conversely, we can extend and restructure the interface and callers without making existing data obsolete. It's great for interchange! But we seem to need the opposite: fixed file formats for all programs to access. Actually, we could file data abstractions ("filed objects") by storing the data and access procedures together. We'd have to encode the access procedures in a standard machine-independent programming language á la PostScript. Even with this, the interface can't evolve freely since we can't update all copies of the access procedures. So we'll have to design our abstract representations for limited evolution and occasional revolution (conversion). In any case, today's microcomputers can't practically store true data abstractions. They can do the next best thing: store arbitrary types of data in "data chunks", each with a type identifier and a length count. The type identifier is a reference by name to the access procedures (any local implementation). The length count enables storage-level object operations like "copy" and "skip to next" independent of object type or contents. Chunk writing is straightforward. Chunk reading requires a trivial parser to scan each chunk and dispatch to the proper access/conversion procedure. Reading chunks nested inside other chunks may require recursion, but no look ahead or backup. That's the main idea of IFF. There are, of course, a few other details.... [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
