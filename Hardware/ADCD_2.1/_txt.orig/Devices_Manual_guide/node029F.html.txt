SAMP.doc / Filename Conventions ]" border=0> For when it becomes necessary to split a SAMP file between floppies using the Continuation feature, the filenames should be related. The method is the following: The "root" file has the name that the user chose to save under. Subsequent files have an ascii number appended to the name to indicate what sublevel the file is in. In this way, a program can reload the files in the proper order. For example, if a user saved a file called "Gurgle", the first continuation file should be named "Gurgle1", etc. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
