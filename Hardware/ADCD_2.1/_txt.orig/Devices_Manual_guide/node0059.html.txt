10 / / Writing An Alphanumeric Printer Driver / Extended Character Table ]" border=0> The 8BitChars field could contain a pointer to a table of characters for the ASCII codes $A0 to $FF. The symbols for these codes are shown in the IFF Appendix of this manual. If this field contains a NULL, it means no specific table is provided for the driver, and the default table is to be used instead. Care should be taken when generating this table because of the way the table is parsed by the printer device. Valid expressions in the table include \011 where 011 is an octal number, \\000 for null and \\n where n is a 1 to 3 digit decimal number. To enter an actual backslash in the table requires the somewhat awkward \\\\. As an example, here is a list of the first entries of the EpsonxX[CBM_MPS-1250] table: char *ExtendedCharTable[] = { " ", /* NBSP */ "\033R\007[\033R\\0", /* i */ "c\010|", /* c| */ "\033R\003#\033R\\0", /* L- */ "\033R\005$\033R\\0", /* o */ "\033R\010\\\\\033R\\0", /* Y- */ "|", /* | */ "\033R\002@\033R\\0", /* SS */ "\033R\001~\033R\\0", /* " */ "c", /* copyright */ "\033S\\0a\010_\033T", /* a_ */ " [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
