4 / Writing to the Console Device / Hints For Writing Text ]" border=0> 256 Is A Nice Round Number -------------------------- You must keep in mind that the console device locks all layers while writing text. To avoid, problems with this, it is best to send smaller rather larger numbers of character to be written. We recommend no more than 256 bytes per write as the optimum size Turn Off The Cursor ------------------- If your console is attached to a V1.2/1.3 SuperBitmap window, you will not see a cursor rendered. For output speed and compatibility with future OS versions which may visibly render the cursor, you should send the cursor-off sequence (ESC[0 p) whenever you open or reset (ESCc) a SuperBitmap window's console.
