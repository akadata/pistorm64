4 / About Console I/O / Exec Functions And The Console Device ]" border=0> The various Exec functions such as DoIO() , SendIO() , AbortIO() and CheckIO() operate normally. The only caveats are that CMD_WRITE may cause your application to wait internally, even with SendIO(), and a task using CMD_READ to wait on a response from a console is at the user's mercy. If the user never reselects that window, and the console response provides the only wake-up call, that task will sleep forever. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
