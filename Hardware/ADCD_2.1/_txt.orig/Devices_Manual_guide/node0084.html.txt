4 / Device Interface / Opening The Console Device ]" border=0> Four primary steps are required to open the console device: * Create a message port using CreatePort() . Reply messages from the device must be directed to a message port. * Create an I/O request structure of type IOStdReq . The IOStdReq structure is created by the CreateExtIO() function. CreateExtIO will initialize your I/O request to point to your reply port. * Open an Intuition window and set a pointer to it in the io_Data field of the IOStdReq and the size of the window in the io_Length field. This is the window to which the console will be attached. The window must be SIMPLE_REFRESH for use with the CONU_CHARMAP and CONU_SNIPMAP units. * Open the console device. Call OpenDevice() passing it the I/O request and the type of console unit set in the unit and flags fields. Console unit types and flag values are listed below. Console device units: * CONU_LIBRARY - Return the device library vector pointer used for calling console device functions. No console is opened. * CONU_STANDARD - Open a standard console. * CONU_CHARMAP - Open a console with a character map. * CONU_SNIPMAP - Open a console with a character map and copy-and-paste support. See the include file devices/ conunit.h for the unit definitions and the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs for an explanation of each unit. No Changes Required ------------------- CONU_STANDARD has a numeric value of zero to insure compatibility with pre-V36 applications. CONU_LIBRARY has a numeric value of negative one and is also compatible with pre-V36 applications. Console device flags: * CONFLAG_DEFAULT - The console device will redraw the window when it is resized. * CONFLAG_NODRAW_ON_NEWSIZE - The console device will not redraw the window when it is resized The character map units, CONU_CHARMAP and CONU_SNIPMAP, are the only units which use the flags parameter to set how the character map is used. CONU_STANDARD units ignore the flags parameter. See the include file devices/ conunit.h for the flag definitions and the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs for an explanation of the flags. struct MsgPort *ConsoleMP; /* Message port pointer */ struct IOStdReq *ConsIO; /* I/O structure pointer */ struct Window *win = NULL; /* Window pointer */ struct NewWindow nw = { 10, 10, /* starting position (left,top) */ 620,180, /* width, height */ -1,-1, /* detailpen, blockpen */ CLOSEWINDOW, /* flags for idcmp */ WINDOWDEPTH|WINDOWSIZING| WINDOWDRAG|WINDOWCLOSE| SIMPLE_REFRESH|ACTIVATE, /* window flags */ NULL, /* no user gadgets */ NULL, /* no user checkmark */ "Console Test", /* title */ NULL, /* pointer to window screen */ NULL, /* pointer to super bitmap */ 100,45, /* min width, height */ 640,200, /* max width, height */ WBENCHSCREEN /* open on workbench screen */ }; /* Create reply port console */ if (!(ConsoleMP = CreatePort("RKM.Console",0))) cleanexit("Can't create write port\n",RETURN_FAIL); /* Create message block for device I/O */ if (!(ConsIO = CreateExtIO(ConsoleMP,sizeof(struct IOStdReq)))) cleanexit("Can't create IORequest\n",RETURN_FAIL); /* Open a window - we assume intuition.library is already open */ if (!(win = OpenWindow(&nw))) cleanexit("Can't open window\n",RETURN_FAIL); /* Set window pointer and size in I/O request */ ConsIO->io_Data = (APTR) win; ConsIO->io_Length = sizeof(struct Window); /* Open the console device */ if (error = OpenDevice("console.device",CONU_CHARMAP,ConsIO, CONFLAG_DEFAULT)) cleanexit("Can't open console.device\n",RETURN_FAIL); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
