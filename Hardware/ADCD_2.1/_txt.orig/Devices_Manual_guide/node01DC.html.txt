Primitive Data Types / Type IDs ]" border=0> A "type ID", "property name", "FORM type", or any other IFF identifier is a 32-bit value: the concatenation of four ASCII characters in the range " " (SP, hex 20) through '~' (hex 7E). Spaces (hex 20) should not precede printing characters; trailing spaces are OK. Control characters are forbidden. typedef CHAR ID[4]; IDs are compared using a simple 32-bit case-dependent equality test. FORM type IDs are restricted. Since they may be stored in filename extensions lower case letters and punctuation marks are forbidden. Trailing spaces are OK. Carefully choose those four characters when you pick a new ID. Make them mnemonic so programmers can look at an interchange format file and figure out what kind of data it contains. The name space makes it possible for developers scattered around the globe to generate ID values with minimal collisions so long as they choose specific names like "MUS4" instead of general ones like "TYPE" and "FILE". Commodore Applications and Technical Support has undertaken the task of maintaining the registry of FORM type IDs and format descriptions. See the IFF Registry document for more information. Sometimes it's necessary to make data format changes that aren't backward compatible. As much as we work for compatibility, unintended interactions can develop. Since IDs are used to denote data formats in IFF, new IDs are chosen to denote revised formats. Since programs won't read chunks whose IDs they don't recognize (see Chunks , below), the new IDs keep old programs from stumbling over new data. The conventional way to chose a "revision" ID is to increment the last character if it's a digit or else change the last character to a digit. E.g., first and second revisions of the ID "XY" would be "XY1" and "XY2". Revisions of " CMAP " would be "CMA1" and "CMA2". [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
