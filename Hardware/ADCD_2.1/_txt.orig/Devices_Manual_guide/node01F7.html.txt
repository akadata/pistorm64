Appendix A. Reference / Type Definitions ]" border=0> The following C typedefs describe standard IFF structures. Declarations to use in practice will vary with the CPU and compiler. For example, 68000 Lattice C produces efficient comparison code if we define ID as a "LONG". A macro "MakeID" builds these IDs at compile time. /* Standard IFF types, expressed in 68000 Lattice C. */ typedef unsigned char UBYTE; /* 8 bits unsigned */ typedef short WORD; /* 16 bits signed */ typedef unsigned short UWORD; /* 16 bits unsigned */ typedef long LONG; /* 32 bits signed */ typedef char ID[4]; /* 4 chars in " " through "~" */ typedef struct { ID ckID; LONG ckSize; /* sizeof(ckData) */ UBYTE ckData[/* ckSize */]; } Chunk; /* ID typedef and builder for 68000 Lattice C. */ typedef LONG ID; /* 4 chars in " " through "~" */ #define MakeID(a,b,c,d) ( (a) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
