8 / How to Write Phonetically for Narrator / Stress And Intonation ]" border=0> It is not enough to tell narrator what you want said. For the best results you must also tell narrator how you want it said. In this way you can alter a sentence's meaning, stress important words, and specify the proper accents in polysyllabic words. These things improve the naturalness and thus the intelligibility of the spoken output. Stress and intonation are specified by the single digits 1-9 following a vowel phoneme code. Stress and intonation are two different things, but are specified by a single number. Stress is, among other things, the elongation of a syllable. A syllable is either stressed or not, so the presence of a number after the vowel in a syllable indicates stress on that syllable. The value of the number indicates the intonation. These numbers are referred to here as stress marks but keep in mind that they also affect intonation. Intonation here means the pitch pattern or contour of an utterance. The higher the stress mark, the higher the potential for an accent in pitch. A sentence's basic contour is comprised of a quickly rising pitch gesture up to the first stressed syllable in the sentence, followed by a slowly declining tone throughout the sentence, and finally, a quick fall to a low pitch on the last syllable. The presence of additional stressed syllables causes the pitch to break its slow, declining pattern with rises and falls around each stressed syllable. Narrator uses a very sophisticated procedure to generate natural pitch contours based on how you mark the stressed syllables. How and Where to Put the Stress Marks Which Stress Value Do I Use?
