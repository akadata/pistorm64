Additional Info / How Amiga HAM mode works ]" border=0> Amiga HAM (Hold and Modify) mode lets the Amiga display all 4096 RGB values. In HAM mode, the bits in the two last planes describe an R G or B modification to the color of the previous pixel on the line to create the color of the current pixel. So a 6-plane HAM picture has 4 planes for specifying absolute color pixels giving up to 16 absolute colors which would be specified in the ILBM CMAP chunk. The bits in the last two planes are color modification bits which cause the Amiga, in HAM mode, to take the RGB value of the previous pixel (Hold and), substitute the 4 bits in planes 0-3 for the previous color's R G or B component (Modify) and display the result for the current pixel. If the first pixel of a scan line is a modification pixel, it modifies the RGB value of the border color (register 0). The color modification bits in the last two planes (planes 4 and 5) are interpreted as follows: 00 - no modification. Use planes 0-3 as normal color register index 10 - hold previous, replacing Blue component with bits from planes 0-3 01 - hold previous, replacing Red component with bits from planes 0-3 11 - hold previous. replacing Green component with bits from planes 0-3 [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
