Data Sections / Composite FORMs ]" border=0> A FORM chunk inside a FORM is a full-fledged data section. This means you can build a composite object such as a multi-frame animation sequence by nesting available picture FORMs and sound effect FORMs. You can insert additional chunk s with information like frame rate and frame count. Using composite FORM s, you leverage on existing programs that create and edit the component FORMs. Those editors may even look into your composite object to copy out its type of component. Such editors are not allowed to replace their component objects within your composite object. That's because the IFF standard lets you specify consistency requirements for the composite FORM such as maintaining a count or a directory of the components. Only programs that are written to uphold the rules of your FORM type may create or modify such FORMs. Therefore, in designing a program that creates composite objects, you are strongly requested to provide a facility for your users to import and export the nested FORM s. Import and export could move the data through a clipboard or a file. Here are several existing FORM types and rules for defining new ones: FTXT ILBM PICs Other Macintosh Resource Types [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
