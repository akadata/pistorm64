The Global Drawing Attribute Chunks / LAYR ]" border=0> LAYR (0x4C415952) /* Define a layer */ A DR2D project is broken up into one or more layers. Each DR2D object is in one of these layers. Layers provide several useful features. Any particular layer can be ``turned off'', so that the objects in the layer are not displayed. This eliminates the unnecessary display of objects not currently needed on the screen. Also, the user can lock a layer to protect the layer's objects from accidental changes. struct LAYRstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; USHORT LayerID; /* ID of the layer */ char LayerName[16]; /* Null terminated and padded */ UBYTE Flags; /* Flags, from LF_*, below */ UBYTE Pad0; /* Always 0 */ }; LayerID is the number assigned to this layer. As the field's name indicates, LayerName[] is the NULL terminated name of the layer. Flags is a bit field who's bits are set according to the #defines below: #define LF_ACTIVE 0x01 /* Active for editing */ #define LF_DISPLAYED 0x02 /* Displayed on the screen */ If the LF_ACTIVE bit is set, this layer is unlocked. A set LF_DISPLAYED bit indicates that this layer is currently visible on the screen. A cleared LF_DISPLAYED bit implies that LF_ACTIVE is not set. The reason for this is to keep the user from accidentally editing layers that are invisible. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
