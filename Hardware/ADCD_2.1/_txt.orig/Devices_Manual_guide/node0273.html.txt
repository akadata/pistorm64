HEAD.doc / CHUNKS ]" border=0> CHUNK ID: NEST This chunk consists of only of a word (two byte) value that gives the new current nesting level of the outline. The initial nesting level (outermost level) is zero. It is necessary to include a NEST chunk only when the nesting level changes. Valid changes to the nesting level are either to decrease the current value by any amount (with a minimum of 0) or to increase it by one (and not more than one). CHUNK ID: TEXT This chunk is the actual text of a heading. Each heading has a TEXT chunk (even if empty). The text is not NULL terminated - the chunk size gives the length of the heading text. CHUNK ID: FSCC This chunk gives the Font/Style/Color changes in the heading from the most recent TEXT chunk. It should occur immediately after the TEXT chunk it modifies. The format is identical to the FSCC chunk for the IFF form type 'WORD' (for compatibility), except that only the 'Location' and 'Style' values are used (i.e., there can be currently only be style changes in an outline heading). The structure definition is: typedef struct { UWORD Location; /* Char location of change */ UBYTE FontNum; /* Ignored */ UBYTE Style; /* Amiga style bits */ UBYTE MiscStyle; /* Ignored */ UBYTE Color; /* Ignored */ UWORD pad; /* Ignored */ } FSCChange; The actual chunk consists of an array of these structures, one entry for each Style change in the heading text.
