14 / Disk Status Commands / Determining The Drive Type ]" border=0> You determine the drive type of a unit by passing an IOExtTD to the device with TD_GETDRIVETYPE set in io_Command. For quick I/O, you must set io_Flags to IOF_QUICK. DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Flags = IOF_QUICK; DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Command = TD_GETDRIVETYPE; BeginIO((struct IORequest *)DiskIO); TD_GETDRIVETYPE returns the drive type for the unit that was opened in io_Actual. The value will be DRIVE3_5 for 3.5" drives and DRIVE5_25 for 5.25" drives. The unit can be opened only if the device understands the drive type it is connected to. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
