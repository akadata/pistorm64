Amiga® RKM Devices: 3 Clipboard Device ]" border=0> The clipboard device allows the exchange of data dynamically between one application and another. It is responsible for caching data that has been "cut" and providing data to "paste" in an application. A special "post" mode allows an application to inform the clipboard device that the application has data available. The clipboard device will request this data only if the data is actually needed. The clipboard will cache the data in RAM and will automatically spool the data to disk if necessary. The clipboard device is implemented as an Exec-style device, and supports random access reads and writes on data within the clipboard. All data in the clipboard must be in IFF format. A new library, IFFParse Library , has been added to the Amiga libraries. The routines in iffparse.library can and should be used for reading and writing data to the clipboard. This chapter contains a brief discussion of IFF as it relates to the clipboard (for more details see Appendix A ).
