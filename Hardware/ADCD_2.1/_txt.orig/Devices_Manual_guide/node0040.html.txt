10 Printer Device / Printer Device Access ]" border=0> The printer device is totally transparent to an application. It uses information set up by the Workbench Preferences Printer and PrinterGfx tools to identify the type of printer connection (serial or parallel), type of dithering, etc. It also offers the flexibility to send raw information to the printer for special non-standard or unsupported features. Raw data transfer is not recommended for conventional text and graphics since it will result in applications that will only work with certain printers. By using the standard printer device interface, an application can perform device independent output to a printer. Don't Hog The Device. --------------------- The printer device is currently an exclusive access device. Do not tie it up needlessly. There are two ways of doing output to the printer device: * PRT:-the AmigaDOS printer device PRT: may be opened just like any other AmigaDOS file. You may send standard escape sequences to PRT: to specify the options you want as shown in the command table below. The escape sequences are interpreted by the printer driver, translated into printer-specific escape sequences and forwarded to the printer. When using PRT: the escape sequences and data must be sent as a character stream. Using PRT: is by far the easiest way of doing text output to a printer. * printer.device - to directly access the printer device itself By opening the printer device directly, you have full control over the printer. You can either send standard escape sequences as shown in the command table below or send raw characters directly to the printer with no processing at all. Doing this would be similar to sending raw characters to SER: or PAR: from AmigaDOS. (Since this interferes with device-independence it is strongly discouraged). Direct access to the printer device also allows you to transmit device I/O commands, such as reset and flush, and do a raster dump on a graphics-capable printer. Use A Stream to Escape. ----------------------- All "raw escape sequences" transmitted to the printer through the printer device must take the form of a character stream.
