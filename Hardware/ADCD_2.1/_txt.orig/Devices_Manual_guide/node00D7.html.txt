6 Input Device / Setting the Key Repeat Threshold ]" border=0> The key repeat threshold is the number of seconds and microseconds a user must hold down a key before it begins to repeat. This delay is normally set by the Preferences tool or by Intuition when it notices that the Preferences have been changed, but you can also do it directly through the input device. You set the key repeat threshold by passing a timerequest with IND_SETTHRESH set in io_Command and the number of seconds to delay set in tv_secs and the number of microseconds to delay set in tv_micro. #include struct timerequest *InputTime;/* Init with CreateExtIO() before using */ InputTime->tr_time.tv_secs=1; /* 1 second */ InputTime->tr_time.tv_micro=500000; /* 500000 microseconds */ InputTime->tr_node.io_Command=IND_SETTHRESH; DoIO((struct IORequest *)InputTime); The code above will set the key repeat threshold to 1.5 seconds.
