15 Resources / The Amiga Resources ]" border=0> There are currently seven standard resources in the Amiga system. The following lists the name of each resource and its function. battclock.resource grants access to the battery-backed clock chip. battmem.resource grants access to non-volatile RAM. cia.resource grants access to the interrupts and timer bits of the 8520 CIA (Complex Interface Adapter) chips. disk.resource grants temporary exclusive access to the disk hardware. FileSystem.resource grants access to the file system. misc.resource grants exclusive access to functional blocks of chip registers. At present, definitions have been made for the serial and parallel hardware only. potgo.resource manages the bits of the proportional I/O pins on the game controller ports. The resources allow you direct access to the hardware in a way that is compatible with multitasking. They also allow you to temporarily bar other tasks from using the resource. You may then use the associated hardware directly for your special purposes. If applicable, you must return the resource back to the system for other tasks to use when you are finished with it. See the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual for detailed information on the actual hardware involved. Look Before You Leap. --------------------- Resources are just one step above direct hardware manipulation. You are advised to try the higher level device and library approach before resorting to the hardware. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
