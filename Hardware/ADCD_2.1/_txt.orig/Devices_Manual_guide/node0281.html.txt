ILBM.DRNG.doc / Enhanced Color Cycling Capabilities ]" border=0> * DPaintIV supports a new color cycling model which does NOT require that color cycles contain a contiguous range of color registers. For example: If your range looks like: [1][3][8][2] then at each cycle tick temp = [2], [2] = [8], [8] = [3], [3] = [1], [1] = temp * You can now cycle a single register thru a series of rgb values. For example: If your range looks like: [1] [orange] [blue] [purple] then at each cycle tick color register 1 will take on the next color in the cycle. ie: t=0: [1] = curpal[1] t=1: [1] = purple t=2: [1] = blue t=3: [1] = orange t=4: goto t=0 * You can combine rgb cycling with traditional color cycling. For example: Your range can look like: [1] [orange] [blue] [2] [green] [yellow] t=0: [1] = curpal[1], [2] = curpal[2] t=1: [1] = yellow, [2] = blue t=2: [1] = green, [2] = orange t=3: [1] = curpal[2], [2] = curpal[1] t=4: [1] = blue, [2] = yellow t=5: [1] = orange, [2] = green t=6: goto t=0 Note: * DPaint will save out an old style range CRNG if the range fits the CRNG model otherwise it will save out a DRNG chunk. * no thought has been given (yet) to interlocking cycles [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
