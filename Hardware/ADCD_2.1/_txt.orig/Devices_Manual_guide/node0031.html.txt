2 / Allocation and Arbitration Commands / ADCMD_LOCK ]" border=0> The ADCMD_LOCK command performs the "steal verify" function. When another application is attempting to steal a channel or channels, ADCMD_LOCK gives you a chance to clean up before the channel is stolen. You perform a ADCMD_LOCK command right after the ADCMD_ALLOCATE command. ADCMD_LOCK does not return until a higher-priority user attempts to steal the channel(s) or you perform an ADCMD_FREE command. If someone is attempting to steal, you must finish up and ADCMD_FREE the channel as quickly as possible. You must use ADCMD_LOCK if you want to write directly to the hardware registers instead of using the device commands. If your channel is stolen, you are not notified unless the ADCMD_LOCK command is present. This could cause problems for the task that has stolen the channel and is now using it at the same time as your task. ADCMD_LOCK sets a switch that is not cleared until you perform an ADCMD_FREE command on the channel. Canceling an ADCMD_LOCK request with AbortIO() will not free the channel. The following outline describes how ADCMD_LOCK works when a channel is stolen and when it is not stolen. 1. User A allocates a channel. 2. User A locks the channel. If User B allocates the channel with a higher precedence: 3. User B's ADCMD_ALLOCATE command is suspended (regardless of the setting of the ADIOF_NOWAIT flag). 4. User A's lock command is replied to with an error (ADIOERR_CHANNELSTOLEN). 5. User A does whatever is needed to finish up when a channel is stolen. 6. User A frees the channel with ADCMD_FREE . 7. User B's ADCMD_ALLOCATE command is replied to. Now user B has the channel. Otherwise, if the channel is not allocated by another user: 3. User A finishes the sound. 4. User A performs the ADCMD_FREE command. 5. User A's ADCMD_LOCK command is replied to. Never make the freeing of a channel (if the channel is stolen) dependent on allocating another channel. This may cause a deadlock. If you want channels back after they have been stolen, you must reallocate them with the same allocation key. To keep a channel and never let it be stolen, set precedence to maximum (127). Do not use a lock for this purpose. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
