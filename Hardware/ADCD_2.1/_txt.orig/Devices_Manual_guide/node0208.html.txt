8SVX.CHAN.PAN.doc / Optional Data Chunk CHAN ]" border=0> This chunk is already written by the software for a popular stereo sampler. To maintain the ability read these samples, its implementation here is therefore limited to maintain compatability. The optional data chunk CHAN gives the information neccessary to play a sample on a specified channel, or combination of channels. This chunk would be useful for programs employing stereo recording or playback of sampled sounds. #define RIGHT 4L #define LEFT 2L #define STEREO 6L #define ID_CHAN MakeID('C','H','A','N') typedef sampletype LONG; If "sampletype" is RIGHT, the program reading the sample knows that it was originally intended to play on a channel routed to the right speaker, (channels 1 and 2 on the Amiga). If "sampletype" is LEFT, the left speaker was intended (Amiga channels 0 and 3). It is left to the discretion of the programmer to decide whether or not to play a sample when a channel on the side designated by "sampletype" cannot be allocated. If "sampletype" is STEREO, then the sample requires a pair of channels routed to both speakers (Amiga pairs [0,1] and [2,3]). The BODY chunk for stereo pairs contains both left and right information. To adhere to existing conventions, sampling software should write first the LEFT information, followed by the RIGHT. The LEFT and RIGHT information should be equal in length. Again, it is left to the programmer to decide what to do if a channel for a stereo pair can't be allocated; wether to play the available channel only, or to allocate another channels routed to the wrong speaker.
