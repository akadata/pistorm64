11 / RigidDiskBlock-Fields and Implementation / How A Driver Uses RDB ]" border=0> The information contained in the RigidDiskBlock and subsequent PartitionBlocks , et al., is used by a driver in the following manner. After determining that the target device is a hard disk (using the SCSI-direct command INQUIRY), the driver will scan the first RDB_LOCATION_LIMIT (16) blocks looking for a block with the "RDSK" identifier and a correct sum-to-zero checksum. If no RDB is found then the driver will give up and not attempt to mount any partitions for this unit. If the RDB is found then the driver looks to see if there's a partition list for this unit (rdb_PartitionList). If none, then just the rdb_Flags will be used to determine if there are any LUNs or units after this one. This is used for early termination of the search for units on bootup. If a partition list is present, and the partition blocks have the correct ID and checksum, then for each partition block the driver does the following. 1. Checks the PBFB_NOMOUNT flag. If set then this partition is just reserving space. Skip to the next partition without mounting the current one. 2. If PBFB_NOMOUNT is false, then the partition is to be mounted. The driver fetches the given drive name from pb_DriveName. This name will be of the form dh0, work, wb_2.x etc. A check is made to see if this name already exists on eb_MountList or DOS's device list. If it does, then the name is algorithmically altered to remove duplicates. The A590, A2091 and A3000 append .n (where n is a number) unless another name ending with .n is found. In that case the name is changed to .n+1 and the search for duplicates is retried. 3. Next the driver constructs a parameter packet for MakeDosNode() using the (possibly altered) drive name and information about the Exec device name and unit number. MakeDosNode() is called to create a DOS device node. MakeDosNode() constructs a filesystem startup message from the given information and fills in defaults for the ROM filing system. 4. If MakeDosNode() succeeds then the driver checks to see if the entry is using a standard ("DOS\0") filing system. If not then the routine for patching in non-standard filing systems is called (see " Alien File Systems " below). 5. Now that the DOS node has been set up and the correct filing system segment has been associated with it, the driver checks PBFB_BOOTABLE to see if this partition is marked as bootable. If the partition is not bootable, or this is not autoboot time (DiagArea == 0) then the driver simply calls AddDosNode() to enqueue the DOS device node. If the partition is bootable, then the driver constructs a boot node and enqueues it on eb_MountList using the boot priority from the environment vector. If this boot priority is -128 then the partition is not considered bootable. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
