13 Timer Device / System Time ]" border=0> The Amiga has a system time feature provided for the convenience of the developer. It is a monotonically increasing time base which should be the same as real time. The timer device provides two commands to use with the system time. In addition, there are utility functions in utility.library which are very useful with system time. See the " Utility Library " chapter of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries for more information. The command TR_SETSYSTIME sets the system's idea of what time it is. The system starts out at time "zero" so it is safe to set it forward to the "real" time. However, care should be taken when setting the time backwards. The command TR_GETSYSTIME is used to get the system time. The timer device does not interpret system time to any physical value. By convention, it tells how many seconds have passed since midnight, January 1, 1978. Your program must calculate the time from this value. The function GetSysTime() can also be used to get the system time. It returns the same value as TR_GETSYSTIME , but uses less overhead. Whenever someone asks what time it is using TR_GETSYSTIME , the return value of the system time is guaranteed to be unique and unrepeating so that it can be used by applications as a unique identifier. System time at boot time. ------------------------- The timer device sets system time to zero at boot time. AmigaDOS will then reset the system time to the value specified on the boot disk. If the AmigaDOS C:SetClock command is given, this also resets system time. Here is a program that can be used to determine the system time. The command is executed by the timer device and, on return, the caller can find the data in his request block. Get_Systime.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
