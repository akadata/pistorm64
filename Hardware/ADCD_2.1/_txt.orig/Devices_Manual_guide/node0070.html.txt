3 Clipboard Device / Monitoring Clipboard Changes ]" border=0> Some applications require notification of changes to data on the clipboard. Typically, these applications will need to do some processing when this occurs. You can set up such an environment through the CBD_CHANGEHOOK command. CBD_CHANGEHOOK allows you to specify a hook to be called when the data on the clipboard changes. For example, a show clipboard utility would need to know when the data on the clipboard is changed so that it can display the new data. The hook it would specify would read the new clipboard data and display it for the user. You specify a hook for the clipboard device by initializing a Hook structure and then passing an IOClipReq to the device with CBD_CHANGEHOOK set in io_Command, 1 set in io_Length, and the address of the Hook structure set in io_Data. ULONG HookEntry (); /* Declare the hook assembly function */ struct IOClipReq *ClipIO; /* Declare the IOClipReq */ struct Hook *ClipHook; /* Declare the Hook */ /* Prepare the hook */ ClipHook->h_Entry = HookEntry; /* C intrfce in asmbly rout. HookEntry*/ ClipHook->h_SubEntry = HookFunc;/* Call function when Hook activated */ ClipHook->h_Data = FindTask(NULL);/* Set pointer to current task */ ClipIO->io_Data = (char *) ClipHook;/* Point to hook struct */ ClipIO->io_Length = 1; /* Add hook to clipboard */ ClipIO->io_Command = CBD_CHANGEHOOK; DoIO(clipIO); The above code fragment assumes that an assembly language routine HookEntry() has been coded: ; entry interface for C code _HookEntry: move.l a1,-(sp) ; push message packet pointer move.l a2,-(sp) ; push object pointer move.l a0,-(sp) ; push hook pointer move.l h_SubEntry(a0),a0 ; fetch C entry point ... jsr (a0) ; ... and call it lea 12(sp),sp ; fix stack rts It also assumes that the function HookFunc() has been coded. One of the example programs at the end of this chapter has hook processing in it. See the include file utility/ hooks.h and The Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries for further information on hooks. You remove a hook by passing an IOClipReq to the device with the address of the Hook structure set in io_Data, 0 set in io_Length and CBD_CHANGEHOOK set in io_Command. ClipIO->io_Data = (char *) ClipHook; /* point to hook struct */ ClipIO->io_Length = 0; /* Remove hook from clipboard */ ClipIO->io_Command = CBD_CHANGEHOOK; (DoIO (clipIO)) You must remove the hook or it will continue indefinitely.
