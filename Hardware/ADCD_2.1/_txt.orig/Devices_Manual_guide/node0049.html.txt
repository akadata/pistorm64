10 Printer Device / Sending Printer Commands to a Printer ]" border=0> As mentioned before, it is possible to include printer commands (escape sequences) in the character stream and send them to the printer using the CMD_WRITE device I/O command. It is also possible to use the printer command names using the device I/O command PRD_PRTCOMMAND with the IOPrtCmdReq data structure. This gives you a mnemonic way of setting the printer to your program needs. You send printer commands to the device by passing an IOPrtCmdReq to the device with PRD_PRTCOMMAND set in io_Command, the printer command set in io_PrtCommand and up to four parameters set in Parm0 through Parm3. #include PrintIO->iopc.io_PrtCommand = aSLRM; /* Set left & right margins */ PrintIO->iopc.io_Parm0 = 1; /* Set left margin = 1 */ PrintIO->iopc.io_Parm1 = 79; /* Set right margin = 79 */ PrintIO->iopc.io_Parm2 = 0; PrintIO->iopc.io_Parm3 = 0; PrintIO->iopc.io_Command = PRD_PRTCOMMAND; DoIO((struct IORequest *)PrintIO); Consult the command function table listed below for other printer commands.
