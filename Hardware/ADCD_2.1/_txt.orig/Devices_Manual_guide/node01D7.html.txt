App.A EA IFF/ Primitive Data Types ]" border=0> Atomic components such as integers and characters that are interpretable directly by the CPU are specified in one format for all processors. We chose a format that's the same as used by the Motorola MC68000 processor [M68000 16/32-Bit Microprocessor Programmer's Reference Manual]. The high byte and high word of a number are stored first. N.B.: Part 3 dictates the format for "primitive" data types where-and only where-used in the overall file structure. The number of such occurrences of dictated formats will be small enough that the costs of conversion, storage, and management of processor-specific files would far exceed the costs of conversion during I/O by "foreign" programs. A particular data chunk may be specified with a different format for its internal primitive types or with processor or environment specific variants if necessary to optimize local usage. Since that hurts data interchange, it's not recommended. (Cf. Designing New Data Sections, in Part 4.)
