5 / Gameport Events / Determining The Trigger Conditions ]" border=0> You determine the conditions required for triggering gameport events by passing an I/O request to the device with GPD_ASKTRIGGER set in io_Command, the length of the GamePortTrigger structure set in io_Length and the address of the structure set in io_Data. The gameport device will respond with the event trigger conditions currently set. struct IOStdReq *GameIO; /* Must be initialized prior to using */ struct GamePortTrigger GameTR; void get_trigger_conditions(struct GamePortTrigger *GameTR) { GameIO->io_Command = GPD_ASKTRIGGER; /* get type of triggers */ GameIO->io_Data = (APTR)GameTR; /* place data here */ GameIO->io_Length= sizeof(GameTR); DoIO(GameIO); } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
