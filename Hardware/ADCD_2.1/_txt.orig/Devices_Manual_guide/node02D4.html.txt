Appendix A. Quick Reference / 8SVX Regular Expression ]" border=0> Here's a regular expression summary of the FORM 8SVX syntax. This could be an IFF file or part of one. 8SVX ::= "FORM" #{ "8SVX" VHDR [NAME] [Copyright] [AUTH] ANNO* [ATAK] [RLSE] BODY } VHDR ::= "VHDR" #{ Voice8Header } NAME ::= "NAME" #{ CHAR* } [0] Copyright::= "(c) " #{ CHAR* } [0] AUTH ::= "AUTH" #{ CHAR* } [0] ANNO ::= "ANNO" #{ CHAR* } [0] ATAK ::= "ATAK" #{ EGPoint* } RLSE ::= "RLSE" #{ EGPoint* } BODY ::= "FORM" #{ BYTE* } [0] The token "#" represents a ckSize LONG count of the following {braced} data bytes. E.g., a VHDR 's "#" should equal sizeof(Voice8Header). Literal items are shown in "quotes", [square bracket items] are optional, and "*" means 0 or more replications. A sometimes-needed pad byte is shown as "[0]". Actually, the order of chunks in a FORM 8SVX is not as strict as this regular expression indicates. The property chunks VHDR , NAME, Copyright, and AUTH may actually appear in any order as long as they all precede the BODY chunk. The optional data chunks ANNO, ATAK , and RLSE don't have to precede the BODY chunk. And of course, new kinds of chunks may appear inside a FORM 8SVX in the future. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
