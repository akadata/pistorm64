SMUS IFF Simple Musical Score / Background ]" border=0> Here's some background information on score representation in general and design choices for SMUS . First, we'll borrow some terminology from the Structured Sound Synthesis Project. [See the SSSP reference .] A "musical note" is one kind of scheduled event. Its properties include an event duration, an event delay, and a timbre object. The event duration tells the scheduler how long the note should last. The event delay tells how long after starting this note to wait before starting the next event. The timbre object selects sound driver data for the note; an "instrument" or "timbre". A "rest" is a sort of a null event. Its only property is an event delay. Classical Event Durations Tracks Instrument Registers MIDI Instruments [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
