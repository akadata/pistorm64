3 / Device Interface / Writing To The Clipboard Device ]" border=0> You write to the clipboard device by passing an IOClipReq to the device with CMD_WRITE set in io_Command, the number of bytes to be written set in io_Length and the address of the write buffer set in io_Data. ClipIO->io_Data = (char *) data; ClipIO->io_Length = 4L; ClipIO->io_Command = CMD_WRITE; An initial write should set io_Offset to zero. Each time a write is done, the device will increment io_Offset by the length of the write. As previously stated, the data you write to the clipboard must be in IFF format. This requires a certain amount of preparation prior to actually writing the data if it is not already in IFF format. A brief explanation of the IFF format will be helpful in this regard. For our purposes, we will limit our discussion to a simple formatted text (FTXT) IFF file. An FTXT file looks like: FORM FTXT CHRS Note: Uppercase characters above are literals. Based on the above file format, a hex dump of an IFF FTXT file containing the string "Enterprise" would look like: 0000 464F524D FORM 0004 00000016 (length of FTXT, CHRS, 0xA and data) 0008 46545854 FTXT 000C 43485253 CHRS 0010 0000000A (length of Enterprise) 0014 456E7465 Ente 0018 72707269 rpri 001C 7365 se A code fragment for doing this: LONG slen = strlen ("Enterprise"); BOOL odd = (slen & 1); /* pad byte flag */ /* set length depending on whether string is odd or even length */ LONG length = (odd) ? slen + 1 : slen; /* Reset the clip id */ ClipIO->io_ClipID = 0; ClipIO->io_Offset = 0; error = writeLong ((LONG *) "FORM");/* "FORM" */ /* add 12 bytes for FTXT,CHRS & length byte to string length */ length += 12; error = writeLong (&length); error = writeLong ((LONG *) "FTXT");/* "FTXT" for example */ error = writeLong ((LONG *) "CHRS");/* "CHRS" for example */ error = writeLong (&slen); /* # (length of string) */ ClipIO->io_Command = CMD_WRITE; ClipIO->io_Data = (char *) string; ClipIO->io_Length = slen; /* length of string */ error = (LONG) DoIO (clipIO); /* text string */ LONG writeLong (LONG * ldata) { ClipIO->io_Command = CMD_WRITE; ClipIO->io_Data = (char *) ldata; ClipIO->io_Length = 4L; return ( (LONG) DoIO (clipIO) ); } The fragment above does no error checking because it's a fragment. You should always error check. See the example programs at the end of this chapter for the proper method of error checking. Iffparse That Data! ------------------- Keep in mind that the functions in the iffparse.library can be used to write data to the clipboard. See the " IFFParse Library " chapter of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries for more information. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
