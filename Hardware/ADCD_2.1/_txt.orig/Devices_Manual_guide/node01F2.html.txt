Standard File Structure / Scrap Files (not currently used) ]" border=0> A "scrap file" is for maximum interconnectivity in getting data between programs; the core of a clipboard function. Scrap files may have type "IFF " or filename extension ".IFF". A scrap file is typically a CAT containing alternate representations of the same basic information. Include as many alternatives as you can readily generate. This redundancy improves interconnectivity in situations where we can't make all programs read and write super-general formats. [Inside Macintosh chapter "Scrap Manager".] E.g., a graphically-annotated musical score might be supplemented by a stripped down 4-voice melody and by a text (the lyrics). The originating program should write the alternate representations in order of "preference": most preferred (most comprehensive) type to least preferred (least comprehensive) type. A receiving program should either use the first appearing type that it understands or search for its own "preferred" type. A scrap file should have at most one alternative of any type. (A LIST of same type objects is OK as one of the alternatives.) But don't count on this when reading; ignore extra sections of a type. Then a program that reads scrap files can read something out of single purpose files. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
