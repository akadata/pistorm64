2 / ADCMD_ALLOCATE / ADCMD_ALLOCATE Examples ]" border=0> The following are more examples of how to tell ADCMD_ALLOCATE your channel preferences. If you want any channel, but want a right channel first, use an array containing 1, 8, 2, and 4: 0001 1000 0010 0100 If you only want a right channel, use 1 and 8 (channels 0 and 3): 0001 1000 If you want only a left channel, use 2 and 4 (channels 1 and 2): 0010 0100 If you want to allocate a channel and keep it for a sound that can be interrupted and restarted, allocate it at a certain precedence. If it is stolen, allocate it again with the ADIOF_NOWAIT flag set to 0. When the channel is relinquished, you will get it again. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
