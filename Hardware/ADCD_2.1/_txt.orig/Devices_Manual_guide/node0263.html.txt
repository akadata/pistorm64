DR2D.doc / KERN ]" border=0> KERN (0x4B45524C) /* Kerning pair */ The KERN chunk describes a kerning pair. A kerning pair sets the distance between a specific pair of characters. struct KERNstruct { short Ch1, Ch2; /* The pair to kern (allows for 16 bits...) */ IEEE XDisplace, /* Amount to displace -left +right */ YDisplace; /* Amount to displace -down +up */ }; The Ch1 and Ch2 fields contain the pair of characters to kern. These characters are typically stored as ASCII codes. Notice that OFNT stores the characters as a 16-bit value. Normally, characters are stored as 8-bit values. The wary programmer will be sure to cast assigns properly to avoid problems with assigning an 8-bit value to a 16-bit variable. The remaining fields, XDisplace and YDisplace, supply the baseline shift from Ch1 to Ch2. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
