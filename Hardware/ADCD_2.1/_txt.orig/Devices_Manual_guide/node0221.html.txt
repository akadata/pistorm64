AIFF / The Marker Chunk / Marker Chunk Format ]" border=0> The format for the data within a Marker Chunk is shown below. #define MarkerID 'MARK' /* ckID for Marker Chunk */ typedef struct { ID ckID; long ckSize; unsigned short numMarkers; Marker Markers []; } MarkerChunk; The ckID is always 'MARK'. The ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk in bytes. It does not include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize. The numMarkers field is the number of markers in the Marker Chunk. If numMarkers is non-zero, it is followed by the markers themselves. Because all fields in a marker are an even number of bytes, the length of any marker will always be even. Thus, markers are packed together with no unused bytes between them. The markers need not be ordered in any particular manner. The Marker Chunk is optional. No more than one Marker Chunk can appear in a FORM AIFF. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
