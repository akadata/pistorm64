AIFF / The Marker Chunk / Markers ]" border=0> A marker has the following format. typedef short MarkerId; typedef struct { MarkerID id; unsigned long position; pstring markerName; } Marker; The id is a number that uniquely identifies that marker within a FORM AIFF. The id can be any positive non-zero integer, as long as no other marker within the same FORM AIFF has the same id. The marker's position in the sound data is determined by the position field. Markers conceptually fall between two sample frames. A marker that falls before the first sample frame in the sound data is at position zero, while a marker that falls between the first and second sample frame in the sound data is at position 1. Note that the units for position are sample frames, not bytes nor sample points.

Note: Some "EA IFF 85" files store strings a C-strings (text bytes followed by a null terminating character) instead of Pascal-style strings. Audio IFF uses pstrings because they are more efficiently skipped over when scanning through chunks. Using pstrings, a program can skip over a string by adding the string count to the address of the first character. C strings require that each character in the string be examined for the null terminator. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
