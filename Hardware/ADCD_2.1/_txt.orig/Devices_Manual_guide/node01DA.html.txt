Primitive Data Types / Characters ]" border=0> The following character set is assumed wherever characters are used, e.g., in text strings, IDs, and TEXT chunks (see below). Characters are encoded in 8-bit ASCII. Characters in the range NUL (hex 0) through DEL (hex 7F) are well defined by the 7-bit ASCII standard. IFF uses the graphic group " " (SP, hex 20) through "~" (hex 7E). Most of the control character group hex 01 through hex 1F have no standard meaning in IFF. The control character LF (hex 0A) is defined as a "newline" character. It denotes an intentional line break, that is, a paragraph or line terminator. (There is no way to store an automatic line break. That is strictly a function of the margins in the environment the text is placed.) The controlcharacter ESC (hex 1B) is a reserved escape character under the rules of ANSI standard 3.64-1979 American National Standard Additional Control Codes for Use with ASCII, ISO standard 2022, and ISO/DIS standard 6429.2. Characters in the range hex 7F through hex FF are not globally defined in IFF. They are best left reserved for future standardization. (Note that the FORM type FTXT (formatted text) defines the meaning of these characters within FTXT forms.) In particular, character values hex 7F through hex 9F are control codes while characters hex A0 through hex FF are extended graphic characters like Å, as per the ISO and ANSI standards cited above.
