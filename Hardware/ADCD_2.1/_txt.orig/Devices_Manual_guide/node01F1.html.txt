Standard File Structure / Single Purpose Files ]" border=0> A single purpose IFF file is for normal "document" and "archive" storage. This is in contrast with "scrap files" (see below) and temporary backing storage (non-interchange files). The external file type (or filename extension, depending on the host file system) indicates the file's contents. It's generally the FORM type of the data contained, hence the restrictions on FORM type IDs. Programmers and users may pick an "intended use" type as the filename extension to make it easy to filter for the relevant files in a filename requester. This is actually a "subclass" or "subtype" that conveniently separates files of the same FORM type that have different uses. Programs cannot demand conformity to its expected subtypes without overly restricting data interchange since they cannot know about the subtypes to be used by future programs that users will want to exchange data with. Issue: How to generate 3-letter MS-DOS extensions from 4-letter FORM type IDs? Most single purpose files will be a single FORM (perhaps a composite FORM like a musical score containing nested FORMs like musical instrument descriptions). If it's a LIST or a CAT , programs should skip over unrecognized objects to read the recognized ones or the first recognized one. Then a program that can read a single purpose file can read something out of a "scrap file", too. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
