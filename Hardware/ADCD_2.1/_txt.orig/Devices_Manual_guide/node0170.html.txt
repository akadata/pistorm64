Standard Data and Property Chunks / Positioning Units ]" border=0> Unless otherwise specified, position and size units used in FTXT formatting properties and control sequences are in decipoints (720 decipoints/inch). This is ANSI/ISO Positioning Unit Mode (PUM) 2. While a metric standard might be nice, decipoints allow the existing U.S.A. typographic units to be encoded easily, e.g., "12 points" is "120 decipoints". [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
