Standard Data and Property Chunks / Data Chunk TRAK ]" border=0> The main contents of a score is stored in one or more TRAK chunks representing parallel "tracks". One TRAK chunk per track. The contents of a TRAK chunk is an array of 16-bit "events" such as "note", "rest", and "set instrument". Events are really commands to a simple scheduler, stored in time order. The tracks can be polyphonic, that is, they can contain chorded "note" events. Each event is stored as an "SEvent" record. ("SEvent" means "simple musical event".) Each SEvent has an 8-bit type field called an "sID" and 8 bits of type-dependent data. This is like a machine language instruction with an 8-bit opcode and an 8-bit operand. This format is extensible since new event types can be defined in the future. The "note" and "rest" events are the only ones that every program must understand. We will carefully design any new event types so that programs can safely skip over unrecognized events in a score. Caution: ID codes must be allocated by a central clearinghouse to avoid conflicts. Commodore Applications and Technical Support provides this clearinghouse service. Here are the C type definitions for TRAK and "SEvent" and the currently defined sID values. Afterward are details on each SEvent. #define ID_TRAK MakeID('T', 'R', 'A', 'K') /* TRAK chunk contains an SEvent[]. */ /* SEvent: Simple musical event. */ typedef struct { UBYTE sID; /* SEvent type code */ UBYTE data; /* sID-dependent data */ } SEvent; /* SEvent type codes "sID". */ #define SID_FirstNote 0 #define SID_LastNote 127 /* sIDs in the range SID_FirstNote through * SID_LastNote (sign bit = 0) are notes. * The sID is the MIDI tone number (pitch).*/ #define SID_Rest 128 /* a rest (same data format as a note). */ #define SID_Instrument 129 /* set instrument number for this track. */ #define SID_TimeSig 130 /* set time signature for this track. */ #define SID_KeySig 131 /* set key signature for this track. */ #define SID_Dynamic 132 /* set volume for this track. */ #define SID_MIDI_Chnl 133 /* set MIDI channel number (sequencers) */ #define SID_MIDI_Preset 134 /* set MIDI preset number (sequencers) */ #define SID_Clef 135 /* inline clef change. * 0=Treble, 1=Bass, 2=Alto, 3=Tenor.(new) */ #define SID_Tempo 136 /* Inline tempo in beats per minute.(new) */ /* SID values 144 through 159: reserved for Instant Music SEvents. */ /* Remaining sID values up through 254: reserved for future * standardization. */ #define SID_Mark 255 /* sID reserved for an end-mark in RAM. */ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
