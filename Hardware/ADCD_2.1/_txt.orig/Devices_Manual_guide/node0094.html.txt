4 Console Device / Selecting Raw Input Events ]" border=0> If the keyboard information - including "cooked" keystrokes - does not give you enough information about input events, you can request additional information from the console driver. The command to SET RAW EVENTS is formatted as: [event-types-separated-by-semicolons]{ If, for example, you need to know when each key is pressed and released, you would request "RAW keyboard input." This is done by writing " 1{" to the console. In a single SET RAW EVENTS request, you can ask the console to set up for multiple event types at one time. You must send multiple numeric parameters, separating them by semicolons (;). For example, to ask for gadget pressed, gadget released, and close gadget events, write: 7;8;11{ You can reset, that is, delete from reporting, one or more of the raw input event types by using the RESET RAW EVENTS command, in the same manner as the SET RAW EVENTS was used to establish them in the first place. This command stream is formatted as: [event-types-separated-by-semicolons]} So, for example, you could reset all of the events set in the above example by transmitting the command sequence: 7;8;11} The Read Stream May Not Be Dry. ------------------------------- There could still be pending RAW INPUT EVENTS in your read stream after turning off one or more RAW INPUT EVENTS. The following table lists the valid raw input event types. RAW INPUT EVENT TYPES Request Request Number Description Number Description ------- ----------- ------ ----------- 0 No-op (used internally) 11 Close Gadget 1 RAW keyboard input * 12 Window resized 2 RAW mouse input 13 Window refreshed 3 Private Console Event 14 Preferences changed 4 Pointer position 15 Disk removed 5 (unused) 16 Disk inserted 6 Timer 17 Active window 7 Gadget pressed 18 Inactive window 8 Gadget released 19 New pointer position (V36) 9 Requester activity 20 Menu help (V36) 10 Menu numbers 21 Window changed (V36) (zoom, move) * Note:Intuition swallows all except the select button. The event types-requester, window refreshed, active window, inactive window, window resized and window changed-are dispatched to the console unit which owns the window from which the events are generated, even if it is not the active (selected ) window at the time the event is generated. This ensures that the proper console unit is notified of those events. All other events are dispatched to the active console unit (if it has requested those events). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
