10 / Writing A Graphics Printer Driver / Printertag.asm ]" border=0> For a graphic printer the printer-specific values that need to be filled in in printertag.asm are as follows: MaxXDots The maximum number of dots the printer can print across the page. MaxYDots The maximum number of dots the printer can print down the page. Generally, if the printer supports roll or form feed paper, this value should be 0 indicating that there is no limit. If the printer has a definite y dots maximum (as a laser printer does), this number should be entered here. XDotsInch The dot density in x (supplied by SetDensity() , if it exists). YDotsInch The dot density in y (supplied by SetDensity() , if it exists). PrinterClass The printer class of the printer. PPC_BWALPHA black&white alphanumeric, no graphics. PPC_BWGFX black&white (only) graphics. PPC_COLORALPHA color alphanumeric, no graphics. PPC_COLORGFX color (and maybe black&white) graphics. ColorClass The color class the printer falls into. PCC_BW Black&White only PCC_YMC Yellow Magenta Cyan only. PCC_YMC_BW Yellow Magenta Cyan or Black&White, but not both PCC_YMCB Yellow Magenta Cyan Black PCC_WB White&Black only, 0 is BLACK PCC_BGR Blue Green Red PCC_BGR_WB Blue Green Red or Black&White PCC_BGRW Blue Green Red White NumRows The number of pixel rows printed by one pass of the print head. This number is used by the non-printer-specific code to determine when to make a render Case 2 call to you. You have to keep this number in mind when determining how big a buffer you'll need to store one print cycle's worth of data. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
