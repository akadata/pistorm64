Unresolved Issues ]" border=0> Unfortunately, it isn't possible to completely isolate network protocols from the hardware they run on. Hardware types and addressing both remain somewhat hardware-dependent in spite of our efforts. See the " Packet Type " section for an explanation of how packet types are handled and why protocols cannot be isolated from them. See the " Addressing " section for an explanation of how addressing is handled any why protocols cannot be isolated from it. Additionally, there are at least two cases where a hardware type has multiple framing methods in use (ethernet/802.3 and arcnet/(Novell) "ARCNET Packet Header Definition Standard"). In both cases, software which must interoperate with other platforms on this hardware may need to be aware of the distinctions and may have to do extra processing in order to use the appropriate frame type. See the sections on " Ethernet Packet Types " and on " ARCNET frames " for more details. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
