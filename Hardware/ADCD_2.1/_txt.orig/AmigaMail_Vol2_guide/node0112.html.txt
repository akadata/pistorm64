Listening for Network and Amiga Events ]" border=0> Once back in the main() routine, the application is almost ready to start processing network events. The only thing remaining is to decide what kind of events the server needs to hear about. Most applications will need to be aware of both network and local Amiga events, which means separate masks need to be set up for both types of events. On the network side, the mask needs to contain information on which sockets need responses. /* First, prepare the various masks for signal processing */ fd_set sockmask; FD_ZERO( &sockmask ); FD_SET( socket, &sockmask ); The sockmask variable will be used as a template to indicate what network events the application notices. Since sockmask came off the stack and contains garbage, the FD_ZERO() call clears all its network signal bits. The FD_SET() call sets the mask to listen for events relating to the socket that the server created earlier. Everything is prepared, so the next step is entering the event loop itself. long umask; fd_set mask; while(1) { /* ** Reset the mask values for another pass */ mask = sockmask; umask = SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C; /* ** selectwait is a combo network and Amiga Wait() rolled into ** a single call. It allows the app to respond to both Amiga ** signals (CTRL-C in this case) and to network events. ** ** Here, if the selectwait event is the SIGBREAK signal, we ** bail and AppPanic() but otherwise its a network event. */ if (selectwait( 2, &mask, NULL, NULL, NULL, &umask ) == -1 ) { AppPanic("CTRL-C:\nProgram terminating!",0); } Before an event occurs, the mask variable tells selectwait() which network events the server wants to receive. After an event occurs, the mask variable indicates which socket triggered the network event. The sockmask variable is used to reset mask back to its original mask value at the top of each pass through the event loop. In addition to waiting on network events, selectwait() also waits on Exec signals for the current task. For this example, the only Amiga event the server cares about is a Ctrl-C break (SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C). The selectwait() function has a simple purpose, but due to the wide scope of network events, the function has a myriad of parameters and configurations. This example uses the bare minimum of what's possible using selectwait(), and many network-friendly applications will be able to get by using only a small subset of selectwait()'s potential. In this case, the network event set is passed in mask, and the Amiga event mask is passed in umask. If selectwait() returns with a value of -1, it means the Amiga event mask was the trigger. Otherwise, a network event caused the function to return. This example is simple enough that a Ctrl-C interrupt can be handled rather easily. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
