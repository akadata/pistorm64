The Save Requester ]" border=0> The Save requester is a special type of file requester. The release 2.0 save requester differs from the regular file requester in several ways. The first is its appearance. The color of the text making up the file name list and the color of the backround the text is rendered on are swapped for the save requester. This makes the difference between the save and file requesters visual as well as functional. Another difference, is that a save requester does not allow the user to select by double-clicking on a file name. This prevents the user from accidentally double-clicking, and thus over-writing, the wrong file. The other difference is that if the user types a directory name into the save requester and the directory doesn't exist, the save requester will create that directory (after getting the user's permission via another requester). The FILF_SAVE flag from the ASL_FuncFlags tag creates a save requester. Note that it does not make sense to have multiple selection in a save requester, so the FILF_SAVE flag overrides the FILF_MULTISELECT flag. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
