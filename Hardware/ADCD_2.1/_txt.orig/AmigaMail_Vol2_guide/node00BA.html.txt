Zooming ]" border=0> A very simple, but convenient feature you can ask the system to add to your window is a zoom gadget. A zoom gadget allows the user to toggle between two window sizes simply by clicking on a gadget. In 2.0, a window gets a zoom gadget automatically when it has both a sizing and depth gadget, although you don't need a sizing gadget to get a zoom gadget. You can ask for a zoom gadget by specifying the WA_Zoom tag when opening the window. The WA_Zoom tag takes an array of four WORDs, describing the initial LeftEdge, TopEdge, Width, and Height values of the window's alternate dimensions and position. Because such a window has no sizing gadget, the user can only toggle between two window sizes, the original size and the alternate size specified with the WA_Zoom tag. The preference editors use this feature to toggle between a full-sized window and a window displaying only the title bar. The example zoom.c shows how easy it is to implement this feature.
