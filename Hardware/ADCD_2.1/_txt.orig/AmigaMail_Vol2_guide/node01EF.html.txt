sana2.device/S2_CONFIGINTERFACE ]" border=0> NAME ConfigInterface -- Configure the network interface. FUNCTION This command causes the device driver to initialize the interface hardware and to set the network interface address to the address in ios2_SrcAddr. This command can only be executed once and, if successful, will leave the driver and network interface fully operational and the network interface in ios2_SrcAddr. To set the interface address to the factory address, the network management software must use GetStationAddress first and then call ConfigInterface with the result. If there is no factory address then the network software must pick an address to use. Until this command is executed the device will not listen for any packets on the hardware. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - S2_CONFIGINTERFACE. ios2_Flags - Supported flags are: SANA2IOB_QUICK ios2_SrcAddr - Address for this interface. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. ios2_SrcAddr - Address of this interface as configured. NOTES Some networks have the interfaces choose a currently unused interface address each time the interface is initialized. The caller must check ios2_SrcAddr for the actual interface address after configuring the interface. SEE ALSO S2_GETSTATIONADDRESS BUGS [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
