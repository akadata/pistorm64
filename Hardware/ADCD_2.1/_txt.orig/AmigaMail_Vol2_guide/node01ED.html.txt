sana2.device/S2_ADDMULTICASTADDRESS ]" border=0> NAME AddMulticastAddress -- Enable an interface multicast address. FUNCTION This command causes the device driver to enable multicast packet reception for the requested address. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - S2_ADDMULTICASTADDRESS. ios2_SrcAddr - Multicast address to enable. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. NOTES Multicast addresses are added globally -- anyone using the device may receive packets as a result of any multicast address which has been added for the device. Since multicast addresses are not "bound" to a particular packet type, each enabled multicast address has an "enabled" count associated with it so that if two protocols add the same multicast address and later one removes it, it is still enabled until the second removes it.
