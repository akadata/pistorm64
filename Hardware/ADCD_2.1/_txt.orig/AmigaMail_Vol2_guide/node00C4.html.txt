Backfill Hook ]" border=0> Whenever a layer sustains damage, the damaged region is cleared to color 0. Clearing the region requires an often lengthy Blitter operation which is unnecessary if the application plans to redraw the damaged region anyway. Such an application can improve its performance by preventing the Layers library from clearing the damaged regions. This is what layer backfill hooks are for. Backfill hooks are a new Layers library feature added in Release 2. A backfill hook is a custom function that an application attaches to a specific layer. Whenever damage occurs to a layer, the Layers library calls that layer's custom backfill hook. The Layers library passes the position and dimensions of the damage area to the backfill hook. The backfill hook can render into the damage area, refreshing it. Theoretically, the backfill hook can redraw a layer's damaged regions instead of clearing the damage area to color 0. Unfortunately, refreshing a layer from a backfill hook can be quite difficult. The backfill hook code is usually called from a different task than the main application. If the backfill hook and the application do not properly arbitrate access to the application's data, dangerous race conditions can occur if the hook and the application try to access the same data. Another problem with rendering through the backfill hook is that no clipping is available. The backfill hook must do its own clipping to ensure that no rendering goes outside the dimensions specified when the hook is called, which in itself can be quite difficult. For many situations, the best use of a backfill hook is to have it do nothing. Whenever the hook is called, it simply returns without doing any rendering. This has the effect of eliminating the extra blit done to clear the damage region to color 0. This can speed layer operations quite a bit. There is one problem with a no-op backfill hook. If the application is busy doing some processing and damage occurs to its layer, the display will remain dirty until the application finishes its processing and notices that the layer is damaged. This damage can include remnants of system imagery, like window borders, which can confuse the user. One way to overcome this problem is to use a backfill hook that changes its behavior depending on the state of the application. If the application is not too busy to notice damage to its window's layer, the backfill hook does not erase the display. However, if the application is too busy to refresh its damaged window, the backfill hook clears the damaged portion of the display. Using this method, the backfill hook will not waste time erasing the damage when the application will update it immediately, but the backfill hook will erase the damage if the application can't refresh for a while.
