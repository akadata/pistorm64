VIII-1: Using the Amiga A3000UX as a NFS File Server ]" border=0> By David Miller - Unix Technical Support Specialist, CATS You've just added an A3000UX to your ethernet and you can rcp and ftp files between UNIX and AmigaDOS using the AS225 TCP/IP software. Great! But what about the AS225's Network File System (NFS) client software? Under AmigaDOS, the NFS software lets your Amiga mount the drives of a NFS server as normal DOS volumes, but how do you set up a server? NFS allows one machine to share files with other machines connected to a network. NFS lets multiple machines access the same files, so only one copy of the data is necessary. A client machine (a client is any machine that can mount a shared directory) can free some of its disk space by moving common programs to the server's disk (a server is any machine that shares a part of its disk with other machines). There are however limitations when sharing files between machines with different operating systems. For example; * Filenames - UNIX S5 filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14 characters. If you copy files from AmigaDOS to UNIX, make sure that they are unique in the first 14 characters. And don't forget about the ".info" files! If you copy a file that has a ".info" file associated with it, be sure that the name preceding the ".info" does not exceed 9 characters. * Permissions - UNIX files have permissions for read, write, and execute. There is no delete permission; if you have write access to the directory, you can delete any file it contains. Script and archive bits are not supported either, so setting the script or archive bits, or clearing the delete bit will not work. * Filenotes - UNIX does not support filenotes. If you copy a file from an AmigaDOS filesystem to a UNIX filesystem, any file notes will be lost. Likewise, you cannot add a comment to a file on a UNIX filesystem. You will not receive any error indication, but the operation will have no effect. The following notes will walk you step-by-step through the process of configuring and administering NFS on the A3000UX. If you have used NFS before with BSD, Sun/OS, Ultrix, or any other operating system, you should at least skim over these notes, because the implementation is different under UNIX SVR4. To keep this article brief, I'm making the following assumptions: * You know how to use one of the editors shipped with Amiga UNIX. * You know how to log in as root or how to su to root. If you don't, read the Learning Amiga UNIX and Using Amiga UNIX manuals which come with the A3000UX. The five examples illustrate how to do some simple file sharing with NFS. Using the concepts discussed in these examples you will be able to select the options necessary to share files while maintaining system security and integrity. But, first, you need to start the networking software on the A3000UX, if it's not already running. To do this, type the following: # init 3 This changes the operating to ``run-level'' 3, the networking run-level. Other run-levels include: S - single user maintenance mode 0 - system power off 1 - single user mode 2 - multiuser mode w/o networking 3 - multiuser mode w/ networking 4 - user defined 5 - system reboot 6 - system reboot To find out what your machine's current run-level is, type: # who -r The output will look something like this: run-level 3 Jun 18 18:40 3 0 S Here's what all of that means: run-level 3 Jun 18 18:40 3 0 S ----------- ------------ - - - | | | | | This is the ____| | | | | current state | | | | of your machine | | | | | | | | This is when the current ______| | | | run-level was entered | | | | | | This is the current run-level ____________| | | | | This is the number of times | | your machine has been in this _________________| | run-level before. | | This is the previous run-level _____________________| This is the host table (/etc/inet/hosts on Amiga UNIX and INET:db/hosts on AmigaDOS) that I'll be using for the examples: # # TCP/IP HOST TABLE # # 127.0.0.1 localhost loghost loopback me # # # Widget works engineering network # # # IP Number Name Nickname Comment # 192.9.120.1 Hydrogen H # A3000UX - in comp center 192.9.120.2 Helium He # A2000 - in room 316 192.9.120.3 Lithium Li # A2500 - in room 321 192.9.120.4 Beryllium Be # A3000 - in room 320 192.9.120.5 Boron B # A2500 - in room 119 192.9.120.6 Carbon C # A2000 - in room 119 192.9.120.7 Nitrogen N # A2000 - in room 204 192.9.120.8 Oxygen O # A3000 - in room 220 192.9.120.9 Fluorine F # A2500 - in room 132 192.9.120.10 Neon Ne # A3000 - in room 307 The host table contains a list of IP addresses with node names for each of those addresses. The machine uses this list to find other nodes by their name, rather than their numeric IP address. Example 1 --------- Hydrogen has a directory called /home/scratch which is for temporary storage. Everyone should be able to read and write in this directory. To share this with the rest of the net, the administrator of Hydrogen would type: share -F nfs -o rw /home/scratch where: share is the command to share files between hosts. -F nfs tells the program share to use the NFS filesystem. -o rw tells the program share to allow all systems both read and write access to the shared files. This is the default if you don't supply any options. I've just included it here for completeness. /home/scratch is the directory to be shared. Example 2 --------- Hydrogen also has a large disk attached as /storage. To allow other hosts to use this as extra disk space type the following: share -F nfs -o rw=Helium /storage/Helium share -F nfs -o rw=Lithium /storage/Lithium ... share -F nfs -o rw=Ne /storage/Neon where: -o rw=name tells share to allow to mount this resource and to deny access to everyone else. This establishes private storage areas for each host. This way all of the hosts can share the disk without having their files readable by everyone on the network. Note the use of the nickname Ne for the host Neon. Nicknames must be explicitly entered in the host table and may be used interchangeably with the full name of the host. Example 3 --------- A group of hosts on the first floor of your building are all being used on one big project, so they need a common work area to store files. The administrator could create a work area in /storage called, for example, ff-project, for first-floor-project, then give the hosts on the first floor access to this work area by typing: share -F nfs -o rw=Boron:Carbon:Fluorine /storage/ff-project where: -o rw=name[:name]... allows read and write access to the hosts that are listed and denies access to everyone else and /storage/ff-project is the name of the directory to share. Example 4 --------- Hydrogen has a directory called /home/public which is full of useful Amiga tools. To share these with the rest of the net, the administrator of Hydrogen would type: share -F nfs -o ro /home/public where: -o ro tells share to make the shared filesystem readable to all hosts and writable by no one. The ``ro'' stands for ``read-only'' and /home/public is the name of the directory to share. The files are shared read-only for two reasons. The first is that it prevents temporary files from being created in the shared partition. Also it prevents accidental or malicious removal of shared files. Example 5 --------- Now, coincidentally, Hydrogen also has a directory called /home/private which is full of special tools used only by the development staff on the 3rd floor. To share these exclusively with the hosts on the third floor, the administrator of Hydrogen would type: share -F nfs -o ro=He:Li:Be:Ne /home/private where: -o ro=name[:name]... tells the share program to give the listed hosts read access to the shared files. All other hosts will be denied access to the shared files (Note the use of nicknames) and /home/private is the name of the shared filesystem. These options may be combined to allow different types of access. For example: -o rw=Helium:Neon,ro Everyone can read shared files, but only Helium and Neon have write access. -o rw,ro=Fluorine Everyone except Fluorine may read and write files. Fluorine may only read files. -o rw=C:O,ro=N Carbon and Oxygen have read and write access, Nitrogen has read access, and the others have no access. To summarize: -o ro Gives everyone read-only access to the shared files -o rw Gives everyone read/write access -o ro=... Gives read-only access to the listed hosts -o rw=... Gives read/write access to the listed hosts If a host appears in both a rw= and a ro= list, the host will be given read and write access. The ordering of the options does not matter. Since you probably want these directories to be shared automatically every time you start Amiga UNIX, you need to perform the following steps: 1. Edit the file /etc/inittab and change the line: is:2:initdefault to is:3:initdefault This will make your machine go directly to run-level 3 when you boot the UNIX Operating System. 2. Edit the file /etc/dfs/dfstab, and enter one line for each directory to be shared. For Example 1 above, this would be the line: share -F nfs -o ro /home/public So, the complete dfstab for the 5 examples given above would look something like this: # # For Example 1 # share -F nfs -o rw /home/scratch # # For Example 2 # share -F nfs -o rw=Hydrogen /storage/Hydrogen share -F nfs -o rw=Helium /storage/Helium share -F nfs -o rw=Lithium /storage/Lithium share -F nfs -o rw=Beryllium /storage/Beryllium share -F nfs -o rw=Boron /storage/Boron share -F nfs -o rw=Carbon /storage/Carbon share -F nfs -o rw=Nitrogen /storage/Nitrogen share -F nfs -o rw=Oxygen /storage/Oxygen share -F nfs -o rw=Fluorine /storage/Fluorine share -F nfs -o rw=Neon /storage/Neon # # For Example 3 # share -F nfs -o rw=Boron:Carbon:Fluorine /storage/ff-project # # For Example 4 # share -F nfs -o ro /home/public # # For Example 5 # share -F nfs -o ro=He:Li:Be:Ne /home/private 3. Run the command: shareall -F nfs which will share all of the NFS filesystems, and the command: unshareall -F nfs which will make the NFS filesystems unavailable.
