IM_HITFRAME ]" border=0> The IM_HITFRAME method is used to determine if a point is within an image that is contained within (or scaled to) the given rectangle. This method is intended to test images that were rendered using IM_DRAWFRAME. This method receives the following parameters: struct impHitTest { ULONG MethodID; struct { WORD X; WORD Y; } imp_Point; struct { WORD Width; WORD Height; } imp_Dimensions; }; The mytextlabelclass example blindly passes this method on to its superclass. The superclass treat this meothd just like the IM_HITTEST method. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
