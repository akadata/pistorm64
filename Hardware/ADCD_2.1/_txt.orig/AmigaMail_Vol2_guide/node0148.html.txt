Emulating the Remote Controller ]" border=0> One of the major differences between the A570 and the CDTV is the remote controller. The Amiga's keyboard, the mouse, and, optionally, the joystick replace the remote controller. Your title must take these differences into account, and your input handling routines may require modification. The following section will discuss these differences, and make additions to the CDTV User Interface Guidelines. Here is a chart describing how Amiga keyboard and mouse actions should correspond to the CDTV player's remote controller buttons.
