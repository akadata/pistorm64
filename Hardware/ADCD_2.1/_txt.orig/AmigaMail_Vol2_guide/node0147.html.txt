Memory ]" border=0> An Amiga with an A570 may have various amounts of RAM. In a CDTV the minimum memory configuration is 1 Mbyte of Chip RAM. Do not assume that all systems have the same memory configuration. Some users might try to run your application on an Amiga + A570 with only 512K of Chip RAM and no Fast RAM. Others may have a 512K Chip/512K Fast RAM system. To avoid crashing due to memory shortages, check the amount of memory available when your application begins execution. If not enough memory is available, you should display a message to that effect and stop operating rather than crashing the machine. Others may have more than 1 Mbyte of RAM: either Fast or Chip memory. Your title should also work properly under these conditions. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
