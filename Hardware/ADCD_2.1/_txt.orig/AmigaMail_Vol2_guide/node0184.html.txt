SYNOPSIS success = CloseAsync(file); LONG CloseAsync(struct AsyncFile *); FUNCTION Closes a file, flushing any pending writes. Once this call has been made, the file can no longer be accessed. INPUTS file - the file to close. May be NULL, in which case this function returns -1 and sets the IoErr() code to ERROR_INVALID_LOCk. RESULT result - = 0 for success. Indicates whether closing the file worked or not. If the file was opened in read-mode, then this call will always work. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), dos.library/Close() asyncio/OpenAsync asyncio/OpenAsync NAME OpenAsync -- open a file for asynchronous IO. SYNOPSIS file = OpenAsync(fileName, accessMode, bufferSize); struct AsyncFile OpenAsync(const STRPTR, UBYTE, LONG); FUNCTION The named file is opened and an async file handle returned. If the accessMode is MODE_READ, an existing file is opened for reading. If accessMode is MODE_WRITE, a new file is created for writing. If a file of the same name already exists, it is first deleted. If accessMode is MODE_APPEND, an existing file is prepared for writing. Data written is added to the end of the file. If the file does not exists, it is created. 'fileName' is a filename and CANNOT be a window specification such as CON: or RAW:, or "*" 'bufferSize' specifies the size of the IO buffer to use. There are in fact two buffers allocated, each of roughly (bufferSize/2) bytes in size. The actual buffer size use can vary slightly as the size is rounded to speed up DMA. If the file cannot be opened for any reason, the value returned will be NULL, and a secondary error code will be available by calling the routine dos.library/IoErr(). INPUTS name - name of the file to open, cannot be a window specification accessMode - one of MODE_READ, MODE_WRITE, or MODE_APPEND bufferSize - size of IO buffer to use. 8192 is recommended as it provides very good performance for relatively little memory. RESULTS file - an async file handle or NULL for failure. You should not access the fields in the AsyncFile structure, these are private to the async IO routines. In case of failure, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO CloseAsync(), dos.library/Open() asyncio/ReadAsync asyncio/ReadAsync NAME ReadAsync -- read bytes from an async file. SYNOPSIS actualLength = ReadAsync(file, buffer, numBytes); LONG ReadAsync(struct AsyncFile *, APTR, LONG); FUNCTION This function reads bytes of information from an opened async file into the buffer given. 'numBytes' is the number of bytes to read from the file. The value returned is the length of the information actually read. So, when 'actualLength' is greater than zero, the value of 'actualLength' is the the number of characters read. Usually ReadAsync() will try to fill up your buffer before returning. A value of zero means that end-of-file has been reached. Errors are indicated by a value of -1. INPUTS file - opened file to read, as obtained from OpenAsync() buffer - buffer where to put bytes read numBytes - number of bytes to read into buffer RESULT actualLength - actual number of bytes read, or -1 if an error. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), ReadCharAsync(), WriteAsync(), dos.library/Read() asyncio/ReadCharAsync asyncio/ReadCharAsync NAME ReadCharAsync -- read a single byte from an async file. SYNOPSIS byte = ReadCharAsync(file); LONG ReadCharAsync(struct AsyncFile *); FUNCTION This function reads a single byte from an async file. The byte is returned, or -1 if there was an error reading, or if the end-of-file was reached. INPUTS file - opened file to read from, as obtained from OpenAsync() RESULT byte - the byte read, or -1 if no byte was read. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. If IoErr() returns 0, it means end-of-file was reached. Any other value indicates an error. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), ReadAsync(), WriteCharAsync() dos.library/Read() asyncio/SeekAsync asyncio/SeekAsync NAME SeekAsync -- set the current position for reading or writing within an async file. SYNOPSIS oldPosition = SeekAsync(file, position, mode); LONG SeekAsync(struct AsyncFile *, LONG, BYTE); FUNCTION SeekAsync() sets the read/write cursor for the file 'file' to the position 'position'. This position is used by the various read/write functions as the place to start reading or writing. The result is the current absolute position in the file, or -1 if an error occurs, in which case dos.library/IoErr() can be used to find more information. 'mode' can be SEEK_START, SEEK_CURRENT or SEEK_END. It is used to specify the relative start position. For example, 20 from current is a position 20 bytes forward from current, -20 is 20 bytes back from current. To find out what the current position within a file is, simply seek zero from current. INPUTS file - an opened async file, as obtained from OpenAsync() position - the place where to move the read/write cursor mode - the mode for the position, one of SEEK_START, SEEK_CURRENT, or SEEK_END. RESULT oldPosition - the previous position of the read/write cursor, or -1 if an error occurs. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), ReadAsync(), WriteAsync(), dos.library/Seek() asyncio/WriteAsync asyncio/WriteAsync NAME WriteAsync -- write data to an async file. SYNOPSIS actualLength = WriteAsync(file, buffer, numBytes); LONG WriteAsync(struct AsyncFile *, APTR, LONG); FUNCTION WriteAsync() writes bytes of data to an opened async file. 'numBytes' indicates the number of bytes of data to be transferred. 'buffer' points to the data to write. The value returned is the length of information actually written. So, when 'numBytes' is greater than zero, the value of 'numBytes' is the number of characters written. Errors are indicated by a return value of -1. INPUTS file - an opened file, as obtained from OpenAsync() buffer - address of data to write numBytes - number of bytes to write to the file RESULT actualLength - number of bytes written, or -1 if error. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), ReadAsync(), WriteCharAsync(), dos.library/Write() asyncio/WriteCharAsync asyncio/WriteCharAsync NAME WriteCharAsync -- write a single byte to an async file. SYNOPSIS result = WriteCharAsync(file, byte); LONG WriteCharAsync(struct AsyncFile *, UBYTE); FUNCTION This function writes a single byte to an async file. INPUTS file - an opened async file, as obtained from OpenAsync() byte - byte of data to add to the file RESULT result - 1 if the byte was written, -1 if there was an error. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), ReadAsync(), WriteAsync(), dos.library/Write() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
