Reference Titles ]" border=0> The reason someone purchases or uses a reference title is for the information contained within. A reference application should not have any of the following: 26. Inaccurate reference data. Imagine you're a student doing a homework assignment, using the CDTV title as a reference work. Your teacher gives you an ``F'' because your facts are wrong. 27. Missing information. If a menu, icon or other reference indicates that information relating to the subject matter is available, the information should be accessible from that point. In other words, if something is selectable, it must present the data associated with it. 28. An inability to accept keyboard input, print, or save to disk even though most people will not be able to take advantage of these features at the moment. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
