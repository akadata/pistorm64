Audio.device ]" border=0> * Now not initialized until used. This means low memory open failure is possible. Check your return values from OpenDevice(). This also means audio.device cannot be opened during 2.0 Strap unless InitResident()ed first. If OpenDevice() of audio.device fails during strap, you must FindResident()/InitResident() audio.device, and then try OpenDevice() again. There will be a small memory loss (until reboot) generated by the first opener of audio.device or narrator.device (memory used in building of audio.device's base). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
