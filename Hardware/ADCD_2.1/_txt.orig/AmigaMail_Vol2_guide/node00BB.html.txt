Iconifying ]" border=0> Although the zoom gadget provides a pseudo-iconifying feature, the Workbench's AppIcon and AppMenuItem features provide true iconification. To iconify a window, create the AppIcon or AppMenuItem that will replace the window. Next, store the state of the window (like its current position or the state of its gadgets), so the application can restore the window to its original state when the application reopens it. Now close the window. Because it is possible for the AddAppIcon() or AddAppMenuItem() function to fail, It is important to create the AppIcon or AppMenuItem before closing the window. If an application closes the window first and Workbench can't create the AppIcon or AppMenuItem, there will be no AppIcon or AppMenuItem for the user to select to uniconify the window. An application can set up a gadget or menu item so the user can tell the application to iconify the window. If the application uses a gadget to iconify, it should not put the gadget in the window border because there is no standard "look" to what an iconify gadget should look like. The last example, hide.c , shows how to use AppIcons and AppMenuItems to iconify a window. hide.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
