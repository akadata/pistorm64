Interconnection ]" border=0> The boopsi gadgets in boopsi1.c are not very powerful. The gadgets work independently of each other, forcing the application to unify them. It is possible to make gadget objects update each other without the application's intervention. Gadgetclass defines two attributes used in this updating process: ICA_Target and ICA_Map. The ICA_Target attribute specifies a pointer to a target object. If an object's attribute changes (and the OM_NOTIFY method applies to that attribute), the object sends itself an OM_NOTIFY message. If the object has a target object, the target will receive an OM_UPDATE message which usually tells the target to set one of its own attributes. For example, when the user slides the knob of a propgclass object, its PGA_Top attribute changes. If this object has a second propgclass object as its target, the second object will receive an OM_UPDATE message and will set its corresponding PGA_Top attribute to the PGA_Top value of the first propgclass object. Because objects of different classes do not always have corresponding attributes, there is a way to map attributes of one object to the attributes of another. The ICA_Map accepts a TagItem array of attribute pairs. The first entry in the pair is the source attribute ID and the second is the target object's attribute. For example, an ICA_Map that maps a prop gadget's PGA_Top attribute to a string gadget's STRINGA_LongVal attribute would look like this: struct TagItem slidertostring[] = { {PGA_Top, STRINGA_LongVal}, {TAG_END, } }; Note that the OM_UPDATE method has to apply to the target attribute for the change to take place. Although the gadget attributes ICA_Target and ICA_Map allow boopsi gadgets to update each other, by themselves these attributes do not provide the application with any information on changes to the gadgets. Instead of using another gadget as a target object, an object targets an icclass object. Icclass (or InterConnection) objects are simple information forwarders. Icclass defines two attributes: ICA_Target and ICA_Map, which are almost identical to the gadgetclass attributes. The difference is that icclass objects can send the application an IDCMPUPDATE IntuiMessage when it receives an OM_UPDATE. If an icclass object receives an OM_UPDATE, it will send the IntuiMessage only if the icclass object's ICA_Target is ICTARGET_IDCMP and the updated attribute is mapped to a special dummy attribute, ICSPECIAL_CODE. The IntuiMessage's Code field contains the lower 16 bits of the updated attribute. Icclass has a more powerful subclass called modelclass. A modelclass object sends OM_UPDATE messages to an entire list of objects that the modelclass object maintains. This makes it possible for gadgets to update each other and for the application to find out about the changes. A modelclass object "broadcasts" attribute changes to its list of boopsi objects and it also lets the application know about attribute changes because it inherits the ICTARGET_IDCMP mechanism from icclass. To add objects to a modelclass object's list, use the OM_ADDMEMBER method. The power of icclass and modelclass lies in using them to create a custom subclass. Consider a group of prop gadgets each of which is used to control one of a color's R, G, B, H, S, and V components. When the user changes one of the color components with a prop gadget, the custom model will be notified of that change and, because it is customized for this specific purpose, it will recalculate the values for the remaining components. The model will then let the rest of the prop gadget objects (which are attached to icclass objects in the custom model's personal list) know about the changes to their component values so they can move their slider to its new position. All this work is done by the objects themselves; the application does not have to process any of the intermediate input. In general, boopsi's power lies in its Intuition-supported extensibility. Using the existing boopsi classes as a foundation, you can create entirely new subclasses. This makes it possible to create your own custom gadgetry and have it work perfectly with Intuition, just like any existing gadget. New subclasses of modelclass can be used to create gadgets that talk directly to ARexx or the clipboard device. If new classes are general enough, they can be made public so other applications can use them. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
