Running a Program ]" border=0> To actually invoke a program on your process, use RunCommand()--it does special compatibility magic that keeps certain third-party applications working properly. If RunCommand() fails due to lack of memory, it returns -1 (normally success!). In this case, check IoErr(). If it is equal to ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE, then RunCommand() really ran out of memory. Note that RunCommand() stuffs a copy of your arguments into the buffer of the input handle for use by ReadArgs(), and un-stuffs them when the program exits. Also note that RunCommand() takes stack size in bytes, and cli_DefaultStack is the size of the stack in LONGs. After the program has completed, free the Lock in pr_HomeDir and set it to NULL. Re-setup your I/O handles with SelectInput() on cli_CurrentInput and SelectOutput() on cli_StandardOutput. It's a good idea to NULL cli_Module here as well, as it can make your exit/cleanup logic easier. You must eat any unused buffered input. Here's some tricky code that does that (read the Autodocs to figure it out if you wish): ch = UnGetC(Input(),-1) ? 0 : '\n'; while ((ch != '\n') && (ch != END_STREAM_CH)) ch = FGetC(Input()); Note: ENDSTREAMCH is EOF (-1). Newer include files #define this in and . To finish the main input loop, use the code below or something like it. This keeps compatibility with certain hacks people had figured out about 1.3 (See SYSTEM and NOTSCRIPT #defines above). /* for compatibility */ /* system exit special case - taken only if they have played */ /* around with the input stream */ if (SYSTEM && NOTSCRIPT) break; } while (ch != ENDSTREAMCH); EndCLI sets fh_End = 0, which causes FGetC() to call replenish(), which returns ENDSTREAMCH on fh_End == 0. EndCLI also sets cli_Background! This neatly avoids a prompt after EndCLI. After you've gotten an EOF (falling out of the while(ch != ENDSTREAMCH) statement above), you need to check if the shell was executing a script file. For Execute-type scripts, if (cli_CurrentInput != cli_StandardInput) is true, the shell was executing a script. If this is the case, you'll need to Close() the cli_CurrentInput, and DeleteFile() the temporary file cli_CommandFile, if there is a file name there. Next, set cli_CurrentInput to cli_StandardInput, and restore the fail level. Then you go back to your normal input loop and accept commands again. Note: this is based on handling scripts in the same manner as the BootShell--you may handle them in different ways. On EOF, you also need to check if this is a System() call. The check for a System() call is ((fn & 0x80000004) == 0x80000004). If you had been handling a System() call, or if the shell was not executing a script, you should go to your cleanup code to exit.
