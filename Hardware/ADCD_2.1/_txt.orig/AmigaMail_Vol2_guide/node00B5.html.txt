AppWindows ]" border=0> The workbench.library's AddAppWindow() call makes an application's Intuition window into an AppWindow. It has one parameter that is different from the other AddApp calls, a window pointer. The mywindow field (from the prototype above) must point to an open Intuition window that is on the Workbench screen. The C source code example AppWindow.c at the end of this article is a simple example of how to create an AppWindow. There are two interesting things to note about the AppWindow. First, because an AppWindow is still an Intuition window, an application can use a Workbench AppWindow for any purpose it would need a normal Workbench based window for. An application can render graphics and text in it, process its IntuiMessages, or create menus for it. Also, because Workbench tells where on an AppWindow icons were dropped, an application can use a small region of a window as a drop box rather than the entire AppWindow. A program can even have several drop boxes on the same window. Using simple rendering routines, an application can draw the boxes so the user can see where to drop icons.
