File Pattern Matching and Multiple Selects ]" border=0> A file requester can filter out certain file and directory entries using dos.library's ``wildcarding''. Turning on a file requester's ``wildcarding'' requires using the ASL_FuncFlags tag. This tag passes a bit field to a requester to set several options. The options are specific to the type of requester (file or font). The bitmasks are defined in . The ASL_FuncFlags's FILF_PATGAD flag toggles the file requester's ``Pattern'' gadget. The user can type an AmigaDOS wildcard pattern into this gadget that the requester uses to limit the file names that appear in the requester. An application can supply the ``Pattern'' gadget with a default pattern matching string using the ASL_Pattern tag. Another feature of the ASL file requester is multiple selection. When an application sets up a file requester, it can set the FILF_MULTISELECT flag in the ASL_FuncFlags tag that allows the user to select several files at once. When the user selects several files in the requester, the FileRequester's rf_NumArgs field contains the number of files selected. When the FILF_MULTISELECT bit is not set, rf_NumArgs is 0. If rf_NumArgs is not zero, rf_ArgList is a base pointer to an array of WBArg structures (defined in ). There is a WBArg structure for each file the user selected. The example FilePat.c illustrates multiple selection. FilePat.c also introduces a new function and a new tag. APTR AllocAslRequestTags( unsigned long type, Tag Tag1, ... ); BOOL AslRequestTags( APTR request, Tag Tag1, ... ); FilePat.c uses AllocAslRequestTags() instead of AllocAslRequest() to allocate and set up the file requester. AllocAslRequestTags() is an Amiga.lib function that accepts tag pairs in its parameter list, rather than a pointer to a tag list. AslRequestTags() also accepts tag pairs.
