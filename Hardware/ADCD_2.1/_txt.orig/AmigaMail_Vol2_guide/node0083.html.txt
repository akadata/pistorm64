III-11: 68040 Compatibility Warning ]" border=0> by Michael Sinz editor's note: the new exec.library routines referred to in this article are part of the 2.04 OS release. Now that Motorola's 68040ä CPU is available, it will not be long before it appears in Amiga-based products. In fact, many Amiga magazines already have ads for 3rd party 68040 CPU cards. The 68040 is a much more powerful CPU than its predecessors. It has 4K of cache memory for instructions and another 4K cache for data. The reason for these two separate caches is so that the CPU core can access data and CPU instructions at the same time. Although the 68040 provides greater performance it also brings with it greater compatibility problems. Just the fact that the caches are so much larger than Motorola's 68030 CPU can cause problems. However, this is not its biggest obstacle. The 68040 data cache has a mode that can make the system run much faster in most cases. It is called CopyBack mode. When a program writes data to memory in this mode, the data goes into the cache but not into the physical RAM. That means that if a program or a piece of hardware were to read that RAM without going through the data cache on the 68040, it will read old data. CopyBack mode effects two areas of the Amiga: DMA devices and the CPU's instruction reading. CopyBack mode effects DMA devices because they read and write data directly to memory. Using DMA with CopyBack mode requires a cache flush. If a DMA device needs to read RAM via DMA, it must first make sure that data in the caches has been written to memory. It can do this by calling the Exec function CachePreDMA(). If a DMA device is about to write to memory, it should call CachePreDMA() before the write, do the DMA write, and then call CachePostDMA(), which makes sure that the CPU uses the data just written to memory. An added advantage of using the CachePreDMA() and CachePostDMA() functions is that they give the OS the chance to tell the DMA device that the physical addresses and memory sizes are not the same. This will make it possible in the future to add features such as virtual memory. See the Autodocs for more information on these calls (the Autodocs have been included in this article). The other major compatibility problem with the 68040's CopyBack mode is with fetching CPU instructions. CPU instructions have to be loaded into memory so the CPU can copy them into its instruction cache. Normally, instructions that will beexecuted are written to memory by the CPU (i.e. loading a program from disk). In CopyBack mode, anything the CPU writes to memory, including CPU instructions, doesn't actually go into memory, it goes into the data cache. If instructions are not flushed out of the data cache to RAM, the 68040 will not be able to find them when it tries to copy them into the instruction cache for execution. It will instead find and attempt to execute whatever garbage data happened to be left at that location in RAM. To remedy this, any program that writes instructions to memory must flush the data cache after writing. The V37 Exec function CacheClearU() takes care of this. Release 2.0 of the Amiga OS correctly flushes the caches as needed after it does the LoadSeg() of a program (LoadSeg() loads Amiga executable programs into memory from disk). Applications need to do the same if they write code to memory. One such example was the article ``Creating Multiple Processes with Re-entrant Code'' from the November/December 1989 issue of Amiga Mail (Volume I). For that example to work with the 68040's CopyBack mode, it needs to flush the cache before it asks the system to execute the code it wrote to memory (which may still be in the cache). It can do that by calling CacheClearU() before the call to CreateProc(). In C that would be: extern struct ExecBase *SysBase; . . . /* If we are in 2.0, call CacheClearU() before CreateProc() */ if (SysBase->LibNode.lib_Version >= 37) CacheClearU(); /* Now do the CreateProc() call... */ proc=CreateProc(... /* whatever your call is like */ ...); . . . For those of you programming in assembly: ************************************************************************** * Check to see if we are running in V37 ROM or better. If so, * we want to call CacheClearU() to make sure we are safe on future * hardware such as the 68040. This section of code assumes that * a6 points at ExecBase. a0/a1/d0/d1 are trashed in CacheClearU() * cmpi.w #37,LIB_VERSION(a6) ; Check if exec is >= V37 bcs.s TooOld ; If less than V37, too old... jsr _LVOCacheClearU(a6) ; Clear the cache... TooOld: * ************************************************************************** Note that CreateProc() is not the only routine where CopyBack mode could be a problem. Any program that copies code into memory for execution that is not done via LoadSeg() (for example, ``Using SetFunction() in a Debugger'' from the March/April 1991 issue of Amiga Mail), you will need to call CacheClearU(). Many input.device handlers have been known to allocate and copy the handler code into memory and then exit back to the system. These programs also need to have this call in them. The above code will work under pre-2.0 versions of the OS, and will do the correct operations in 2.04 (and beyond). Heeding these compatibility guidelines will allow the system to enable CopyBack mode, enhancing the performance of the Amiga considerably. Ignoring these guidelines will prevent the Amiga from taking advantage of CopyBack mode and possibly other advanced features of the 68040 (and beyond).
