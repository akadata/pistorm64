Strap ]" border=0> * romboot.library is gone. * audio.device cannot be OpenDevice()ed by a boot block program because it is not yet InitResident()ed. If OpenDevice() of audio.device fails during strap, you must FindResident()/InitResident() audio.device, and then try OpenDevice() again. * Boot from other floppies (+5,-10,-20,-30) is possible. * Undocumented system stack and register usage at Diag and Boot time have changed.
