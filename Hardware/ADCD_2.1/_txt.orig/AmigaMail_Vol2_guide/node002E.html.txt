Fonts ]" border=0> * Some font format changes (old format supported). * Private format of .font files has changed (use FixFonts to create). * Default fonts may be larger, proportional. * Topaz is now sans-serif. * Any size font will be created via scaling as long as TextAttr.Flags FPF_DESIGNED bit is not set. If you were asking for an extreme size, like size 1 to get smallest available, or 999 to get largest available, you will get a big (or very very small) surprise now. * Do not use -1 for TextAttr.Flags or Styles, nor as the flags for AvailFonts (one high bit now causes AvailFonts to return different structures). Only set what you know you want. A kludge has been added to the OS to protect applications which currently pass -1 for AvailFonts flags. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
