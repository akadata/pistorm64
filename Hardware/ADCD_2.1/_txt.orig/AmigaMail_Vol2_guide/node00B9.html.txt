Public Screens ]" border=0> The public screens introduced in 2.0 make it possible for the user to open several screens where different applications can open windows. If an application allows the user to choose the public screen on which it opens its window, the user can more easily organize their working environment. They can spread their work across several public screens allowing them to use the screen that has the palette or resolution best suited to their purposes. This also buys the user more room for windows. In case one screen gets too cluttered with windows, the user can open an application's window on a different public screen. There are number of ways you can support public screens. If your application uses command line options or reads tooltypes, it can support the PUBSCREEN keyword as a command line argument or tooltype. This lets the user indicate the name of the public screen on which your windows should open. For example, if some developer wrote a new shell that supported public screens, the shell's icon could have the following tooltype in its icon: PUBSCREEN= which tells the shell to open its window on the public screen named pubscreenname. If an application supports ARexx, it can support a JUMPTOSCREEN command that tells it to move, or jump, its window to a specific public screen. The application would open a new window on the public screen named in the JUMPTOSCREEN command and closes its old window. Your application can even provide a jump-to-next-screen gadget, that makes the window jump to the next public screen. By using the intuition.library NextPubScreen(), your application can get the name of the next screen in the public screen list, close its window on the current screen and re-open it on the next. The example program jumpy.c opens a window which jumps from one screen to another when the user clicks the jump gadget. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
