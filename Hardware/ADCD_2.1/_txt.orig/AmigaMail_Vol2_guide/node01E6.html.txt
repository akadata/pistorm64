sana2.device/CMD_READ ]" border=0> NAME Read -- Get a packet from the network. FUNCTION Get the next packet available of the requested packet type. The data copied (via a call to the requestor-provided CopyToBuffer function) into ios2_Data is normally the Data Link Layer packet data only. If bit SANA2IOB_RAW is set in ios2_Flags, then the entire physical frame will be returned. Unlike most Exec devices, SANA-II device drivers do not have internal buffers. If you wish to read data from a SANA-II device you should have multiple CMD_READ requests pending at any given time. The functions provided by you the requestor will be used for any incoming packets of the type you've requested. If no read requests are outstanding for a type which comes in and no read_orphan requests are outstanding, the packet will be lost. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - CMD_READ ios2_Flags - Supported flags are: SANA2IOB_RAW SANA2IOB_QUICK ios2_PacketType - Packet type desired. ios2_Data - Abstract data structure to hold packet data. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. ios2_Flags - The following flags may be returned: SANA2IOB_RAW SANA2IOB_BCAST SANA2IOB_MCAST ios2_SrcAddr - Source interface address of packet. ios2_DstAddr - Destination interface address of packet. ios2_DataLength - Length of packet data. ios2_Data - Abstract data structure which packet data is contained in. NOTES The driver may not directly examine or modify anything pointed to by ios2_Data. It *must* use the requester-provided functions to access this data.
