II-37: Using the AmigaDOS Pattern Matching Functions ]" border=0> by Ewout Walraven One of the additions made to dos.library for release 2.0 is a series of functions to do standard pattern matching. Using a set of standard string matching tokens, any application can use these functions to test if a particular string matches a pattern. The Amiga OS uses these functions for processing file name strings for its new directory scanning functions. These functions can be used in every circumstance where you would like to enable the user to enter a pattern to indicate more than one target string. Using these functions not only makes it unnecessary to implement your own pattern matching routines, but by using the familiar DOS pattern tokens in your application, it is easier for the user to learn how to use your application.
