sana2.device/S2_MULTICAST ]" border=0> NAME Multicast -- Multicast a packet on network. FUNCTION This command works the same as CMD_WRITE except that it also performs whatever special processing of the packet is required to do a multicast send. The actual multicast mechanism is neccessarily network/interface/device specific. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - S2_MULTICAST. ios2_Flags - Supported flags are: SANA2IOB_RAW SANA2IOB_QUICK ios2_PacketType - Packet type to send. ios2_DstAddr - Destination interface address for this packet. ios2_DataLength - Length of the Data to be sent. ios2_Data - Abstract data structure which packet data is contained in. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. This command can fail for many reasons and is not supported by all networks and/or network interfaces. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. NOTES The address supplied in ios2_DstAddr will be sanity checked (if possible) by the driver. If the supplied address fails this sanity check, the multicast request will fail immediately with ios2_Error set to S2WERR_BAD_MULTICAST. Another Amiga will not receive a multicast packet unless it has had the particular multicast address being used S2_ADDMULTICASTADRESS'd.
