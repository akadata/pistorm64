Hardware Type ]" border=0> The HardwareType returned by the device's S2_DEVICEQUERY function is necessary for those protocols whose standards require different behavior on different hardware. It is also useful for determining appropriate packet type numbers to use with the device. The HardwareType values already issued for standard network hardware are the same as those in RFC 1060 (assigned numbers). Hardware developers implementing networks without a SANA-II hardware number must contact CATS to have a new hardware type number assigned. Driver users should all have reasonable defaults which can be used for hardware with which they are not familiar. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
