Automating Version Numbering with Bumprev ]" border=0> The bumprev tool and the include files it creates are what we use internally to give version numbers to system ROM modules, disk-based devices and libraries, and 2.0 Workbench and Extras commands. Bumprev creates or updates three files -- a name_rev.rev file which contains the current revision number, and the C and assembler include files called name_rev.h and name_rev.i. These include files contain #defines (.h) or macros (.i) to define the name, version, revision, and date of your program in a variety of string and numeric formats. By using the appropriate include file in one or more of your code modules, you can use these #defines (or macros) in place of hardcoded version and revision information. This way, whenever you ``bumprev'' your revision files and recompile (or reassemble) your program, all version, revision, and date references in your program will be automatically updated. You can even include a bumprev call in your makefile for automatic revision bumping on every make (although this can update the version number more often than is really necessary). The usage of bumprev is: bumprev For example: bumprev 37 myapp_rev The first time you use the above example bumprev call, it creates a myapp_rev.rev file containing ``1'', and myapp_rev.h and .i files containing a variety of version and revision #defines (or macros) for version 37.1. The next time you use the same bumprev command it updates the files so that all #defines (or macros) are for version 37.2. Bumprev does have some caveats. If you accidently type ``bumprev 37 myapp'' (instead of myapp_rev), bumprev will gladly overwrite any myapp.h or myapp.i file you happen to have rather than complain or automatically insert _rev into the output file names. Also, to make a major version switch (for example from 36 to 37), you must first delete the myapp_rev.rev file to make bumprev start the revisions over again at 1. Note that the 2.0 convention is for a major version number of 37 (to match the OS major version). Here are example _rev.h and _rev.i files as generated by bumprev, and fragments of C and assembler code which include and reference these files. Example myapp_rev.h generated by bumprev: #define VERSION 37 #define REVISION 1 #define DATE "20.3.91" #define VERS "myapp 37.1" #define VSTRING "myapp 37.1 (20.3.91)\n\r" #define VERSTAG "\0$VER: myapp 37.1 (20.3.91)" Code example which includes myapp_rev.h: /* myapp.c */ #include #include /* stdlib.h and stdio.h contain prototypes for exit and printf. * Amiga.lib IO users could instead use * and */ #include #include #include "myapp_rev.h" /* NOTE: we reference VERSTAG version string for C:VERSION to find */ UBYTE versiontag[] = VERSTAG; /* NOTE: we concatenate program name and version (VERS) with our copyright */ UBYTE Copyright[] = VERS "Copyright(c) 1991 CATS Inc. All Rights Reserved"; void main(int argc,char **argv) { /* Print our Copyright string. * Copyright string includes our myapp _rev.h version and date */ printf("%s\n",Copyright); exit(RETURN_OK); } Example mylib_rev.i generated by bumprev: VERSION EQU 37 REVISION EQU 1 DATE MACRO dc.b '20.3.91' ENDM VERS MACRO dc.b 'mylib 37.1' ENDM VSTRING MACRO dc.b 'mylib 37.1 (20.3.91)',13,10,0 ENDM VERSTAG MACRO dc.b 0,'$VER: mylib 37.1 (20.3.91)',0 ENDM Code example which includes mylib_rev.i: * This is an example of an initial library code module * Mylib_rev.i is generated with bumprev nolist include "exec/types.i" include "exec/initializers.i" include "exec/libraries.i" include "exec/resident.i" include "mylib.i" include "mylib_rev.i" ; Bumprev revision include file list ; external xref InitLib ; init function xref FuncTable ; function table xref EndSkip ; End of code segment ; code at start of file in case anyone tries to execute library as program entry FalseStart FalseStart moveq #-1,d0 rts ResidentNode dc.w RTC_MATCHWORD ; RT_MATCHWORD dc.l ResidentNode ; RT_MATCHTAG dc.l EndSkip ; RT_ENDSKIP dc.b RTF_AUTOINIT ; RT_FLAGS dc.b VERSION ; RT_VERSION ;From mylib_rev.i dc.b NT_LIBRARY ; RT_TYPE dc.b 0 ; RT_PRI dc.l LibName ; RT_NAME dc.l IDString ; RT_IDString ;Contains VSTRING dc.l InitTable ; RT_SIZE ; from mylib_rev.i LibName: DC.B 'mylib.library',0 IDString: VSTRING ;From mylib_rev.i CNOP 0,2 InitTable dc.l XMyLibBase_Size dc.l FuncTable dc.l DataTable dc.l InitLib DataTable ; standard library stuff INITBYTE LN_TYPE,NT_LIBRARY INITLONG LN_NAME,LibName INITBYTE LIB_FLAGS,LIBF_SUMUSED!LIBF_CHANGED INITWORD LIB_VERSION,VERSION ;From mylib_rev.i INITWORD LIB_REVISION,REVISION ;From mylib_rev.i INITLONG LIB_IDSTRING,IDString ;Contains VSTRING ; from mylib_rev.i ; library specific stuff ; end of init list dc.l 0 end [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
