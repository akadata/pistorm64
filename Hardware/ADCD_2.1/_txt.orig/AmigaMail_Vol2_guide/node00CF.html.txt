V-23: Using Compugraphic Typefaces with Bullet ]" border=0> by John Orr One of the improvements made to the Amiga's operating system for Workbench Release 2.1 is programmatic control of AGFA's IntelliFontÒ scaling engine. With this engine, application programs can fully utilize Compugraphic (CG) typefaces installed by Fountain (the CG typeface install that comes with 2.04 and 2.1). Some of the features that the font scaling engine offers include: * Rasterization of a typeface to arbitrary vertical and horizontal resolutions. * Baseline rotation of glyphs to an arbitrary angle. * Glyph shearing (italicizing) to any angle from -45 to 45 degrees (inclusive). * Access to kerning tables. * Algorithmic emboldening.
