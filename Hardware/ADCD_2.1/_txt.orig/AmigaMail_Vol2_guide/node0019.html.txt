The Font Requester ]" border=0> The ASL library also contains a font requester. The default font requester consists of two scrolling lists, one containing font names, the other containing font sizes. Each scrolling list is accompanied by a string gadget which lets the user type in the name and size of the font they want. Figure 2 - The FontReq.c font requester The font size string gadget (actually, an integer gadget) is especially useful because it allows the user to type in a font size that doesn't appear in the font size scrolling list. If the font size the user requests does not already exist in the system, the Amiga can generate the font size the user requests either through bitmap scaling, or, if scalable outline fonts are available, by scaling an outline font. Using the font requester is similar to using the file requester. First, allocate a requester structure. A font requester requires the FontRequester structure: struct FontRequester { APTR fo_Reserved1[2]; struct TextAttr fo_Attr; /* Returned TextAttr */ UBYTE fo_FrontPen; /* Returned pens, if selected */ UBYTE fo_BackPen; UBYTE fo_DrawMode; APTR fo_UserData; }; To allocate this structure, use AllocAslRequest() or AllocAslRequestTags() with the first argument set to ASL_FontRequest. There are several tags that are specific to the font requester: ASL_FontName ASL_FontHeight ASL_FontStyles ASL_FontFlags ASL_FrontPen ASL_BackPen ASL_MinHeight ASL_MaxHeight ASL_ModeList The first six tags are used to place initial values into the FontRequester structure. They correspond respectively to the FontRequester's fo_Attr.ta_Name, fo_Attr.ta_YSize, fo_Attr.ta_Style, fo_Attr.ta_Flags, fo_FrontPen, and fo_BackPen fields. ASL_MinHeight specifies the minimum Y height that the font requester should list. ASL_MaxHeight specifies the maximum Y height that the font requester should list. Note that these tags only limit the range of font sizes that the font requester displays, the user is free to type in any value. The ASL_ModeList tag specifies the strings used for the font requester's drawing mode gadget. This is discussed later in the chapter. The are several options available to the font requester that are toggled by setting flags with the ASL_FuncFlags tag. These flags are: FONF_FRONTCOLOR FONF_BACKCOLOR FONF_STYLES FONF_FIXEDWIDTH FONF_DRAWMODE A simple font requester (one without any of the above FONF_ flags set) only lets the user choose a font and a Y size. Setting the flags above adds options to the font requester. FONF_FRONTCOLOR and FONF_BACKCOLOR add color selection gadgets to the requester, one for choosing a font's foreground color (labeled ``Text'' on the requester) and the other for choosing the backround color (labeled ``Field''). The font requester records the user's setting in the FontRequester's fo_FrontPen and fo_BackPen fields. FONF_STYLES sets up several gadgets to choose the style of the font (bold, italics, underline). The font requester saves these setting in the fo_Attr.ta_Style bit field according to the style flags defined in . FONF_FIXEDWIDTH limits the font name display to fixed width (non-proportional) fonts (note that this does not prevent the user from typing in a proportional font name). FONF_DRAWMODE adds a cycle gadget to the font requester so the user can choose the draw mode. The draw mode is saved in the requester's fo_DrawMode field. The number stored there corresponds to the draw mode's position in the gadget's cycle. The draw mode cycle gadget initially is labeled ``Mode'' and has three elements in its cycle: ``JAM1'', ``JAM2'', and ``Complement''. These yield a result of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. It is possible to change the names and number of draw modes with the ASL_ModeList tag. This tag accepts a pointer to an array of strings. The first string replaces ``Mode'' as the label for the draw mode cycle gadget. The strings that follow replace the elements of the cycle gadget. The last entry in the array has to be NULL to tell the requester where the list of entries ends. The FontReq.c example illustrates how to use a font requester. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
