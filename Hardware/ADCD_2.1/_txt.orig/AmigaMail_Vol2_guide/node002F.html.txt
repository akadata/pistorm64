CLI / Shell ]" border=0> * Many more commands are now built-in (no longer in C:). This can break installation scripts that copy C:commandname, and programs that try to Lock() or Open() C:commandname to check for the command's existence. * The limit of 20 CLI processes is gone and the DOSBase CLI table has changed to accomodate this. Under V36 and higher, you should use new 2.0 functions rather than accessing the CLI table directly. * Shell windows now have Close Gadgets. The EOF character is passed for the Close Gadget of a Shell. This is -1L with CON: getchar(), and the Close Gadget raw event ESC seq with RAW:. * Shells now use the simple-refresh character-mapped console (see Console notes). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
