PPRF (0x50505249) / Page preferences / ]" border=0> The PPRF chunk contains preference settings for ProVector. Although this chunk is not required, its use is encouraged because it contains some important environment information. struct PPRFstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; char Prefs[Size]; }; DR2D stores preferences as a concatenation of several null-terminated strings, in the Prefs[] array. The strings can appear in any order. The currently supported strings are: Units= Portrait= PageType= GridSize= where: is either Inch, Cm, or Pica is either True or False is either Standard, Legal, B4, B5, A3, A4, A5, or Custom is a floating-point number The DR2D FORM does not require this chunk to explicitly state all the possible preferences. In the absence of any particular preference string, a DR2D reader should fall back on the default value. The defaults are: Units=Inch Portrait=True PageType=Standard GridSize=1.0 [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
