Only call this function on a private copy of a KeyMap (including its data). INPUTS mykeymap = pointer to a KeyMap structure. AlterAppKeyMap() will make changes to this KeyMap's data, so this KeyMap should be a private copy of a KeyMap (including the data the KeyMap points to). keyarray = pointer to an array of struct MyKey (from appkeymap.h): struct MyKey { UBYTE RawCode; /* RawCode of character to change */ /* in the KeyMap. Correponds to the */ /* Lo/HiKeyMap structures from the */ /* KeyMap structure. */ UBYTE MapType; /* The Lo/HiKeyMapTypes field. */ UBYTE Capsable; /* This TRUE/FALSE state of this bit */ /* gets translated to the correspond- */ /* bit in KeyMap.Lo/HiCapsable. */ UBYTE Repeatable; /* This TRUE/FALSE state of this bit */ /* gets translated to the correspond- */ /* bit in KeyMap.Lo/HiRepeatable. */ ULONG Map; /* Map data for key. This points to */ /* data for the rawkey. Its format */ /* depends on the key type. This field */ /* correponds to KeyMap.Lo/HiKeyMap. */ }; arrayentries = The number of MyKey entries in keyarray. RESULT For each MyKey entry in keyarray, AlterKeyMap() finds the correpsonding raw key entry in mykeymap and changes the data to match the entry in keyarray. AlterKeyMap() makes changes directly to the KeyMap's data, so don't call this function on a system copy of a keymap, make a copy of it. Note that the console.device's CD_ASKKEYMAP only copies a KeyMap structure, which is only a set of pointers. If you want to customize a copy of a keymap, you also have to duplicate the data that the KeyMap references. If you do not duplicate the keymap data when customizing a keymap, you'll write over data that many keymaps are currently using. This function assumes that the keymap passed to it was duplicated using the CreateAppKeyMap() function. CreateAppKeyMap() puts the keymap tables in a specific order and AlterAppKeyMap() expects to find the tables in that order. Only call AlterAppKeyMap() on keymaps duplicated with CreateAppKeyMap().

SYNOPSIS newkeymap = CreateAppKeyMap(origkeymap); struct KeyMap *CreateAppKeyMap(struct KeyMap *); FUNCTION This function accepts a pointer to a KeyMap structure and duplicates it. CreateAppKeyMap() allocates the memory for a KeyMap structure and all the tables associated with that keymap. INPUTS origkeymap = points to a KeyMap to duplicate. RESULT If successful, this function returns a pointer to a duplicate of origkeymap. CreateAppKeyMap() duplicates all of the tables that origkeymap references, so an application can make changes to the duplicate. If CreateAppKeyMap() fails, it returns NULL. The DeleteAppKeyMap() function deallocates the resources allocated by CreateAppKeyMap(). CreateAppKeyMap() places the duplicate tables in an order so that a "Lo" table (for example, KeyMap.km_LoKeyMap) is immediately followed by the corresponding "Hi" table (KeyMap.km_HiKeyMap). This allows application to reference the two tables as one using the raw key value as an index.

SYNOPSIS DeleteAppKeyMap(mykeymap); void DeleteAppKeyMap(struct KeyMap *); FUNCTION This function accepts a pointer to a keymap allocated by CreateAppKeyMap() and deallocates the resources allocated by that function. INPUTS mykeymap = points to a KeyMap to deallocate. RESULT Frees memory previously used by mykeymap and its associated tables.
