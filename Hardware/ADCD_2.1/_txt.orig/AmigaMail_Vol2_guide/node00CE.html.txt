Some Things to Look Out For ]" border=0> One misleading thing about the TA_DeviceDPI tag is that its name implies that the diskfont.library is going to scale the font glyphs according to an actual DPI (dots per inch) value. As far as scaling is concerned, this tag serves only as a way to specify the aspect ratio, so the actual values of the X and Y elements are not important, just the ratio of one to the other. A font glyph will look the same if the ratio is 2:1 or 200:100 as these two ratios are equal. To makes things a little more complicated, when diskfont.library scales a bitmap font using an aspect ratio, the X and Y DPI values that the OS stores in the font's TextFontExtension are identical to the X and Y DPI values passed in the TA_DeviceDPI tag. This means the system can associate an X and Y DPI value to an open font size that is very different from the font size's actual X and Y DPI. For this reason, applications should not use these values as real DPI values. Instead, only use them to calculate a ratio. For the Compugraphic outline fonts, things are a little different. The X and Y DPI values are built into the font outline and reflect a true X and Y DPI. When the diskfont.library creates a font from an outline, scaling it according to an application-supplied aspect ratio, diskfont.library does not change the YDPI setting. Instead, it calculates a new XDPI based on the font's YDPI value and the aspect ratio passed in the TA_DeviceDPI tag. It does this because the Amiga thinks of a font size as being a height in pixels. If an application was able to change the true Y DPI of a font, the diskfont.library would end up creating font sizes that were much larger or smaller than the YSize the application asked for. If an application needs to scale a font according to height as well as width, the application can adjust the value of the YSize it asks for in the TTextAttr. As mentioned earlier, almost all of the system standard bitmap fonts do not have a built in aspect ratio. This means that if an application loads one of these bitmap fonts without supplying an aspect ratio, the system will not put a TA_DeviceDPI tag in the font's TextFontExtension: the font will not have an aspect ratio. If a font size that is already in the system font list does not have an associated X and Y DPI, the diskfont.library cannot create a new font of the same size with a different aspect ratio. The reason for this is the diskfont.library cannot tell the difference between two instances of the same font size where one has an aspect ratio and the other does not. Because diskfont.library cannot see this difference, when an application asks, for example, for Topaz-8 with an aspect ratio of 2:1, OpenDiskFont() first looks through the system list to see if that font is loaded. OpenDiskFont() happens to find the ROM font Topaz-8 in the system font list, which has no X and Y DPI. Because it cannot see the difference, diskfont.library thinks it has found what it was looking for, so it does not create a new Topaz-8 with an aspect ratio of 2:1, and instead opens the Topaz-8 with no aspect ratio. This also causes problems for programs that do not ask for a specific aspect ratio. When an application asks for a font size without specifying an aspect ratio, OpenDiskFont() will not consider the aspect ratios of fonts in the system font list when it is looking for a matching font. If a font of the same font and style is already in the system font list, even though it may have a wildly distorted aspect ratio, OpenDiskFont() will return the font already in the system rather than creating a new one. Due to a bug in the 2.00 through 2.04 versions of the graphics.library function WeighTAMatch(), the OS ignores the aspect ratio of a font when trying to determine if the TTextAttr passed to OpenDiskFont() matches a font already in the system font list. If an application asks for a font that exactly matches a font already in the font list in all ways except in aspect ratio, OpenDiskFont() will open the font in the system font list rather than creating a font with a matching aspect ratio. For example, if an application requests CGTimes-20 with an aspect ratio of 1:2 and while scanning through the system font list OpenDiskFont() finds CGtimes-20 with an aspect ratio of 1:1, OpenDiskFont() will open the font with a 1:1 aspect ratio. A patch that temporarily fixes this bug, SetPatchWTAM, is on the Denver/Milano DevCon disks. The following example, cliptext.c , renders the contents of a text file to a Workbench window. This example gets the new aspect ratio for a font by asking the display database what the aspect ratio of the current display mode is. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
