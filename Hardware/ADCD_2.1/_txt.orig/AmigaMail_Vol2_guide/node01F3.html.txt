sana2.device/S2_GETSPECIALSTATS ]" border=0> NAME GetSpecialStats -- Get network type specific statistics. FUNCTION This function returns statistics which are specific to the type of network medium this driver controls. For example, this command could return statistics common to all Ethernets which are not common to all network mediums in general. The supplied Sana2SpecialStatData structure is given below: struct Sana2SpecialStatData { ULONG RecordCountMax; ULONG RecordCountSupplied; struct Sana2StatRecord[RecordCountMax]; }; The format of the data returned is: struct Sana2StatRecord { ULONG Type; /* commodore registered */ LONG Count; /* the stat itself */ char *String; /* null terminated */ }; The RecordCountMax field specifies the number of records that the caller is prepared to accomodate. RecordCountSupplied is the number of record actually supplied which will not exceed RecordCountMax. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - S2_GETSPECIALSTATS. ios2_StatData - Pointer to a Sana2SpecialStatData structure to fill. RecordCountMax must be initialized. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. NOTES Commodore will maintain registered statistic Types.
