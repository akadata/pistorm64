MultiDirectory Assigns ]" border=0> As of V36 it is possible to have a logical device assignment to more than one directory (see the dos.library Autodocs for AssignLock()/AssignAdd()). Since the user can utilize this with the C:Assign command, it is good practice to support this feature. The shell itself supports multidirectory assigns, although not all C: commands do. In general, when your application is presented with only a device name to scan, you should check if it is an assignment. If it is, use GetDeviceProc() to get the handler for it, process it, and loop until GetDeviceProc() returns NULL, indicating there are no more directories for this assign. See the Autodocs for details. The program Find.c is a more realistic example of the usage of patterns and ExAll() and shows a method of supporting multidirectory assigns. It scans one or more directories or volumes for the occurrence of a particular pattern. This example recursively scans subdirectories which means that Find.c may need more stack space than normal to keep from overflowing the stack. Find.c has two required arguments, a pattern and one or more directories to examine. It has two keywords, FILES and DIRS, to tell it to scan only for files or directories, respectively. The ALL keyword instructs Find.c to recurse into subdirectories when it encounters them. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
