Step 4 ]" border=0> Setting a scaling engine's current typeface involves the SetInfoA() (or SetInfo()) function and the Level 0 tags from . The SetInfoA() function takes two parameters, a pointer to the GlyphEngine structure, and a tag list of level 0 outline tags. The Level 0 tags act as commands for a scaling engine, some of which are for setting scaling engine parameters (with SetInfo() or SetInfoA()), and some of which are for querying information from a scaling engine (with ObtainInfo() or ObtainInfoA()). Two tags set a scaling engine's current typeface: OT_OTagPath and OT_TagList. The OT_OTagPath tag points to the full path name of a typeface's otag file (for example, fonts:CGTimes.otag). The OT_OTagList tag points to the tag list created in step 2 above. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
