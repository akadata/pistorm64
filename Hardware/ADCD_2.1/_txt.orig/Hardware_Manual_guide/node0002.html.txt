Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: 1 Introduction ]" border=0> The Amiga family of computers consists of several models, each of which has been designed on the same premise -- to provide the user with a low-cost computer that features high-cost performance. The Amiga does this through the use of custom silicon hardware that yields advanced graphics and sound features. There are four basic models that make up the Amiga computer family: the A500, A1000, A2000, and A3000. Though the models differ in price and features, they have a common hardware nucleus that makes them software compatible with one another. This chapter describes the Amiga's hardware components and gives a brief overview of its graphics and sound features.
