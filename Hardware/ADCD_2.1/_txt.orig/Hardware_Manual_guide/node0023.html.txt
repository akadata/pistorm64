A Register Summary / BPLxDAT ]" border=0> Agnus/ Read/ Denise/ Register Address Write Paula Function -------- ------- ----- ------- -------- BPLxDAT 110 W D Bitplane x data (parallel-to-serial convert) These registers receive the DMA data fetched from RAM by the bitplane address pointers described above. They may also be written by either microprocessor. They act as a six-word parallel- to-serial buffer for up to six memory bitplanes (x=1-6). The parallel-to-serial conversion is triggered whenever bitplane #1 is written, indicating the completion of all bitplanes for that word (16 pixels). The MSB is output first, and is, therefore, always on the left. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
