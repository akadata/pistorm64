3 / Moving (Scrolling) Playfields / Horizontal Scrolling ]" border=0> You can scroll playfields horizontally from left to right or right to left on the screen. You control the speed of scrolling by specifying the amount of delay in pixels. Delay means that an extra word of data is fetched but not immediately displayed. The extra word is placed just to the left of the window's leftmost edge and before normal data fetch. As the display shifts to the right, the bits in this extra word appear on-screen at the left-hand side of the window as bits on the right-hand side disappear off-screen. For each pixel of delay, the on-screen data shifts one pixel to the right each display field. The greater the delay, the greater the speed of scrolling. You can have up to 15 pixels of delay. In high resolution mode, scrolling is in increments of 2 pixels. Figure 3-24 shows how the delay and extra data fetch combine to cause the scrolling effect. Figure 3-24: Horizontal Scrolling NOTE: Fetching an extra word for scrolling will disable some sprites . To set up a playfield for horizontal scrolling, you need to: * Define bitplanes wide enough to allow for the scrolling you need. * Set the data-fetch registers to correctly place each horizontal line, including the extra word, on the screen. * Set the delay bits. * Set the modulo so that the bitplane pointers begin at the correct word for each line. * Write Copper instructions to handle the changes during the vertical blanking interval.
