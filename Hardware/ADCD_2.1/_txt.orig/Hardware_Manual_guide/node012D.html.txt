6 Blitter Hardware / Blitter Key Points ]" border=0> This is a list of some key points that should be remembered when programming the blitter. * Write BLTSIZE last; writing this register starts the blit. * Modulos and pointers are in bytes; width is in words and height is in pixels. The least significant bit of all pointers and modulos is ignored. * The order of operations in the blitter is masking , shifting , logical combination of sources, area fill , and zero flag setting. * In ascending mode, the blitter increments the pointers, adds the modulos, and shifts to the right. * In descending mode , the blitter decrements the pointers, subtracts the modulos, and shifts to the left. * Area fill only works correctly in descending mode . * Check BLTDONE before writing blitter registers or using the results of a blit. * Shifts are done on immediate data as soon as it is loaded.
