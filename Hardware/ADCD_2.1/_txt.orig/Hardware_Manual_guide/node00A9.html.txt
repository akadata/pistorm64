C / ECS Hardware and the Graphics Library / Genlock Extensions ]" border=0> The V36 graphics.library supports the new genlock capabilities of the enhanced Denise chip in PAL or NTSC modes. Any color registers may be chosen as controlling video overlay (COLORKEY). A single bitplane may be chosen to control video overlay as well (BITPLANEKEY). The border areas surrounding the active display window may also be set to be opaque or transparent.
