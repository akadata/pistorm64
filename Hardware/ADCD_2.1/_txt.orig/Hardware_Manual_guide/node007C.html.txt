3 / Forming a Dual-playfield Display / Activating Dual-Playfield Mode ]" border=0> Writing a 1 to bit 10 (called DBLPF) of the bitplane control register BPLCON0 selects dual-playfield mode. Selecting dual-playfield mode changes both the way the hardware groups the bitplanes for color interpretation -- all odd-numbered bitplanes are grouped together and all even-numbered bitplanes are grouped together, and the way hardware can move the bitplanes on the screen.
