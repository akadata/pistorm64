K / AUTOCONFIG(TM) / The Autoconfig Mechanism ]" border=0> The AUTOCONFIG mechanism used for the Zorro III bus is an extension of the original Zorro II configuration mechanism. The main reason for this is that the Zorro II mechanism works so well, there was little need to change anything. The changes are simply support for new hardware features on the Zorro III bus. Amiga autoconfiguration is surprisingly simple. When an Amiga powers up or resets, every card in the system goes to its unconfigured state. At this point, the most important signals in the system are /CFGINn and /CFGOUTn . As long as a card's /CFGINn line is negated, that card sits quietly and does nothing on the bus (though memory cards should continue to refresh even through reset, and any local board activities that don't concern the bus may take place after /RESET is negated). As part of the unconfigured state, /CFGOUTn is negated by the PIC immediately on reset. The configuration process begins when a card's /CFGINn line is asserted, either by the backplane, if it's the first slot, or via the configuration chain, if it's a later card. The configuration chain simply ensures that only one unconfigured card will see an asserted /CFGINn at one time. An unconfigured card that sees its /CFGINn line asserted will respond to a block of memory called configuration space. In this block, the PIC will assert a set of read-only registers, followed by a set of write-only registers (the read-only registers are also known as AUTOCONFIG ROM). Starting at the base of this block, the read registers describe the device's size, type, and other requirements. The operating system reads these, and based on them, decides what should be written to the board. Some write information is optional, but a board will always be assigned a base address or be told to shut up. The act of writing the final bit of base address, or writing anything to a shutup address, will cause the PIC to assert its /CFGOUTn , enabling the next board in the configuration chain. The Zorro II configuration space is the 64K memory block $00E8xxxx, which of course is driven with 16-bit Zorro II cycles; all Zorro II cards configure there. The Zorro III configuration space is the 64K memory block beginning at $FF00xxxx, which is always driven with 32-bit Zorro III cycles (PICs need only decode A31-A24 during configuration). A Zorro III PIC can configure in Zorro II or Zorro III configuration space, at the designer's discretion, but not both at once. All read registers physically return only the top 4 bits of data, on D31-D28 for either bus mode. Write registers are written to support nybble, byte, and word registers for the same register, again based on what works best in hardware. This design attempts to map into real hardware as simply as possible. Every AUTOCONFIG register is logically considered to be 8 bits wide; the 8 bits actually being nybbles from two paired addresses. $00E80000 _______ |#| | | | a) Zorro II Style Mapping |#|_|_|_| | |_______________________________ |_________________ | | | _______________________________ | | | | | | | | | (00|02) | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___| _________________________________| | | _______________________________________________| | | | | _______ |#| | | | |#|_|_|_| $00E80002 $FF000000 _______________ |#| | | | | | | | b) Zorro III Style Mapping |#|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| | |_______________________________ |_________________ | | | _______________________________ | | | | | | | | | (00|100) | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___| _________________________________| | | _______________________________________________| | | | | _______________ |#| | | | | | | | |#|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| $FF000100 Figure K-17: Configuration Register Mapping The register mappings for the two different blocks are shown in Figure K-17. All the bit patterns mentioned in the following sections are logical values. To avoid ambiguity, all registers are referred to by the number of the first register in the pair, since the first pair member is the same for both mapping schemes. In the actual implementation of these registers, all read registers except for the 00 register are physically complemented; eg, the logical value of register 3C is always 0, which means in hardware, the upper nybbles of locations $00E8003C and $00E8003E, or $FF00003C and $FF00013C, both return all 1s.
