E / / External Disk Interface Specification / Identification Mode ]" border=0> An identification mode is provided for reading a 32-bit serial identification data stream from an external device. To initialize this mode, the motor must be turned on, then off. See pin 8, MTRXD* for a discussion of how to turn the motor on and off. The transition from motor on to motor off reinitializes the serial shift register. After initialization, the SELxB* signal should be left in the inactive state. Now enter a loop where SELxB* is driven active, read serial input data on RDY* (pin 1), and drive SELxB* inactive. Repeat this loop a total of 32 times to read in 32 bits of data. The most significant bit is received first. DEFINED IDENTIFICATIONS ----------------------- $0000 0000 - no drive present. $FFFF FFFF - Amiga standard 3.25 diskette. $5555 5555 - 48 TPI double-density, double-sided. As with other peripheral ID's, users should contact Amiga, Inc. for ID assignment. The serial input data is active low and must therefore be inverted to be consistent with the above table.
