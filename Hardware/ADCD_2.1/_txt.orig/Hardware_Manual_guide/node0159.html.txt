7 / Video Priorities / Setting the Priority Control Register ]" border=0> This register lets you define how objects will pass in front of each other or hide behind each other. Normally, playfield 1 appears in front of playfield 2. The PF2PRI bit reverses this relationship, making playfield 2 more important. You control the video priorities by using the bits in BPLCON2 (for "bitplane control register number 2") as shown in Table 7-1. Table 7-1: Bits in BPLCON2 Bit Number Name Function ------ ---- -------- 15-7 Not used (keep at 0) 6 PF2PRI Playfield 2 priority 5-3 PF2P2 - PF2P0 Playfield 2 placement with respect to the sprites 2-0 PF1P2 - PF1P0 Playfield 1 placement with respect to the sprites The binary values that you give to bits PF1P2-PF1P0 determine where playfield 1 occurs in the priority chain as shown in Table 7-2. This matches the description given in the previous section. Be careful: ----------- PF2P2 - PF2P0, bits 5-3, are the priority bits for normal (non-dual) playfields. Table 7-2: Priority of Playfields Based on Values of Bits PF1P2-PF1P0 Value Placement ----- --------- (from most important to least important) 000 PF1 SP01 SP23 SP45 SP67 001 SP01 PF1 SP23 SP45 SP67 010 SP01 SP23 PF1 SP45 SP67 011 SP01 SP23 SP45 PF1 SP67 100 SP01 SP23 SP45 SP67 PF1 In this table, PF1 stands for playfield 1, and SP01 stands for the group of sprites numbered 0 and 1. SP23 stands for sprites 2 and 3 as a group; SP45 stands for sprites 4 and 5 as a group; and SP67 stands for sprites 6 and 7 as a group. Bits PF2P2-PF2P0 let you position playfield 2 among the sprite priorities in exactly the same way. However, it is the PF2PRI bit that determines which of the two playfields appears in front of the other on the screen. Here is a sample of possible BPLCON2 register contents that would create something a little unusual: BITS 15-7 PF2PRI PF2P2-0 PF1P2-0 VALUE 0s 1 010 000 This will result in a sprite/playfield priority placement of: PF1 SP01 SP23 PF2 SP45 SP67 In other words, where objects pass across each other, playfield 1 is in front of sprite 0 or 1; and sprites 0 through 3 are in front of playfield 2. However, playfield 2 is in front of playfield 1 in any area where they overlap and where playfield 2 is not blocked by sprites 0 through 3. Figure 7-3 shows one use of sprite/playfield priority. The single sprite object shown on the diagram is sprite 0. The sprite can "fly" across playfield 2, but when it crosses playfield 1 the sprite disappears behind that playfield. The result is an unusual video effect that causes the object to disappear when it crosses an invisible boundary on the screen. +---------------------+ +---------------------+ |#####################| | | |#####################| | | |#####################| | ········· | |#####################| | ········· | |#### | |·····················| __ |#### | |·····················| / \ |#### | |·····················| __/____\__ |#### | |·····················| | | |#### | |·····················| |__________| |#### | |·····················| \ / |#### | |·····················| \__/ |#### | |·····················| |#####################| | ········· | Sprite 0 |#####################| | ········· | |#####################| | | |#####################| | | +---------------------+ +---------------------+ Playfield 1 Playfield 2 +---------------------+ |#####################| |#####################| |######·········######| |######·-·-·-·-·######|- - - - - |···|·__··············| |····/ \·············| When everything is displayed together. |···|____\__··········| sprite 0 is more important than playfield 2 |···· |·········| but less important than playfield 1. |···|____ __|·········| So even though you can't see the boundary, |···· /············| the sprite disappears "behind" the |···|\__/·············| invisible PF1 boundary. |·····················| |######·-·-·-·-·######|- - - - - |######·········######| |#####################| |#####################| +---------------------+ Figure 7-3: Sprite/Playfield Priority [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
