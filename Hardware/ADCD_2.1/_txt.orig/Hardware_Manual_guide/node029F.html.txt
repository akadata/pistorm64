K / / Signal Description / System Control Signals ]" border=0> The signals in this group are available for various types of system control; most of these have an immediate or near immediate effect on expansion cards and/or the system CPU itself. Bus Error (/BERR) This is a general indicator of a bus fault condition. Any expansion card capable of detecting a hardware error relating directly to that card can assert /BERR when that bus error condition is detected, especially any sort of harmful hardware error condition. This signal is the strongest possible indicator of a bad situation, as it causes all PICs to get off the bus, and will usually generate a level 2 exception on the host CPU. For any condition that can be handled in software and doesn't pose an immediate threat to hardware, notification via a standard processor interrupt is the better choice. The bus controller will drive /BERR in the event of a detected bus collision or DMA error (an attempt by a bus master to access local bus resources it doesn't have valid access permission for). All cards must monitor /BERR and be prepared to tri-state all of their on-bus output buffers whenever this signal is asserted. The current bus master should, if possible, retry the bus cycle after /BERR is negated unless conditions warrant otherwise. Since any number of devices may assert /BERR, and all bus cards must monitor it, any device that drives /BERR must drive with an open collector or similar device capable of sinking at least 12ma, and any device that monitors /BERR should place a minimal load on it (1 "F" type load or less). This signal is pulled high by a passive backplane resistor. System Reset (/RST, /BUSRST) := ( /RESET, /IORST ) for Zorro III The bus supplies two versions of the system reset signal. The /RST signal is bidirectional and unbuffered, allowing an expansion card to hard reset the system. It should only be used by boards that need this reset capability, and is driven only by an open collector or similar device. The /BUSRST signal is a buffered output-only version of the reset signal that should be used as the normal reset input to boards not concerned with resetting the system on their own. All expansion devices are required to reset their autoconfiguration logic when /BUSRST is asserted. This signal is pulled high by a passive backplane resistor. System Halt (/HLT) This signal is similar to the 68000 processor halt signal, and is driven by a PIC with an open-collector or similar gate only. Its main use is to indicate a full-system reset. Based on the 68000 conventions, an I/O-only reset, such as initiated by the 680x0 RESET instruction, will drive only /RST and /BUSRST on the bus. A full-system reset, such as a powerup reset or a keyboard reset, drives /HLT low as well. PICs that wish to reset the system CPU as well as the bus and I/O devices drive /RST and /HLT, some bus devices such as processor cards may internally reset only on full-system resets. This signal is pulled high by a passive backplane resistor. System Interrupts Six of the decoded, level sensitive 680x0 interrupt inputs were originally available on the expansion bus, and these are labelled as /INT2, /INT6, /EINT1, /EINT4, /EINT5, /EINT7 on the Zorro II bus. Only the /INT2 and /INT6 interrupt inputs are actually supported by Amiga, Inc. as part of the Zorro II specification; the A2000 hardware did not provide the software with the required support mechanisms for the safe use of these lines. Each of these interrupt lines are shared by wired ORing, thus each line must be driven by an open-collector or equivalent output type, and all are pulled high by passive backplane resistors.
