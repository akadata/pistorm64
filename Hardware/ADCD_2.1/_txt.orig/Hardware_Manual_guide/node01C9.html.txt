Glossary / bus starvation ]" border=0> When a master can't get access to the bus, it is said to be starved. On the Zorro II bus, two busy masters can completely starve a third master. Complete starvation is impossible on the Zorro III bus, though a bus hogging Zorro II card can cause similar symptoms. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
