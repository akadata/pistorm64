A Register Summary / BPL1MOD, BPL2MOD ]" border=0> Agnus/ Read/ Denise/ Register Address Write Paula Function -------- ------- ----- ------- -------- BPL1MOD 108 W A Bitplane modulo (odd planes) BPL2MOD 10A W A Bitplane modulo (even planes) These registers contain the modulos for the odd and even bitplanes. A modulo is a number that is automatically added to the address at the end of each line, so that the address then points to the start of the next line. Since they have separate modulos, the odd and even bitplanes may have sizes that are different from each other, as well as different from the display window size. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
