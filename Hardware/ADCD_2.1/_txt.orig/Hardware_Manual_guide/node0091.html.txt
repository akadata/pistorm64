3 / Advanced Topics / Using an External Video Source ]" border=0> External and internal genlocks are available for the Amiga as an option. A genlock allows you to bring in your graphics display from an external video source (such as a VCR, camera, or laser disk player). When you use genlock, the background color is replaced by the display from this external video source. For more information, see the instructions furnished with your genlock.
