K Zorro Expansion Bus / Zorro III Bus Architecture ]" border=0> While the Zorro II bus design was based in large part on an already existing bus cycle, the 68000 cycle, the Zorro III bus design had a much different set of preconditions. It is not modeled after any particular CPU specific bus protocol, but instead it's a logical outgrowth of both the need to support Zorro II cards on the same bus and the need to achieve various modern feature and preformance goals. These goals were summarized in the Zorro Expansion Bus Introduction , now they'll be covered in greater detail here.
