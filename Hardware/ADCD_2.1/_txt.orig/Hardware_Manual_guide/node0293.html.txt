K / / Changes from A2000 Bus / Bus Memory Mapping and Cache Support ]" border=0> Another change to the Zorro II implementation is that the bus mapping logic works a little differently. Zorro II address space is broken up into memory and I/O address space. Memory space is the standard 8 megabyte space from $00200000-$009FFFFF. The I/O address space is mapped at $00E80000-$00EFFFFF, and a new 1.5 megabyte section (previously reserved for motherboard devices) from $00A00000-$00B7FFFF. Zorro II cycles are not generated for non-Zorro II address space, even for 68000 space resources on the local bus. So, for example, a CPU access to chip memory would be visible to a Zorro II PIC in an A2000 backplane, but invisible to that same PIC in an A3000 backplane. Since this extra information on the Zorro II backplane can't be legally used by any PIC anyway, it should not be used by any existing A2000 PICs. The reason for the two distinct mapping regions is for cache support of Zorro II PICs. All access by the local bus* master to Zorro II memory space results in the local bus cache enable signal being driven and a full port read (e.g., both bytes) regardless of the actual data transfer size being requested. A local bus access to Zorro II I/O space results in the local bus cache disable signal being driven and the data strobes for reads indicating the requested transfer size. This cache mapping mechanism was first implemented in the A2630 coprocessor card, so it's not an entirely new concept. * The local bus, motherboard bus, and CPU bus are the same thing; the immediate 680x0 bus connected directly to the CPU in an Amiga computer. Current Amiga computers typically support three distinct buses; the expansion bus, local bus, and chip bus. From the point of view of the expansion bus, the local and chip buses appear as a unified device which may be master or slave to the expansion bus. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
