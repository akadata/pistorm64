3 Playfield Hardware / Forming a Basic Playfield ]" border=0> To get you started, this section describes how to directly access hardware registers to form a single basic playfield that is the same size as the video screen. Here, "same size" means that the playfield is the same size as the actual display window. This will leave a small border between the playfield and the edge of the video screen. The playfield usually does not extend all the way to the edge of the physical display. To form a playfield, you need to define these characteristics: * Height and width of the playfield and size of the display window (that is, how much of the playfield actually appears on the screen). * Color of each pixel in the playfield. * Horizontal resolution. * Vertical resolution, or interlacing. * Data fetch and modulo, which tell the system how much data to put on a horizontal line and how to fetch data from memory to the screen. In addition, you need to allocate memory to store the playfield, set pointers to tell the system where to find the data in memory, and (optionally) write a Copper routine to handle redisplay of the playfield.
