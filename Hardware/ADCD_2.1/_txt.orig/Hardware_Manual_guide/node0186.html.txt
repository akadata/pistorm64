8 / / Reading Controllers / Interpreting Controller Position ]" border=0> Interpreting the position of the proportional controller normally requires some preliminary work during the vertical blanking interval. During vertical blanking , you write a value into an address called POTGO . For a standard X-Y joystick, this value is hex 0001. Writing to this register starts the operation of some special hardware that reads the potentiometer values and sets the values contained in the POT registers (described below) to zero. The read circuitry stays in a reset state for the first seven or eight horizontal video scan lines. Following the reset interval, the circuit allows a charge to begin building up on a timing capacitor whose charge rate will be controlled by the position of the external controller resistance. For each horizontal scan line thereafter, the circuit compares the charge on the timing capacitor to a preset value. If the charge is below the preset, the POT counter is incremented. If the charge is above the preset, the counter value will be held until the next POTGO is issued. Figure 8-5: Effects of Resistance on Charging Rate You normally issue POTGO at the beginning of a video screen, then read the values in the POT registers during the next vertical blanking period, just before issuing POTGO again. Nothing in the system prevents the counters from overflowing (wrapping past a count of 255). However, the system is designed to insure that the counter cannot overflow within the span of a single screen. This allows you to know for certain whether an overflow is indicated by the controller.
