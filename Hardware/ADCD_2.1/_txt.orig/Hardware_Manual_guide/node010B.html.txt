E / / Game Controller Interface Specification / Digital Joysticks ]" border=0> A joystick is a device with four normally opened switches arranged 90 degrees apart. The JOY[0/1]DAT registers become encoded switch input ports as follows: Forward: bit#9 xor bit#8 Left: bit#9 Back: bit#1 xor bit#0 Right: bit#1 Data is encoded to facilitate the mouse/trackball operating mode. NOTE: ----- The right and left direction inputs are also designed to be right and left buttons, respectively, for use with proportional inputs. In this case, the forward and back inputs are not used, while right and left become button inputs rather than joystick inputs. The JOY[0/1]DAT registers are always valid and may be read at any time.
