K / General / Intended Audience ]" border=0> This appendix was written primarily for hardware engineers interested in designing Plug-In Cards for the Zorro III expansion bus. While it may occasionally be of use to software engineers interfacing to such Zorro III PICs, Amiga system software provides an interface layer (expansion.library in the Amiga OS) which manages the needs of most card-level software. A reasonable level of microcomputer knowledge is prerequisite to get much meaning out of these pages. A good understanding of the Motorola 680x0 processors will be quite useful, as will be an understanding of the Zorro II expansion bus used on earlier Amiga computers such as the Amiga 2000.
