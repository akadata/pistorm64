The letters on the tops of these keys are different for each country; not all countries use the QWERTY key layout. These keycodes are best described positionally as shown in Figure 8-10 and Figure 8-11. The international keyboards have two more keys that are "cut out" of larger keys on the USA version. These are $30, cut out from the the left shift, and $2B, cut out from the return key. Figure 8-10: The Amiga 1000 Keyboard Figure 8-11: The Amiga 500/2000/3000 Keyboard [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
