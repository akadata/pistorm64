A Register Summary / AUDxDAT ]" border=0> Agnus/ Read/ Denise/ Register Address Write Paula Function -------- ------- ----- ------- -------- AUDxDAT 0AA W P Audio channel x data This register is the audio channel x (x=0,1,2,3) DMA data buffer. It contains 2 bytes of data that are each 2's complement and are outputted sequentially (with digital-to-analog conversion) to the audio output pins. (LSB = 3 MV) The DMA controller automatically transfers data to this register from RAM. The processor can also write directly to this register. When the DMA data is finished (words outputted=length) and the data in this register has been used, an audio channel interrupt request is set. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
