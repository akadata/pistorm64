K / / Advanced Mode Support Logic / Cache Support ]" border=0> The other advanced cycle modifier on the Zorro III bus is the cache inhibit line, /CINH . On the Zorro II bus, there was originally no caching envisioned, and therefore no real support for caching of Zorro II PICs. First in the A2630 and later in the Zorro III bus' emulation of Zorro II, conventions were adopted to permit caching of Zorro II cards. These conventions aren't perfect; MMU tables will sometimes have to supplant this geographic mapping. While Zorro III doesn't have any cache consistency mechanisms for managing caches between several caching bus masters, it does allow cards that absolutely must not be cached to assert a cache inhibit line, /CINH , on a per-cycle basis (asserted at slave time by a responding slave). This cache management is basically the lowest level of a cache management system, mainly useful for support of I/O and other devices that shouldn't be cached. Software will be required for the higher levels of cache management. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
