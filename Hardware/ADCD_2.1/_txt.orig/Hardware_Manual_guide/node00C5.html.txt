4 Sprite Hardware / Overlapped Sprites ]" border=0> For more complex or larger moving objects, you can overlap sprites. Overlapping simply means that the sprites have the same or relatively close screen positions. A relatively close screen position can result in an object that is wider than 16 pixels. The built-in sprite video priority ensures that one sprite appears to be behind the other when sprites are overlapped. The priority circuitry gives the lowest-numbered sprite the highest priority and the highest numbered sprite the lowest priority. Therefore, when designing displays with overlapped sprites, make sure the "foreground" sprite has a lower number than the "background" sprite. In Figure 4-11, for example, the cage should be generated by a lower-numbered sprite DMA channel than the monkey. Figure 4-11: Overlapping Sprites (Not Attached) You can create a wider sprite display by placing two sprites next to each other. For instance, Figure 4-12 shows the spaceship sprite and how it can be made twice as large by using two sprites placed next to each other.
