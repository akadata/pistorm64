3 / / How to Fetch and Display Data / Modulo in Interlaced Mode ]" border=0> For interlaced mode, you must redefine the modulo, because interlaced mode uses two separate scannings of the video screen for a single display of the playfield. During the first scanning, the odd-numbered lines are fetched to the screen; and during the second scanning, the even-numbered lines are fetched. The bitplanes for a full-screen-sized, interlaced display are 400 NTSC (512 PAL), rather than 200 NTSC (256 PAL), lines long. Assuming that the playfield in memory is the normal 320 pixels wide, data for the interlaced picture begins at the following locations (these are all byte addresses): Line 1 START Line 2 START+40 Line 3 START+80 Line 4 START+120 and so on. Therefore, you use a modulo of 40 to skip the lines in the other field. For odd fields, the bitplane pointers begin at START. For even fields, the bitplane pointers begin at START+40. You can use the Copper to handle resetting of the bitplane pointers for interlaced displays. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
