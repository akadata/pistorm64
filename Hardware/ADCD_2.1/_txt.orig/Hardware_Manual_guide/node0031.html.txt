A Register Summary / DSKDAT, DSKDATR ]" border=0> Agnus/ Read/ Denise/ Register Address Write Paula Function -------- ------- ----- ------- -------- DSKDAT 026 W P Disk DMA data write DSKDATR 008 ER P Disk DMA data read (early read dummy address) This register is the disk DMA data buffer. It contains two bytes of data that are either sent (written) to or received (read) from the disk. The write mode is enabled by bit 14 of the LENGTH register. The DMA controller automatically transfers data to or from this register and RAM, and when the DMA data is finished (length=0) it causes a disk block interrupt. See interrupts below.
