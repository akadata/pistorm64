3 / Forming a Dual-playfield Display / Dual Playfield Summary ]" border=0> The steps for defining dual playfields are almost the same as those for defining the basic playfield. Only in the following steps does the dual-playfield creation process differ from that used for the basic playfield: * Loading colors into the registers . ----------------------------------- Keep in mind that color registers 0-7 are used by playfield 1 and registers 8 through 15 are used by playfield 2 (if there are three bitplanes in each playfield). * Building bitplanes . -------------------- Recall that playfield 1 is formed from PLANES 1, 3, and 5 and playfield 2 from PLANES 2, 4, and 6. * Setting the modulo registers . ------------------------------ Write the modulo to both BPL1MOD and BPL2MOD as you will be using both odd- and even-numbered bitplanes. These steps are added: * Defining priority . ------------------- If you want playfield 2 to have priority, set bit 6 (PF2PRI) in BPLCON2 to 1. * Activating dual-playfield mode . -------------------------------- Set bit 10 ( DBLPF ) in BPLCON0 to 1.
