K / Electrical Specifications / Expansion Bus Loading ]" border=0> The Zorro III bus loading is specified based on typical TTL family "F" series buffer devices, though in reality, compatible CMOS devices are likely to be used in some bus controllers or PICs. Thus, it's important to accept the TTL levels as a minimum voltage level, and make sure that all inputs are the appropriate TTL levels, while outputs can be at TTL or CMOS voltage levels as long as they provide the required source and sink. While some A2000 designs used "LS" or "ALS" buffers instead of "F," the bus will generally work with these older cards, at least with current backplane designs such as the A3000 backplane. However, Zorro III designs must exactly obey these loading rules; it's very probable that some future Zorro III machines will have a large number of slots. In such machines, PICs built on the Zorro II specification will still work in a lightly loaded bus, but may not function in a fully loaded bus. All Zorro III PICs built to spec will work in any Zorro III backplane, without any loading problems, if all loading and timing rules are followed by the PIC designer. The bus signals are divided up into the four groups shown in Table K-2, based on the loading characteristics of the particular signal. The signals in each group are given here. Standard Signals The majority of signals on the bus are in this group. These are bussed signals, driven actively on the bus by F-series (or compatible) drivers such as 74F245, usually tri-stated when ownership of the signal changed for master and slave, and generally terminated with a 220(omega)/330(omega) thevenin terminator. PICs can apply two standard loads to each of these signals when necessary. /FCS /CCS /DS0-/DS3 /LOCK A2-A7 AD8-AD31 SD0-SD7 READ FC0-FC2 DOE /IORST /BCLR /MTCR /MTACK Clock Signals Open Collector Signals Non-bussed Signals [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
