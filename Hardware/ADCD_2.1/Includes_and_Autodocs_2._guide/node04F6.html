TIMER REQUEST
    A time request is a non standard IO Request.  It has an <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0094.html#line19">IORequest</a>
    followed by a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line26">timeval</a> structure or an eclockval structure.

TIMEVAL
    A <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line26">timeval</a> structure consists of two longwords.  The first is
    the number of seconds, the latter is the fractional number
    of microseconds.  The microseconds must always be &#034;normalized&#034;
    e.g. the longword must be between 0 and one million.

ECLOCKVAL
    A eclockval structure consists of two longwords.  The first is
    the high order 32 bits of a 64 bit number and the second is the
    the low order 32 bits.  The 64 bit number is a count of &#034;E&#034; clock
    ticks.  The &#034;E&#034; clock frequency is related to the master clock
    frequency of the machine and can be determined by calling the
    <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node04FB.html">ReadEClock()</a> library like call.

UNITS
    The timer contains five units -- two designed to accuratly measure
    short intervals, one that has little system overhead and is very
    stable over time, and two that work like an alarm clock.

UNIT_MICROHZ
    This unit uses the programmable timers in the 8520s to keep track
    of its time.  It has precision down to about 2 microseconds, but
    will drift as system load increases.  The accuracy of this unit
    is the same as that of the master clock of the machine.  This unit
    uses a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line26">timeval</a> in its <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line36">timerequest</a>.

UNIT_VBLANK
    This unit uses a strobe from the power supply to keep track of its
    time or the &#034;E&#034; clock on machines without power supply strobes.
    It is very stable over time, but only has a resolution of that of
    the vertical blank interrupt.  This unit is very cheap to use, and
    should be used by those who are waiting for long periods of time
    (typically 1/2 second or more).  This unit uses a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line26">timeval</a> in its
    <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line36">timerequest</a>.

UNIT_ECLOCK
    This unit is exacly the same as UNIT_MICROHZ except that it uses
    an eclockval instead of a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line26">timeval</a> in its <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line36">timerequest</a>.

UNIT_WAITUNTIL
    This unit waits until the systime is greater than or equal to the
    time in the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line26">timeval</a> in the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line36">timerequest</a>.  This unit has the same
    resolution and accuracy as that of UNIT_VBLANK.

UNIT_WAITECLOCK
    This unit waits until the E-Clock value as returned by <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node04FB.html">ReadEClock()</a>
    is greater than or equal to the eclockval in the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0053.html#line36">timerequest</a>. This
    unit has the same resolution and accuracy as that of UNIT_ECLOCK.

LIBRARY
    In addition to the normal device calls, the timer also supports
    several direct, library like calls.

BUGS
    In the V1.2/V1.3 release, the timer device has problems with
    very short time requests.  When one of these is made, other
    timer requests may be finished inaccurately.  A side effect
    is that AmigaDOS requests such as &#034;Delay(0);&#034; or
    &#034;WaitForChar(x,0);&#034; are unreliable.
