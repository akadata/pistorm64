NAME
    UnGetC -- Makes a char available for reading again. (buffered) (V36)

SYNOPSIS
    value = UnGetC(fh, character)
    D0             D1      D2

    LONG UnGetC(BPTR, LONG)

FUNCTION
    Pushes the character specified back into the input buffer.  Every
    time you use a buffered read routine, you can always push back 1
    character.  You may be able to push back more, though it is not
    recommended, since there is no guarantee on how many can be
    pushed back at a given moment.

    Passing -1 for the character will cause the last character read to
    be pushed back.  If the last character read was an EOF, the next
    character read will be an EOF.

    Note: UnGetC can be used to make sure that a filehandle is set up
    as a read filehandle.  This is only of importance if you are writing
    a shell, and must manipulate the filehandle's buffer.

INPUTS
    fh        - filehandle to use for buffered I/O
    character - character to push back or -1

RESULT
    value     - character pushed back, or FALSE if the character cannot
                be pushed back.

BUGS
    In V36, UnGetC(fh,-1) after an EOF would not cause the next character
    read to be an EOF.  This was fixed for V37.
