NAME
    ParsePattern -- Create a tokenized string for <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node02CF.html">MatchPattern()</a> (V36)

SYNOPSIS
    IsWild = ParsePattern(Source, Dest, DestLength)
    d0                      D1     D2      D3

    LONG ParsePattern(STRPTR, STRPTR, LONG)

FUNCTION
    Tokenizes a pattern, for use by <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node02CF.html">MatchPattern()</a>.  Also indicates if
    there are any wildcards in the pattern (i.e. whether it might match
    more than one item).  Note that Dest must be at least 2 times as
    large as Source plus bytes to be (almost) 100% certain of no
    buffer overflow.  This is because each input character can currently
    expand to 2 tokens (with one exception that can expand to 3, but
    only once per string).  Note: this implementation may change in
    the future, so you should handle error returns in all cases, but
    the size above should still be a reasonable upper bound for a buffer
    allocation.

    The patterns are fairly extensive, and approximate some of the ability
    of Unix/grep &#034;regular expression&#034; patterns.  Here are the available
    tokens:

    ?       Matches a single character.
    #       Matches the following expression 0 or more times.
    (ab|cd) Matches any one of the items seperated by '|'.
    ~       Negates the following expression.  It matches all strings
            that do not match the expression (aka ~(foo) matches all
            strings that are not exactly &#034;foo&#034;).
    [abc]   Character class: matches any of the characters in the class.
    [~bc]   Character class: matches any of the characters not in the
            class.
    a-z     Character range (only within character classes).
    %       Matches 0 characters always (useful in &#034;(foo|bar|%)&#034;).
    *       Synonym for &#034;#?&#034;, not available by default in 2.0.  Available
            as an option that can be turned on.

    &#034;Expression&#034; in the above table means either a single character
    (ex: &#034;#?&#034;), or an alternation (ex: &#034;#(ab|cd|ef)&#034;), or a character
    class (ex: &#034;#[a-zA-Z]&#034;).

INPUTS
    source     - unparsed wildcard string to search for.
   dest       - output string, gets tokenized version of input.
    DestLength - length available in destination (should be at least as
                 twice as large as source + 2 bytes).

RESULT
    IsWild - 1 means there were wildcards in the pattern,
             0 means there were no wildcards in the pattern,
            -1 means there was a buffer overflow or other error

BUGS
    Should set <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node02C2.html">IoErr()</a> to something useful (not currently set) on an
    error.
