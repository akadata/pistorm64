NAME
    Disable -- disable interrupt processing.

SYNOPSIS
    Disable();

    void Disable(void);

FUNCTION
    Prevents interrupts from being handled by the system, until a
    matching <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node034C.html">Enable()</a> is executed.  Disable() implies <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0353.html">Forbid()</a>.

    DO NOT USE THIS CALL WITHOUT GOOD JUSTIFICATION.  THIS CALL IS
    VERY DANGEROUS!

RESULTS
    All interrupt processing is deferred until the task executing makes
    a call to <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node034C.html">Enable()</a> or is placed in a wait state.  Normal task
    rescheduling does not occur while interrupts are disabled.  In order
    to restore normal interrupt processing, the programmer must execute
    exactly one call to <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node034C.html">Enable()</a> for every call to Disable().

    IMPORTANT REMINDER:

    It is important to remember that there is a danger in using
    disabled sections.  Disabling interrupts for more than ~250
    microseconds will prevent vital system functions (especially serial
    I/0) from operating in a normal fashion.

    Think twice before using Disable(), then think once more.
    After all that, think again.  With enough thought, the need
    for a Disable() can often be eliminated.  For the user of many
    device drivers, a write to disable *only* the particular interrupt
    of interest can replace a Disable().  For example:
                    MOVE.W  #INTF_PORTS,_intena
    Do not use a macro for Disable(), insist on the real thing.

    This call may be made from interrupts, it will have the effect
    of locking out all higher-level interrupts (lower-level interrupts
    are automatically disabled by the CPU).

    Note: In the event of a task entering a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node038A.html">Wait()</a> after disabling
          interrupts, the system &#034;breaks&#034; the disabled state and runs
          normally until the task which called Disable() is rescheduled.

NOTE
    This call is guaranteed to preserve all registers.
