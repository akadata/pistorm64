    NAME
	AllocMiscResource - allocate one of the miscelaneous resources

   SYNOPSIS
	CurrentUser = AllocMiscResource( unitNum, name )
	D0				 D0	  A1

	char * AllocMiscResource(ULONG,char *);

   FUNCTION
	This routine attempts to allocate one of the miscellaneous resources
	If the resource had already been allocated, an error is returned. If
	you do get it, your name is associated with the resource (so a user
	can see who has it allocated).

	This function may not be called from interrupt code

   DESCRIPTION
	There are certain parts of the hardware that a multitasking- friendly
	program may need to take over.	The serial port is a good example. By
	grabbing the misc.resource for the serial port, the caller would
	&#034;own&#034; the hardware registers associated with that function.  Nobody
	else, including the system serial driver, is allowed to interfere.

	Resources are called in exactly the same manner as libraries.
	From assembly language, A6 must equal the resource base.  The
	offsets for the function are listed in the resources/misc.i
	include file (MR_ALLOCMISCRESOURCE for this function).

   INPUTS
	unitNum - the number of the resource you want to allocate
		  (eg.  MR_SERIALBITS).
	name - a mnenonic name that will help the user figure out
		what piece of software is hogging a resource.
		(havoc breaks out if a name of null is passed in...)

   RESULTS
	CurrentUser - if the resource is busy, then the name of
		the current user is returned.  If the resource is
		free, then null is returned.

   NAME
	FreeMiscResource - make a resource available for reallocation

   SYNOPSIS
	FreeMiscResource( unitNum )
			  D0

	void FreeMiscResource(ULONG);

   FUNCTION
	This routine frees one of the resources allocated
	by AllocMiscResource.  The resource is made available
	for reuse.

	FreeMiscResource must be called from the same task that
	called AllocMiscResource.  This function may not be called from
	interrupt code.

    INPUTS
	unitNum - the number of the miscellaneous resource to be freed.

    RESULTS
	Frees the appropriate resource.

    BUGS
