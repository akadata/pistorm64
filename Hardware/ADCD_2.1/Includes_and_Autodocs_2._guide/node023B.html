NAME
    OpenWorkBench -- Open the Workbench screen.

SYNOPSIS
    WBScreen = OpenWorkBench()
    D0

    ULONG OpenWorkBench( VOID );

FUNCTION
    This routine attempts to reopen the Workbench.  The actions taken are:
        - general good stuff and nice things, and then return a non-null
          pointer to the Workbench screen.
        - find that something has gone wrong, and return NULL

    The return value, if not NULL, is indeed the address of the Workbench
    screen, although you should not use it as such.  This is because the
    Workbench may be closed by other programs, which can invalidate
    the address at any time.  We suggest that you regard the return
    value as a ULONG indication that the routine has succeeded, if
    you pay any attention to it at all.

INPUTS
    None

RESULT
    non-zero if Workbench screen opened successfully, or was already
            opened
    zero if anything went wrong and the Workbench screen isn't out there

BUGS
    The name of this routine is spelled wrong: it ought to have been
    OpenWorkbench().
