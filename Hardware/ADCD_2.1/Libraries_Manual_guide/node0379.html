Simple Sprites can be used to create animations, so even though are not
really part of the GELs system, they are desribed here as a possible
alternative to using VSprites.  For more information on the sprite
hardware, including information on attached sprites, see the Amiga
<a name="line6"><a href="../Hardware_Manual_guide/node00AE.html">Hardware</a> Reference Manual.</a>

The SimpleSprite structure is found in &#060;graphics/<a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node00C5.html#line20">sprite.h</a>&#062;. It has fields
that indicate the height and position of the Simple Sprite and a number
that indicates which of the 8 hardware sprites to use.

Simple Sprites are always 16 bits wide, which is why there is no width
member in the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node00C5.html#line20">SimpleSprite</a> structure.  Currently, sprites always appear as
low-resolution pixels, and their position is specified in the same way.
If the sprite is being moved across a high-resolution display in single
pixel increments, it will appear to move two high-resolution pixels for
each increment.  In low-resolution mode, a single Lores pixel movement
will be seen.  Similarly, in an interlaced display, the y direction
motions are in two-line increments. The same sprite image data is placed
into both even and odd fields of the interlaced display, so the sprite
<a name="line21">will appear to be the same size in any display mode.</a>

The upper left corner of the <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node00F1.html#line4">ViewPort</a> area has coordinates (0,0). Unlike
VSprites, the motion of a Simple Sprite can be relative to this position.
(That is, if you create a Simple Sprite relative to your ViewPort and move
the ViewPort around, the Simple Sprite can move as well, but its movement
<a name="line27">is relative to the origin of the ViewPort.)</a>

The Sprite pairs 0/1, 2/3, 4/5, and 6/7 share color registers.  See
&#034;<a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node0391.html">VSprite Advanced Topics</a>&#034; later in this chapter, for precautions to take
<a name="line31">if Simple Sprites and VSprites are used at the same time.</a>

The following figure shows which color registers are used by Simple
Sprites.

                 Figure 28-2: Sprite Color Registers


Sprites do not have exclusive use of the color registers. If the <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node00F1.html#line4">ViewPort</a>
is 5 bitplanes deep, all 32 of the system color registers will still be
used by the playfield display hardware.

    Note:
    -----
    Color zero for all Sprites is always a &#034;transparent&#034; color, and the
    colors in registers 16, 20, 24, and 28 are not used by sprites. These
    colors will be seen only if they are rendered into a playfield. For
<a name="line71">    further information, see the Amiga <a href="../Hardware_Manual_guide/node00B7.html">Hardware</a> Reference Manual.</a>

If there are two <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node00F1.html#line4">ViewPort</a>s with different color sets on the same display,
a sprite will switch colors when it is moved across their boundary.  For
example, Sprite 0 and 1 will appear in colors 17-19 of whatever ViewPort
they happen to be over.  This is because the system jams all the
ViewPort's colors into the display hardware at the top of each ViewPort.
