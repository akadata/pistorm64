For the most part, the examples in this book are written in C (there are a
few 68000 assembly language examples too).

C examples have been compiled under SAS C, version 5.10a.  The compiler
options used with each example are noted in the comments preceding the
<a name="line7">code.</a>

In general, the examples are also compatible with Manx Aztec C 68K,
version 5.0d, and other C compilers, however some changes will usually be
necessary.  Specifically, all the C examples assume that the automatic
Ctrl-C feature of the compiler has been disabled.  For SAS C (and Lattice
C revisions 4.0 and greater) this is handled with:


    /* Add this before main() to override the default Ctrl-C handling
     * provided in SAS (Lattice) C.  Ctrl-C event will be ignored */

    int CXBRK ( void )   { return(0); }
    int chkabort( void ) { return(0); }

For Manx Aztec C, replace the above with:

    /* Add this near the top */
            #include &#060;functions.h&#062;

    /* Add this before main() */
            extern int Enable_Abort;   /* reference abort enable */

    /* Add this after main(), as the first active line in the program */
            Enable_Abort=0;         /* turn off CTRL-C */
<a name="line32"></a>

Other changes may be required depending on the example and the C compiler
you are using.  Most of the C examples in this book use the following
special option flags of the SAS/C compiler (set the equivalent option of
whatever compiler you are using):


-b1 = Small data model.
-cf = Check for function prototypes.
  i = Ignore #include statements that are identical to one already given.
  s = Store all literal strings that are identical in the same place.
  t = Enable warnings for structures that are used before they are defined.

 -v = Do not include stack checking code with each function.
 -y = Load register A4 with the data section base address on function
      entry.  The -v and -y flags are are generally only needed for parts
      of the program that are called directly by the system such as
      <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node030B.html">interrupt servers</a>, <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node02C0.html#line29">subtasks</a>, <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node0309.html">handlers</a> and <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node04A2.html">callback hook</a> functions.


Except where noted, each example was linked with the standard SAS/C
startup code c.o, the SAS/C linker library lc.lib and the Amiga linker
library amiga.lib.  The SAS/C compiler defaults to 32-bit ints.  If your
development environment uses 16-bit ints you may need to explicitly cast
certain arguments as longs (for example 1L &#060;&#060; sigbit instead of 1 &#060;&#060;
sigbit).

The 68000 assembly language examples have been assembled under the
Innovatronics CAPE assembler V2.x, the HiSoft Devpac assembler V1.2, and
<a name="line62">the Lake Forest Logic ADAPT assembler 1.0.  No substantial changes should</a>
be required to switch between assemblers.
