** Function to calculate the Body and Pot values of a proportional gadget
** given the three values total, displayable, and top, representing the
** total number of items in a list, the number of items displayable at one
** time, and the top item to be displayed.  For example, a file requester
** may be able to display 10 entries at a time.  The directory has 20
** entries in it, and the top one displayed is number 3 (the fourth one,
** counting from zero), then total = 20, displayable = 10, and top = 3.
**
** Note that this routine assumes that the displayable variable is greater
** than the overlap variable.
**
** A final value, overlap, is used to determine the number of lines of
** &#034;overlap&#034; between pages.  This is the number of lines displayed from the
** previous page when jumping to the next page.

** lines - overlap) / (the total number of lines - overlap).
