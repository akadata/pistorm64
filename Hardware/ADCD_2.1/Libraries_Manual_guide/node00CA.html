Intuition solves the problem of interacting with multiple programs by
dividing the display up into <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node00D9.html">multiple screens</a> and overlapping <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node00FF.html">windows</a> so
that each application has its own work area.  The user sees the Amiga
environment through these windows, each of which can represent a different
task or application context.

<a name="line8">     <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node05CA.html">Figure 2-1: The Workbench Screen With Windows</a> </a>

The user performs operations inside screens and windows with the <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node01E5.html">mouse</a>, a
mechanical device that moves a <a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node01EB.html">pointer</a> over the Amiga's display.  The user
moves the mouse to position the pointer on graphic symbols of various
objects or actions.  Buttons on the mouse are pressed to select or
activate the item pointed to.

The user can switch back and forth between different jobs, such as writing
a document, drawing an illustration, printing text, or getting help from
the system simply by moving from one window to another with the mouse.
With the mouse, the user can also change the shape and size of application
<a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node0100.html">windows</a>, move them around on the screen, overlap them, bring a window to
the foreground, and send a window to the background.  By changing the
arrangement of the windows, the user selects which information is visible
and which application to work with next.  (<a href="../Libraries_Manual_guide/node00DB.html">Screens</a> may also be moved up or
down in the display, and they can be moved in front of or behind other
screens.)
