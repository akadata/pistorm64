graphics.library/LoadView ]" border=0> NAME LoadView -- Use a (possibly freshly created) coprocessor instruction list to create the current display. SYNOPSIS LoadView( View ) A1 void LoadView( struct View * ); FUNCTION Install a new view to be displayed during the next display refresh pass. Coprocessor instruction list has been created by InitVPort() , MakeVPort() , and MrgCop() . INPUTS View - a pointer to the View structure which contains the pointer to the constructed coprocessor instructions list, or NULL. RESULT If the View pointer is non-NULL, the new View is displayed, according to your instructions. The vertical blank routine will pick this pointer up and direct the copper to start displaying this View . If the View pointer is NULL, no View is displayed. NOTE Even though a LoadView(NULL) is performed, display DMA will still be active. Sprites will continue to be displayed after a LoadView(NULL) unless an OFF_SPRITE is subsequently performed.
