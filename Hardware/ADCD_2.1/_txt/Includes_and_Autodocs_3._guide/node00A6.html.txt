cd.device/CD_CONFIG ]" border=0> NAME CD_CONFIG -- Set drive preferences IO REQUEST io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command CD_CONFIG io_Data pointer to first entry of TagList io_Length 0 RESULTS io_Error 0 for success, or an error code as defined in FUNCTION This command sets one or more of the configuration items. The configuration items are: TAGCD_PLAYSPEED Default: 75 TAGCD_READSPEED Default: 75 (do not count on this) TAGCD_READXLSPEED Default: 75 TAGCD_SECTORSIZE Default: 2048 TAGCD_XLECC Default: 1 (on) TAGCD_EJECTRESET Default: can be 0 (off) or 1 (on) The speed settings are described in the number of frames (sectors) per second. All CD-ROM drives are capable of the 75 frames/second rate. Some drives are capable of 150 frames/second, and some even more. To determine the maximum frame rate of the drive, use the CD_INFO command. Valid values for caddyless Commodore CD-ROM drives are 75 and 150 (normal speed and double speed). All other values are invalid. You should always make sure the drive is capable of the configuration you are requesting by either using the CD_INFO command, and/or by checking for an error condition after submitting your request. There are three different types of CD-ROM sectors. Mode 1 sectors (2048 bytes), mode 2 form 1 sectors (2048 bytes), and mode 2 form 2 sectors (2328 bytes). Normally, disks are encoded in Mode 1 format. Mode 2 form 1 is basically the same as mode 1; however, the mode 2 form 2 sector format contains no CD-ROM error correction information. In order to read information encoded in this sector format, the drive's sector size must be configured to 2328 byte sectors. Error correction (ECC) of the READXL command can be turned off or on with this command. Error correction can be implemented in either hardware or software (depending on the CD-ROM drive). When ECC is implemented in software, CPU usage can become bursty. Errors rarely occur on CDs unless they have numerous scratches, but when they do occur, they will cause a loss of CPU bandwith. When ECC is implemented in hardware, no CPU bandwidth is lost -- in this case, ECC will always be on no matter how you configure the drive because it is free. The READXL command is used primarily for displaying movie-like data. In this case, speed is essential and data integrety is not; however, if the CPU is not being utilized during an XL animation there is no need to disable ECC (since the bandwidth is there to be used). The only time ECC should be disabled is when you are doing intense calculations in the background of a READXL command, AND your program is time-critical. Do not forget to change this back when you are done! To make the computer reset when a CD is ejected (for an application that does not exit), use the TAGCD_EJECTRESET tag. When possible, titles should be able to exit cleanly back to Workbench. Error conditions should be monitored when doing disk I/O. EXAMPLE /* Configure ReadXL for double-speed reading and turn off ECC when */ /* the ReadXL command is used. */ struct TagItem ConfigList[] = { { TAGCD_READXLSPEED, 150 }, { TAGCD_XLECC, 0 }, { TAG_END, 0 } }; ior->io_Command = CD_CONFIG; ior->io_Data = (APTR)&ConfigList; ior->io_Length = 0; DoIO(ior); if (ior->io_Error) printf("Could not be configuredn"); NOTES Setting the configuration will not modify the behavior of a read or play command already in progress. This can be a very dangerous command. If for instance you set TAGCD_SECTORSIZE to 2328, you will no longer be able to read any data encoded at 2048 byte sectors (e.g. the file system will not be able to read the disk anymore). After you read any data stored with this sector format, you should immediately configure back to the original default value (even if the read failed -- the disk could be removed in the middle of your read). You should NEVER use this command if you are not the exclusive owner of your disk. BUGS TAG_IGNORE, TAG_MORE, and TAG_SKIP do not work. Do not use these. When switching speeds from single to double (or double to single), If the drive is prefetching in single-speed the data you are going to use in double-speed, the drive will not switch to double-speed (and visa versa). To avoid this problem, switch to the desired speed, begin reading at least 4k into the data (just read two bytes), then begin reading at the beginning. This will force the prefetch buffer to clear and issue a new read command with the desired speed. (Fixed in 40.24). SEE ALSO CD_INFO , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
