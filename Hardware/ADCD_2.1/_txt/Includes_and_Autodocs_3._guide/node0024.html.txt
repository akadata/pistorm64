amiga.lib/CallHook ]" border=0> NAME CallHook -- Invoke a hook given a message on the stack. SYNOPSIS result = CallHook( hookPtr, obj, ... ) ULONG CallHook( struct Hook *, Object *, ... ); FUNCTION Like CallHookA() , CallHook() invoke a hook on the supplied hook-specific data (an "object") and a parameter packet ("message"). However, CallHook() allows you to build the message on your stack. INPUTS hookPtr - A system-standard hook obj - hook-specific data object ... - The hook-specific message you wish to send. The hook is expecting a pointer to the message, so a pointer into your stack will be sent. RESULT result - a hook-specific result. NOTES This function first appeared in the V37 release of amiga.lib. However, it does not depend on any particular version of the OS, and works fine even in V34. EXAMPLE If your hook's message was struct myMessage { ULONG mm_FirstGuy; ULONG mm_SecondGuy; ULONG mm_ThirdGuy; }; You could write: result = CallHook( hook, obj, firstguy, secondguy, thirdguy ); as a shorthand for: struct myMessage msg; msg.mm_FirstGuy = firstguy; msg.mm_SecondGuy = secondguy; msg.mm_ThirdGuy = thirdguy; result = CallHookA( hook, obj, &msg ); SEE ALSO CallHookA() , utility.library/CallHookPkt() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
