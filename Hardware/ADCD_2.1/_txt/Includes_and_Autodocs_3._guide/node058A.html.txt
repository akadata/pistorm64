trackdisk.device/TD_MOTOR ]" border=0> NAME TD_MOTOR/ETD_MOTOR -- control the on/off state of a drive motor. FUNCTION This command gives control over the disk motor. The motor may be turned on or off. When it is on, the drive light automatically turns on as well. If the motor is just being turned on, the device will delay the proper amount of time to allow the drive to come up to speed. Normally, turning the drive on is not necessary, the device does this automatically if it receives a request when the motor is off. However, turning the motor off is the programmer's responsibility. In addition, the standard instructions to the user are that it is safe to remove a disk from a drive if and only if the motor is off (that is, if the disk light is off). IO REQUEST INPUT io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command TD_MOTOR or ETD_MOTOR io_Flags 0 or IOF_QUICK io_Length the requested state of the motor, 0 to turn the motor off, and 1 to turn the motor on. iotd_Count (ETD_MOTOR only) maximum allowable change counter value. IO REQUEST RESULT io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in io_Actual - if io_Error is 0 this contains the previous state of the drive motor. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
