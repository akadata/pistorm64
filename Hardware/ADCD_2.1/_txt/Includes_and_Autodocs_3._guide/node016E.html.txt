dos.library/FRead ]" border=0> NAME FRead -- Reads a number of blocks from an input (buffered) (V36) SYNOPSIS count = FRead(fh, buf, blocklen, blocks) D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 LONG FRead(BPTR, STRPTR , ULONG, ULONG) FUNCTION Attempts to read a number of blocks, each blocklen long, into the specified buffer from the input stream. May return less than the number of blocks requested, either due to EOF or read errors. This call is buffered. INPUTS fh - filehandle to use for buffered I/O buf - Area to read bytes into. blocklen - number of bytes per block. Must be > 0. blocks - number of blocks to read. Must be > 0. RESULT count - Number of _blocks_ read, or 0 for EOF. On an error, the number of blocks actually read is returned. BUGS Doesn't clear IoErr() before starting. If you want to find out about errors, use SetIoErr(0L) before calling. SEE ALSO FGetC() , FWrite() , FGets() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
