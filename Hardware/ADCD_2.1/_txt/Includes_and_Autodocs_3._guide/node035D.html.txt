(V36) SYNOPSIS error = CollectionChunk(iff, type, id); D0 A0 D0 D1 LONG CollectionChunk(struct IFFHandle *, LONG , LONG); FUNCTION Installs an entry handler for chunks with the given type and id so that the contents of those chunks will be stored as they are encountered. This is like PropChunk() except that more than one chunk of this type can be stored in lists which can be returned by FindCollection() . The storage of these chunks still follows the property chunk scoping rules for IFF files so that at any given point, stored collection chunks will be valid in the current context. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle structure (does not need to be open) type - type code for the chunk to declare (ex. "ILBM") id - identifier for the chunk to declare (ex. "CRNG") RESULT error - 0 if successful or an IFFERR_#? error code if unsuccessful. SEE ALSO CollectionChunks() , FindCollection() , PropChunk() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
