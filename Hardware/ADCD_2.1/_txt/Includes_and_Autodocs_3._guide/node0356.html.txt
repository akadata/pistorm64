icon.library/PutDiskObject ]" border=0> NAME PutDiskObject - write out a DiskObject to disk. SYNOPSIS status = PutDiskObject(name, diskobj) D0 A0 A1 BOOL PutDiskObject(STRPTR, struct DiskObject *); FUNCTION This routine writes out a DiskObject structure, and its associated information. The file name of the info file will be the name parameter with ".info" postpended to it. If the call fails, FALSE will be returned. The reason for the failure may be obtained via IoErr() . As of release V2.0, PutDiskObject() (if successful) notifies Workbench when an icon has been created/modified. Using this routine protects you from any future changes to the way icons are stored within the system. INPUTS name -- name of the object (pointer to a character string) diskobj -- a pointer to a DiskObject RESULTS status -- TRUE if the call succeeded else FALSE NOTES It is recommended that if you wish to copy an icon from one place to another than you use GetDiskObject() and PutDiskObject() and do not copy them directly.
