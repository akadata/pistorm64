amiga.lib/ArgArrayInit ]" border=0> NAME ArgArrayInit -- allocate and initialize a tooltype array. (V36) SYNOPSIS ttypes = ArgArrayInit(argc,argv); UBYTE **ArgArrayInit(LONG, UBYTE **); FUNCTION This function returns a null-terminated array of strings suitable for sending to icon.library/FindToolType() . This array will be the ToolTypes array of the program's icon, if it was started from Workbench. It will just be 'argv' if the program was started from a shell. Pass ArgArrayInit() your startup arguments received by main(). ArgArrayInit() requires that icon.library be open (even if the caller was started from a shell, so that the function FindToolType() can be used) and may call GetDiskObject() , so clean up is necessary when the strings are no longer needed. The function ArgArrayDone() does just that. INPUTS argc - the number of arguments in argv, 0 when started from Workbench argv - an array of pointers to the program's arguments, or the Workbench startup message when started from WB. RESULTS ttypes - the initialized argument array or NULL if it could not be allocated EXAMPLE Use of these routines facilitates the use of ToolTypes or command- line arguments to control end-user parameters in Commodities applications. For example, a filter used to trap a keystroke for popping up a window might be created by something like this: char *ttypes = ArgArrayInit(argc, argv); CxObj *filter = UserFilter(ttypes, "POPWINDOW", "alt f1"); ... with ... CxObj *UserFilter(char **tt, char *action_name, char *default_descr) { char *desc; desc = FindToolType(tt,action_name); return(CxFilter((ULONG)(desc? desc: default_descr))); } In this way the user can assign "alt f2" to the action by entering a tooltype in the program's icon of the form: POPWINDOW=alt f2 or by starting the program from the CLI like so: myprogram "POPWINDOW=alt f2" NOTE Your program must open icon.library and set up IconBase before calling this routine. In addition IconBase must remain valid until after ArgArrayDone() has been called! SEE ALSO ArgArrayDone() , ArgString() , ArgInt() , icon.library/FindToolType() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
