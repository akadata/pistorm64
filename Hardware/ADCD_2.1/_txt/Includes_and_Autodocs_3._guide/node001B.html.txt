This is a one-way encryption. Normally, the user's encrypted password is stored in a file for future password comparison. INPUTS buffer - a pointer to a buffer at least 12 bytes in length. password - a pointer to an unencrypted password string. username - a pointer to the user's name. RESULT newpass - a pointer to the passed buffer if successful, NULL upon failure. The encrypted password placed in the buffer will be be eleven (11) characters in length and will be NULL-terminated. EXAMPLE UBYTE *pw, *getpassword() ; UBYTE *user = "alf" UBYTE *newpass ; UBYTE buffer[16] ; /* size >= 12 */ pw = getpassword() ; /* your own function */ if((newpass = ACrypt(buffer, pw, user)) != NULL) { printf("pw = %sn", newpass) ; /* newpass = &buffer[0] */ } else { printf("ACrypt failedn") ; } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
