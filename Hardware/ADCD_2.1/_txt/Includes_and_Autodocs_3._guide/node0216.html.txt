exec.library/InitResident ]" border=0> NAME InitResident - initialize resident module SYNOPSIS object = InitResident(resident, segList) D0 A1 D1 APTR InitResident(struct Resident *,ULONG); FUNCTION Initialize a ROMTag. ROMTags are used to link system modules together. Each disk based device or library must contain a ROMTag structure in the first code hunk. Once the validity of the ROMTag is verified, the RT_INIT pointer is jumped to with the following registers: D0 = 0 A0 = segList A6 = ExecBase INPUTS resident - Pointer to a ROMTag segList - SegList of the loaded object, if loaded from disk. Libraries & Devices will cache this value for later return at close or expunge time. Pass NULL for ROM modules. RESULTS object - Return value from the init code, usually the library or device base. NULL for failure. AUTOINIT FEATURE An automatic method of library/device base and vector table initialization is also provided by InitResident(). The initial code hunk of the library or device should contain "MOVEQ #-1,d0; RTS;". Following that must be an initialized Resident structure with RTF_AUTOINIT set in rt_Flags, and an rt_Init pointer which points to four longwords. These four longwords will be used in a call to MakeLibrary(); - The size of your library/device base structure including initial Library or Device structure. - A pointer to a longword table of standard, then library specific function offsets, terminated with -1L. (short format offsets are also acceptable) - Pointer to data table in exec/InitStruct format for initialization of Library or Device structure. - Pointer to library initialization function, or NULL. Calling sequence: D0 = library base A0 = segList A6 = ExecBase This function must return in D0 the library/device base to be linked into the library/device list. If the initialization function fails, the device memory must be manually deallocated, then NULL returned in D0. SEE ALSO exec/resident.i, FindResident() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
