parallel.device/CMD_READ ]" border=0> NAME Read -- read input from parallel port FUNCTION This command causes a stream of characters to be read from the parallel I/O register. The number of characters is specified in io_Length. The EOF and EOL modes are supported, but be warned that using these modes can result in a buffer overflow if the proper EOL or EOF character is not received in time. These modes should be used only when the sender and receiver have been designed to cooperate. A safety guard can be implemented to EOF by setting io_Length to a maximum allowed value. That cannot be done with EOL since the EOL mode is identified by io_Length=-1. The parallel.device has no internal buffer; if no read request has been made, pending input (i.e. handshake request) is not acknowledged. IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort initialized io_Device set by OpenDevice io_Unit set by OpenDevice io_Command CMD_READ (02) io_Flags If IOF_QUICK is set, driver will attempt Quick IO io_Length number of characters to receive. io_Data pointer where to put the data. RESULTS io_Error -- if the Read succeded, then io_Error will be null. If the Read failed, then io_Error will contain an error code.
