(V40) SYNOPSIS list = GetNVList(appName, killRequesters); D0 A0 D1 struct MinList *GetNVList(STRPTR, BOOL); FUNCTION Returns a pointer to an Exec list of nonvolatile Items associated with the appName requested. The string appName may not contain the '/' or ':' characters. It is recommended that these characters be blocked from user input when requesting an appName string. INPUTS appName - NULL terminated string indicating the application name to be matched. Maximum length is 31. killRequesters - Suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system requesters are to be suppressed during this function. FALSE if system requesters are allowed. RESULT list - a pointer to an Exec MinList of NVEntries. A NULL will be returned if there is insufficient memory. If there are no entries in the nonvolatile storage for the AppName, an empty list will be returned. NOTE The protection field contains more bits than are required for storing the delete protection status. These bits are reserved for other system usage and may not be zero. When checking for the delete status use either the field mask NVIF_DELETE, or the bit definition NVIB_DELETE. SEE ALSO FreeNVData() , SetNVProtection() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
