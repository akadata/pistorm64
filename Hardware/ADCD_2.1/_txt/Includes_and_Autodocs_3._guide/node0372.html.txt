iffparse.library/ParseIFF ]" border=0> NAME ParseIFF -- parse an IFF file from an IFFHandle structure stream. (V36) SYNOPSIS error = ParseIFF(iff, control); D0 A0 D0 LONG ParseIFF(struct IFFHandle *, LONG); FUNCTION This is the biggie. Traverses a file opened for read by pushing chunks onto the context stack and popping them off directed by the generic syntax of IFF files. As it pushes each new chunk, it searches the context stack for handlers to apply to chunks of that type. If it finds an entry handler it will invoke it just after entering the chunk. If it finds an exit handler it will invoke it just before leaving the chunk. Standard handlers include entry handlers for pre-declared property chunks and collection chunks and entry and exit handlers for for stop chunks - that is, chunks which will cause the ParseIFF() function to return control to the client. Client programs can also provide their own custom handlers. The control flag can have three values: IFFPARSE_SCAN: In this normal mode, ParseIFF() will only return control to the caller when either: 1) an error is encountered, 2) a stop chunk is encountered, or a user handler returns the special IFF_RETURN2CLIENT code, or 3) the end of the logical file is reached, in which case IFFERR_EOF is returned. ParseIFF() will continue pushing and popping chunks until one of these conditions occurs. If ParseIFF() is called again after returning, it will continue to parse the file where it left off. IFFPARSE_STEP and _RAWSTEP: In these two modes, ParseIFF() will return control to the caller after every step in the parse, specifically, after each push of a context node and just before each pop. If returning just before a pop, ParseIFF() will return IFFERR_EOC, which is not an error, per se, but is just an indication that the most recent context is ending. In STEP mode, ParseIFF() will invoke the handlers for chunks, if any, before returning. In RAWSTEP mode, ParseIFF() will not invoke any handlers and will return right away. In both cases the function can be called multiple times to step through the parsing of the IFF file. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle structure. control - control code (IFFPARSE_SCAN, _STEP or _RAWSTEP). RESULT error - 0 or IFFERR_#? value or return value from user handler.
