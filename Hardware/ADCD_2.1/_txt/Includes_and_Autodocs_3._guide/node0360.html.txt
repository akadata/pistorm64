iffparse.library/EntryHandler ]" border=0> NAME EntryHandler -- add an entry handler to the IFFHandle context. (V36) SYNOPSIS error = EntryHandler(iff, type, id, position, handler, object); D0 A0 D0 D1 D2 A1 A2 LONG EntryHandler(struct IFFHandle *, LONG , LONG , LONG , struct Hook *, APTR); FUNCTION Installs an entry handler vector for a specific type of chunk into the context for the given IFFHandle structure. Type and id are the longword identifiers for the chunk to handle. The handler is a client- supplied standard Hook structure, properly initialized. position tells where to put the handler in the context. The handler will be called whenever the parser enters a chunk of the given type, so the IFF stream will be positioned to read the first data byte in the chunk. The handler will execute in the same context as whoever called ParseIFF() . The handler will be called (through the hook) with the following arguments: A0: the Hook pointer you passed. A2: the 'object' pointer you passed. A1: pointer to a LONG containing the value IFFCMD_ENTRY. The error code your call-back routine returns will affect the parser in three different ways: Return value Result ------------ ------ 0: Normal success; ParseIFF() will continue through the file. IFF_RETURN2CLIENT: ParseIFF() will stop and return the value 0. (StopChunk() is internally implemented using this return value.) Any other value: ParseIFF() will stop and return the value you supplied. This is how errors should be returned. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle structure. type - type code for chunk to handle (ex. "ILBM"). id - ID code for chunk to handle (ex. "CMAP"). position- local context item position. One of the IFFSLI_#? codes. handler - pointer to Hook structure. object - a client-defined pointer which is passed in A2 during call- back. RESULT error - 0 if successful or an IFFERR_#? error code if unsuccessful. BUGS Returning the values IFFERR_EOF or IFFERR_EOC from the call-back routine *may* confuse the parser. There is no way to explicitly remove a handler once installed. However, by installing a do-nothing handler using IFFSLI_TOP, previous handlers will be overridden until the context expires.
