audio.device/ADCMD_WAITCYCLE ]" border=0> NAME ADCMD_WAITCYCLE -- wait for an audio channel to complete the current cycle of a write FUNCTION ADCMD_WAITCYCLE is a command for a single audio channel (io_Unit). If the allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) is correct and there is a write (CMD_WRITE) in progress on selected channel, ADCMD_WAITCYCLE does not reply (mn_ReplyPort) until the end of the current cycle. If there is no write is progress, ADCMD_WAITCYCLE replies immediately. If the allocation key is incorrect, ADCMD_WAITCYCLE returns an error (ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION). ADCMD_WAITCYCLE returns an error (IOERR_ABORTED) if it is canceled (AbortIO) or the channel is stolen (ADCMD_ALLOCATE). ADCMD_WAITCYCLE is only asynchronous if it is waiting for a cycle to complete, in which case it clears the quick flag (IOF_QUICK); otherwise, it is synchronous and only replies if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear. Do not use ADCMD_WAITCYCLE in interrupt code at interrupt level 5 or higher. INPUTS mn_ReplyPort- pointer to message port that receives I/O request, if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear, or if a write is in progress on the selected channel and a cycle has completed io_Device - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function io_Unit - bit map of channel to wait for cycle (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3), if more then one bit is set lowest bit number channel is used io_Command - command number for CMD_WAITCYCLE io_Flags - flags, must be cleared if not used: IOF_QUICK - (CLEAR) reply I/O request (SET) only reply I/O request if a write is in progress on the selected channel and a cycle has completed ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function or ADCMD_ALLOCATE command OUTPUTS io_Unit - bit map of channel that successfully waited for cycle (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Flags - IOF_QUICK flag cleared if a write is in progress on the selected channel io_Error - error number: 0 - no error IOERR_ABORTED - canceled (AbortIO) or channel stolen ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION - allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) does not match key for channel [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
