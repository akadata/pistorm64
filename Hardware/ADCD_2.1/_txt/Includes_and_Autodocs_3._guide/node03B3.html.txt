SYNOPSIS FreeSysRequest( Window ) A0 VOID FreeSysRequest( struct Window * ); FUNCTION This routine frees up all memory allocated by a successful call to the BuildSysRequest() procedure. If BuildSysRequest() returned a pointer to a window, then you are able to wait on the message port of that window to detect an event which satisfies the requester. When you want to remove the requester, you call this procedure. It ends the requester and deallocates any memory used in the creation of the requester. It also closes the special window that was opened for your system requester. For V36: It's OK if you pass a NULL or a TRUE (1) value to this function. Also, this function properly disposes of requesters gotten using BuildEasyRequestArgs() . INPUTS Window = value of the window pointer returned by a successful call to the BuildSysRequest() procedure RESULT None BUGS SEE ALSO BuildSysRequest() , AutoRequest() , CloseWindow() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
