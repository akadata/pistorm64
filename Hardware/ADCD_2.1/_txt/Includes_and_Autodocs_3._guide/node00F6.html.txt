(V36) SYNOPSIS oldPri = SetCxObjPri(co,pri) D0 A0 D0 LONG SetCxObjPri(CxObj *,LONG); FUNCTION This function sets the priority of a commodity object for the purposes of EnqueueCxObj() . It is strongly recommended that the ToolTypes environment be utilized to provide end-user control over the priority of brokers, but application specific ordering of other objects within their lists is not dictated. INPUTS co - the commodity object to affect (may be NULL) pri - the object's new priority in the range -128 to +127. A value of 0 is normal. RESULTS oldPri - the previous priority of the object or 0 if 'co' was NULL. This value is only returned in V38 and beyond. BUGS This function will not reposition an object within its list when its priority changes. To attain the same effect, first remove the object from its list using RemoveCxObj() , set its priority using SetCxObjPri(), and reinsert it in the list using EnqueueCxObj() .
