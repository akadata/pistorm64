debug.lib/KPrintF ]" border=0> NAME KPrintF - print formatted data to the console (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud) SYNOPSIS KPrintF("format string",values) A0 A1 FUNCTION print a formatted C-type string to the console. See the exec RawDoFmt() call for the supported % formatting commands. INPUTS "format string" - A C style string with % commands to indicate where paramters are to be inserted. values - A pointer to an array of paramters, to be inserted into specified places in the string. KPutFmt and KPrintF are identical assembly interfaces that want the two pointers in registers. _KPrintF and _kprintf are C interfaces that expect the format string pointer on the stack, and the paramters on the stack above that. SEE ALSO exec.library/RawDoFmt , any C compiler's "printf" call. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
