So, whereas BltBitMap() requires pointers to BitMaps, ClipBlit requires pointers to the RastPorts that contain the Bitmaps, Layers, etcetera. If you are going to blit blocks of data around via the RastPort of your Intuition Window , you must call this routine (rather than BltBitMap() ). Either the Src RastPort , the Dest RastPort , both, or neither, can have Layers. This routine takes care of all cases. See BltBitMap() for a thorough explanation. INPUTS Src = pointer to the RastPort of the source for your blit SrcX, SrcY = the topleft offset into Src for your data Dest = pointer to the RastPort to receive the blitted data DestX, DestY = the topleft offset into the destination RastPort XSize = the width of the blit (must be ta least 1) YSize = the height of the blit (must be at least 1) Minterm = the boolean blitter function, where SRCB is associated with the Src RastPort and SRCC goes to the Dest RastPort RESULT BUGS SEE ALSO BltBitMap() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
