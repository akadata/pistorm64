exec.library/AllocPooled ]" border=0> NAME AllocPooled -- Allocate memory with the pool manager (V39) SYNOPSIS memory=AllocPooled(poolHeader,memSize) d0 a0 d0 void *AllocPooled(void *,ULONG); FUNCTION Allocate memSize bytes of memory, and return a pointer. NULL is returned if the allocation fails. Doing a DeletePool() on the pool will free all of the puddles and thus all of the allocations done with AllocPooled() in that pool. (No need to FreePooled() each allocation) INPUTS memSize - the number of bytes to allocate poolHeader - a specific private pool header. RESULT A pointer to the memory, or NULL. The memory block returned is long word aligned. NOTES The pool function do not protect an individual pool from multiple accesses. The reason is that in most cases the pools will be used by a single task. If your pool is going to be used by more than one task you must Semaphore protect the pool from having more than one task trying to allocate within the same pool at the same time. Warning: Forbid() protection *will not work* in the future. *Do NOT* assume that we will be able to make it work in the future. AllocPooled() may well break a Forbid() and as such can only be protected by a semaphore. To track sizes yourself, the following code can be used: Assumes a6=ExecBase ; ; Function to do AllocVecPooled(Pool,memSize) ; AllocVecPooled: addq.l #4,d0 ; Get space for tracking move.l d0,-(sp) ; Save the size jsr _LVOAllocPooled(a6) ; Call pool... move.l (sp)+,d1 ; Get size back... tst.l d0 ; Check for error beq.s avp_fail ; If NULL, failed! move.l d0,a0 ; Get pointer... move.l d1,(a0)+ ; Store size move.l a0,d0 ; Get result avp_fail: rts ; return ; ; Function to do FreeVecPooled(pool,memory) ; FreeVecPooled: move.l -(a1),d0 ; Get size / ajust pointer jmp _LVOFreePooled(a6) SEE ALSO FreePooled() , CreatePool() , DeletePool() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
