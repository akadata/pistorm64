realtime.library/NextConductor ]" border=0> NAME NextConductor -- return the next conductor on realtime.library's conductor list. (V37) SYNOPSIS conductor = NextConductor(previousConductor); D0 A0 struct Conductor *NextConductor(struct Conductor *); FUNCTION Returns the next conductor on realtime.library's conductor list. If previousConductor is NULL, returns the first conductor in the list. Returns NULL if no more conductors. The conductor list must be locked before calling this function. This is done by calling LockRealTime(RT_CONDUCTORS). INPUTS previousConductor - previous conductor or NULL to get first conductor. RESULTS conductor - next conductor on the list, or NULL if no more.
