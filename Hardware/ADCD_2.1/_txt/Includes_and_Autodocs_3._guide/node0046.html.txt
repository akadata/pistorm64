amiga.lib/LibFreePooled ]" border=0> NAME LibFreePooled -- Free pooled memory (V33) SYNOPSIS LibFreePooled(poolHeader,memory,memSize) a0 a1 d0 void LibFreePooled(void *,void *,ULONG); FUNCTION This function is a copy of the pool functions in V39 and up of EXEC. In fact, if you are running in V39, this function will notice and call the EXEC function. This function works in V33 and up (1.2) Amiga system. The C code interface is _LibFreePooled() and takes its arguments from the stack just like the C code interface for FreePooled() in amiga.lib. The assembly code interface is with the symbol _AsmFreePooled: and takes the parameters in registers with the additional parameter of ExecBase being in a6 which can be used from SAS/C 6 by a prototype of: void __asm AsmFreePooled(register __a0 void *, register __a1 void *, register __d0 ULONG, register __a6 struct ExecBase *); Deallocates memory allocated by LibAllocPooled() . The size of the allocation *MUST* match the size given to LibAllocPooled() . The reason the pool functions do not track individual allocation sizes is because many of the uses of pools have small allocation sizes and the tracking of the size would be a large overhead. Only memory allocated by LibAllocPooled() may be freed with this function! Doing a LibDeletePool() on the pool will free all of the puddles and thus all of the allocations done with LibAllocPooled() in that pool. (No need to LibFreePooled() each allocation) INPUTS memory - pointer to memory allocated by AllocPooled . poolHeader - a specific private pool header. NOTES The pool function do not protect an individual pool from multiple accesses. The reason is that in most cases the pools will be used by a single task. If your pool is going to be used by more than one task you must Semaphore protect the pool from having more than one task trying to allocate within the same pool at the same time. Warning: Forbid() protection *will not work* in the future. *Do NOT* assume that we will be able to make it work in the future. LibFreePooled() may well break a Forbid() and as such can only be protected by a semaphore. To track sizes yourself, the following code can be used: *Assumes a6=ExecBase* ; ; Function to do AllocVecPooled(Pool,memSize) ; AllocVecPooled: addq.l #4,d0 ; Get space for tracking move.l d0,-(sp) ; Save the size jsr LibAllocPooled ; Call pool... move.l (sp)+,d1 ; Get size back... tst.l d0 ; Check for error beq.s avp_fail ; If NULL, failed! move.l d0,a0 ; Get pointer... move.l d1,(a0)+ ; Store size move.l a0,d0 ; Get result avp_fail: rts ; return ; ; Function to do LibFreeVecPooled(pool,memory) ; FreeVecPooled: move.l -(a1),d0 ; Get size / ajust pointer jmp LibFreePooled SEE ALSO AllocPooled() , CreatePool() , DeletePool() , LibAllocPooled() , LibCreatePool() , LibDeletePool() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
