workbench.library/RemoveAppWindowDropZoneench.library/RemoveAppWindowDropZone ]" border=0> NAME RemoveAppWindowDropZone -- Remove a drop zone from an AppWindow . SYNOPSIS success = RemoveAppWindowDropZone(appWindow,dropZone) D0 A0 A1 BOOL RemoveAppWindowDropZone(struct AppWindow *, struct AppWindowDropZone *); FUNCTION Attempt to remove a drop zone from an AppWindow . INPUTS appWindow -- pointer to an AppWindow structure returned by workbench.library/AddAppWindowA . A value of NULL will be ignored. dropZone -- pointer to an AppWindowDropZone returned by workbench.library/AddAppWindowDropZoneA . A value of NULL will be ignored. RESULTS success - TRUE if the drop zone could be removed, FALSE otherwise. The reason for the failure can be obtained using dos.library/IoErr . This routine may fail if the specified drop zone is not registered with the AppWindow . NOTES Due to the asynchronous nature of Workbench/user interaction, you may receive AppIcon drop zone messages for zones that you have just removed. These messages may arrive in the time between your code calling RemoveAppWindowDropZone() and Workbench responding to the drop zone removal request. Be prepared to handle this. Once a drop zone is removed, it will generate no new AppMessages. SEE ALSO workbench.library/AddAppWindowDropZoneA [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
