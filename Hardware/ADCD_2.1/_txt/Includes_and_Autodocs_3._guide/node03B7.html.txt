intuition.library/GetDefPrefs ]" border=0> NAME GetDefPrefs -- Get a copy of the the Intuition default Preferences . SYNOPSIS Prefs = GetDefPrefs( PrefBuffer, Size ) D0 A0 D0 struct Preferences *GetDefPrefs( struct Preferences *, WORD ); FUNCTION Gets a copy of the Intuition default preferences data. Writes the data into the buffer you specify. The number of bytes you want copied is specified by the size argument. The default preferences are those that Intuition uses when it is first opened. If no preferences file is found, these are the preferences that are used. These would also be the startup preferences in an AmigaDOS-less environment. It is legal to take a partial copy of the Preferences structure. The more pertinent preferences variables have been grouped near the top of the structure to facilitate the memory conservation that can be had by taking a copy of only some of the Preferences structure. INPUTS PrefBuffer = pointer to the memory buffer to receive your copy of the Intuition Preferences structure Size = the number of bytes in your PrefBuffer, the number of bytes you want copied from the system's internal Preference settings RESULT Returns your parameter PrefBuffer.
