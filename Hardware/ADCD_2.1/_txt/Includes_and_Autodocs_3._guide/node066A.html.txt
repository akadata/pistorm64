The tag offset has a limited range so the base tag is * defined in the first longword. * * After the first longword, the fields look as follows: * * +--------- 1 = signed, 0 = unsigned (for bits, 1=inverted boolean) * | * | +------ 00 = Pack/Unpack, 10 = Pack, 01 = Unpack, 11 = special * | / \ * | | | +-- 00 = Byte, 01 = Word, 10 = Long, 11 = Bit * | | | / \ * | | | | | /----- For bit operations: 1 = TAG_EXISTS is TRUE * | | | | | | * | | | | | | /-------------------- Tag offset from base tag value * | | | | | | | \ * m n n o o p q q q q q q q q q q r r r s s s s s s s s s s s s s * \ | | | * Bit offset (for bit operations) ----/ | | * \ | * Offset into data structure -----------------------------------/ * * A -1 longword signifies that the next longword will be a new base tag * * A 0 longword signifies that it is the end of the pack table. * * What this implies is that there are only 13-bits of address offset * and 10 bits for tag offsets from the base tag. For most uses this * should be enough, but when this is not, either multiple pack tables * or a pack table with extra base tags would be able to do the trick. * The goal here was to make the tables small and yet flexible enough to * handle most cases. */ #define PSTB_SIGNED 31 #define PSTB_UNPACK 30 /* Note that these are active low... */ #define PSTB_PACK 29 /* Note that these are active low... */ #define PSTB_EXISTS 26 /* Tag exists bit true flag hack... */ #define PSTF_SIGNED (1L > 8))) #define PK_BITNUM(flg) ((flg > 16))) #define PK_WORDOFFSET(flg) ((flg) field)) /*****************************************************************************/ /* Some handy dandy macros to easily create pack tables * * Use PACK_STARTTABLE() at the start of a pack table. You pass it the * base tag value that will be handled in the following chunk of the pack * table. * * PACK_ENDTABLE() is used to mark the end of a pack table. * * PACK_NEWOFFSET() lets you change the base tag value used for subsequent * entries in the table * * PACK_ENTRY() lets you define an entry in the pack table. You pass it the * base tag value, the tag of interest, the type of the structure to use, * the field name in the structure to affect and control bits (combinations of * the various PKCTRL_XXX bits) * * PACK_BYTEBIT() lets you define a bit-control entry in the pack table. You * pass it the same data as PACK_ENTRY, plus the flag bit pattern this tag * affects. This macro should be used when the field being affected is byte * sized. * * PACK_WORDBIT() lets you define a bit-control entry in the pack table. You * pass it the same data as PACK_ENTRY, plus the flag bit pattern this tag * affects. This macro should be used when the field being affected is word * sized. * * PACK_LONGBIT() lets you define a bit-control entry in the pack table. You * pass it the same data as PACK_ENTRY, plus the flag bit pattern this tag * affects. This macro should be used when the field being affected is longword * sized. * * EXAMPLE: * * ULONG packTable[] = * { * PACK_STARTTABLE(GA_Dummy), * PACK_ENTRY(GA_Dummy,GA_Left,Gadget,LeftEdge,PKCTRL_WORD|PKCTRL_PACKUNPACK), * PACK_ENTRY(GA_Dummy,GA_Top,Gadget,TopEdge,PKCTRL_WORD|PKCTRL_PACKUNPACK), * PACK_ENTRY(GA_Dummy,GA_Width,Gadget,Width,PKCTRL_UWORD|PKCTRL_PACKUNPACK), * PACK_ENTRY(GA_Dummy,GA_Height,Gadget,Height,PKCTRL_UWORD|PKCTRL_PACKUNPACK), * PACK_WORDBIT(GA_Dummy,GA_RelVerify,Gadget,Activation,PKCTRL_BIT|PKCTRL_PACKUNPACK,GACT_RELVERIFY) * PACK_ENDTABLE * }; */ #define PACK_STARTTABLE(tagbase) (tagbase) #define PACK_NEWOFFSET(tagbase) (-1L),(tagbase) #define PACK_ENDTABLE 0 #define PACK_ENTRY(tagbase,tag,type,field,control) (control | ((tag-tagbase) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
