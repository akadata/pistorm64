(V36) SYNOPSIS Success = ResetMenuStrip( Window , Menu ) D0 A0 A1 BOOL ResetMenuStrip( struct Window *, struct Menu * ); FUNCTION This function is simply a "fast" version of SetMenuStrip() that doesn't perform the precalculations of menu page sizes that SetMenuStrip() does. You may call this function ONLY IF the menu strip and all items and sub-items have not changed since the menu strip was passed to SetMenuStrip() , with the following exceptions: - You may change the CHECKED flag to turn a checkmark on or off. - You may change the ITEMENABLED flag to enable/disable some MenuItem or Menu structures. In all other ways, this function performs like SetMenuStrip() . The new sequence of events you can use is: - OpenWindow() - SetMenuStrip() zero or more iterations of: - ClearMenuStrip() - change CHECKED or ITEMENABLED flags - ResetMenuStrip() - ClearMenuStrip() - CloseWindow() INPUTS Window = pointer to a Window structure Menu = pointer to the first menu in the menu strip RESULT TRUE always.
