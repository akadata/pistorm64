gadtools.library/LayoutMenusA ]" border=0> NAME LayoutMenusA -- position all the menus and menu items. (V36) LayoutMenus -- varargs stub for LayoutMenusA(). (V36) SYNOPSIS success = LayoutMenusA(menu, vi, tagList) D0 A0 A1 A2 BOOL LayoutMenusA(struct Menu *, APTR , struct TagItem *); success = LayoutMenus(menu, vi, firsttag, ...) BOOL LayoutMenus(struct Menu *, APTR , Tag , ...); FUNCTION Lays out all the menus, menu items and sub-items in the supplied menu according to the supplied visual information and tag parameters. This routine attempts to columnize and/or shift the MenuItems in the event that a menu would be too tall or too wide. INPUTS menu - pointer to menu obtained from CreateMenusA() . vi - pointer returned by GetVisualInfoA() . tagList - pointer to an array of tags providing optional extra parameters, or NULL. TAGS GTMN_TextAttr (struct TextAttr *) - Text Attribute to use for menu-items and sub-items. If not supplied, the screen's font will be used. This font must be openable via OpenFont() when this function is called. (V36) GTMN_NewLookMenus (BOOL) - If you ask for WA_NewLookMenus for your window, you should ask for this tag as well. This informs GadTools to use the appropriate checkmark, Amiga-key, and colors. (V39) GTMN_Checkmark (struct Image *) - If you are using a custom image for a checkmark (WA_Checkmark), also pass it to GadTools, so it can lay the menus out accordingly. (V39) GTMN_AmigaKey (struct Image *) - If you are using a custom image for the Amiga-key in menus (WA_AmigaKey), also pass it to GadTools, so it can lay the menus out accordingly. (V39) GTMN_FrontPen (ULONG) - This tag has existed for CreateMenus(), but now LayoutMenusA() has it too. If a legitimate pen number is supplied, it is used for coloring the menu items (in preference to anything passed to CreateMenus()). If GTMN_NewLookMenus has been specified, this tag defaults to using the screen's BARDETAILPEN, else it defaults to "do nothing". For visual consistency, we recommend you omit this tag in all functions, and let the defaults be used. (V39) RESULT success - TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise (signifies that the TextAttr wasn't openable). NOTES When using this function, there is no need to also call LayoutMenuItemsA() . BUGS If a menu ends up being wider than the whole screen, it will run off the right-hand side. SEE ALSO CreateMenusA() , GetVisualInfoA() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
