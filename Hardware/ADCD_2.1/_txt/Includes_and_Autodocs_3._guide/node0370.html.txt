iffparse.library/OpenIFF ]" border=0> NAME OpenIFF -- prepare an IFFHandle to read or write a new IFF stream. (V36) SYNOPSIS error = OpenIFF(iff, rwMode); D0 A0 D0 LONG OpenIFF(struct IFFHandle *, LONG); FUNCTION Initializes an IFFHandle structure for a new read or write. The direction of the I/O is given by the value of rwMode, which can be either IFFF_READ or IFFF_WRITE. As part of its initialization procedure, OpenIFF() calls the client- supplied stream hook vector. The IFFStreamCmd packet will contain the following: sc_Command: IFFCMD_INIT sc_Buf: (Not applicable) sc_NBytes: (Not applicable) This operation is permitted to fail. DO NOT write to this structure. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle structure. Starting with V39, this may be NULL, in which case IFFERR_NOMEM is returned. rwMode - IFFF_READ or IFFF_WRITE RESULT error - contains an error code or 0 if successful SEE ALSO CloseIFF() , InitIFF() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
