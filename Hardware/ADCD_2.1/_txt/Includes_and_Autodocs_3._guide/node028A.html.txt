gameport.device/GPD_READEVENT ]" border=0> NAME GPD_READEVENT -- Return the next game port event. FUNCTION Read game port events from the game port and put them in the data area of the iORequest. If there are no pending game port events, this command will not be satisfied, but if there are some events, but not as many as can fill IO_LENGTH, the request will be satisfied with those currently available. IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice io_Command GPD_READEVENT io_Flags IOB_QUICK set if quick I/O is possible io_Length the size of the io_Data area in bytes: there are sizeof(inputEvent) bytes per input event. io_Data a buffer area to fill with input events. The fields of the input event are: ie_NextEvent links the events returned ie_Class is IECLASS_RAWMOUSE ie_SubClass is 0 for the left, 1 for the right game port ie_Code contains any gameport button reports. No report is indicated by the value 0xff. ie_Qualifier only the relative and button bits are set ie_X, ie_Y the x and y values for this report, in either relative or absolute device dependent units. ie_TimeStamp the delta time since the last report, given not as a standard timestamp, but as the frame count in the TV_SECS field. RESULTS This function sets the error field in the iORequest, and fills the iORequest with the next game port events (but not partial events).
