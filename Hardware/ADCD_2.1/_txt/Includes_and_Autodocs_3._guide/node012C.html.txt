TITLE: disk.resource/AllocUnit

disk.resource/AllocUnit ]" border=0> NAME AllocUnit - allocate a unit of the disk SYNOPSIS Success = AllocUnit( unitNum ), DRResource D0 D0 A6 BOOL AllocUnit(LONG); FUNCTION This routine allocates one of the units of the disk. It should be called before trying to use the disk (via GetUnit). In reality, it is perfectly fine to use GetUnit/GiveUnit if AllocUnit fails. Do NOT call FreeUnit if AllocUnit did not succeed. This has been the case for all revisions of disk.resource. INPUTS unitNum -- a legal unit number (zero through three) RESULTS Success -- nonzero if successful. zero on failure.
