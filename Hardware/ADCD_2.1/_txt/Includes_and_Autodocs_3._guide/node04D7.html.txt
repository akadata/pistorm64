narrator.device/CMD_STOP ]" border=0> NAME CMD_STOP - Stops the device. SYNOPSIS Standard device command. FUNCTION CMD_STOP halts the currently active speech (if any) and prevents any queued requests from starting. INPUTS Valid IORequest block with the io_Command field set to CMD_STOP. A valid IORequest block is one with its io_Message structure, and io_Device and io_Unit fields properly initialized. The easiest way to insure proper initialization is to make a copy of the IORequest block after a successful OpenDevice call. RESULTS io_Error set to 0. SEE ALSO Exec input/output documentation.
