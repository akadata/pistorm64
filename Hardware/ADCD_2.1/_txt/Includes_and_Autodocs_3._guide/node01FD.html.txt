Each pool is a separate tracking system for memory of a specific type. Any number of pools may exist in the system. Pools automatically expand and shrink based on demand. Fixed sized "puddles" are allocated by the pool manager when more total memory is needed. Many small allocations can fit in a single puddle. Allocations larger than the threshSize are allocation in their own puddles. At any time individual allocations may be freed. Or, the entire pool may be removed in a single step. INPUTS memFlags - a memory flags specifier, as taken by AllocMem . puddleSize - the size of Puddles... threshSize - the largest allocation that goes into normal puddles This *MUST* be less than or equal to puddleSize (CreatePool() will fail if it is not) RESULT The address of a new pool header, or NULL for error.
