intuition.library/AddClass ]" border=0> NAME AddClass -- Make a public class available (V36) SYNOPSIS AddClass( Class ) A0 VOID AddClass( struct IClass * ); FUNCTION Adds a public boopsi class to the internal list of classes available for public consumption. You must call this function after you call MakeClass() . INPUTS Class = pointer returned by MakeClass() RESULT Nothing returned. NOTES BUGS Although there is some protection against creating classes with the same name as an existing class, this function does not do any checking or other dealings with like-named classes. Until this is rectified, only officially registered names can be used for public classes, and there is no "class replacement" policy in effect.
