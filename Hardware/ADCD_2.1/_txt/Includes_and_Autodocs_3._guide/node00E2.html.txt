commodities.library/AttachCxObj ]" border=0> NAME AttachCxObj -- attach a commodity object to the end of an existing list of objects. (V36) SYNOPSIS AttachCxObj(headObj,co); A0 A1 VOID AttachCxObj(CxObj *, CxObj *); FUNCTION Adds 'co' to the list of objects pointed to by 'headObj'. The new object is added at the end of the list. INPUTS headObj - pointer to a list of objects. If this value is NULL, then the entire tree of objects pointed to by 'co' is deleted and becomes invalid. co - the object to add to the list (may be NULL) RESULTS If 'co' is NULL, this function will record that fact in the internal accumulated error of 'headObj'. This error record can be retrieved using CxObjError() and cleared using ClearCxObjError() . BUGS Until V38, passing a NULL 'headObj' parameter would cause low-memory access and unpredictable results.
