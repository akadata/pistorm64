(V36) SYNOPSIS attr = GetAttr( AttrID, Object , StoragePtr ) D0 D0 A0 A1 ULONG GetAttr( ULONG, APTR , ULONG * ); FUNCTION Inquires from the specified object the value of the specified attribute. You always pass the address of a long variable, which will receive the same value that would be passed to SetAttrs() in the ti_Data portion of a TagItem element. See the documentation for the class for exceptions to this general rule. Not all attributes will respond to this function. Those that will are documented on a class-by-class basis. INPUTS AttrID = the attribute tag ID understood by the object's class Object = abstract pointer to the boopsi object you are interested in StoragePtr = pointer to appropriate storage for the answer RESULT Returns FALSE (0) if the inquiries of attribute are not provided by the object's class. NOTES This function invokes the OM_GET method of the object.
