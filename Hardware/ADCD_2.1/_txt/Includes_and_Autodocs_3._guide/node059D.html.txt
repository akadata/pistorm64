(V36) SYNOPSIS FilterTagChanges(changeList,originalList,apply); A0 A1 D0 VOID FilterTagChanges(struct TagItem *, struct TagItem *, ULONG); FUNCTION This function goes through changeList. For each item found in changeList, if the item is also present in originalList, and their data values are identical, then the tag is removed from changeList. If the two tag's data values are different and the 'apply' value is non-zero, then the tag data in originalList will be updated to match the value from changeList. INPUTS changeList - list of new tags (may be NULL) originalList - a list of existing tags (may be NULL) apply - boolean specification as to whether the data values in originalList are to be updated to the data values in changeList. EXAMPLE Assume you have an attribute list for an object (originalList) which looks like this: {ATTR_Size, "large"}, {ATTR_Color, "orange"}, {ATTR_Shape, "square"} If you receive a new tag list containing some changes (changeList), which looks like this: {ATTR_Size, "large"}, {ATTR_Shape, "triangle"} If you call FilterTagChanges(), changeList will be modified to contain only those attributes which are different from those in originalList. All other items will have their tag values set to TAG_IGNORE. The resulting changeList will become: {TAG_IGNORE, "large"}, {ATTR_Shape, "triangle"} If 'apply' was set to 0, originalList would be unchanged. If 'apply' was non-zero, originalList would be changed to: {ATTR_Size, "large"}, {ATTR_Color, "orange"}, {ATTR_Shape, "triangle"} SEE ALSO , ApplyTagChanges() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
