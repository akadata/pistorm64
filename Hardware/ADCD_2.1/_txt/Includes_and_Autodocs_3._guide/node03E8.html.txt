(V39) SYNOPSIS ScreenDepth( screen, flags, reserved ) A0 D0 A1 VOID ScreenDepth( struct Screen *, ULONG, APTR ); FUNCTION Brings the specified screen to the front or back, based on the supplied flags. Also allows control of screen depth-arranging within screen families. INPUTS screen = a pointer to the screen to move flags = one of SDEPTH_TOFRONT or SDEPTH_TOBACK (bringing the screen to front or back respectively). If the screen is an attached screen, then you may also specify SDEPTH_INFAMILY to move the screen within the screen family. If the screen is an attached screen and SDEPTH_INFAMILY is not specified, then the whole family will move, which is also the behavior of the ScreenToFront() and ScreenToBack() functions, as well as the user-interface controls. reserved = must be NULL for now. RESULT None NOTES ONLY the application which owns the screen should use SDEPTH_INFAMILY. It is incorrect style (and against the intentions of the screen opener) for programs such as commodities or mouse-helpers to move child screens around in their family. (Note that this is a style-behavior requirement; there is no technical requirement that the task calling this function need be the task which opened the screen).
