SYNOPSIS Success = ModifyIDCMP( Window , IDCMPFlags ) D0 (V37) A0 D0 BOOL ModifyIDCMP( struct Window *, ULONG ); /* returns BOOL in V37 and greater */ FUNCTION This routine modifies the state of your window's IDCMP (Intuition Direct Communication Message Port). The state is modified to reflect your desires as described by the flag bits in the value IDCMPFlags. The four actions that might be taken are: - if there is currently no IDCMP in the given window, and IDCMPFlags is zero, nothing happens - if there is currently no IDCMP in the given window, and any of the IDCMPFlags is selected (set), then the IDCMP of the window is created, including allocating and initializing the message ports and allocating a signal bit for your port. See the "Input and Output Methods" chapter of the Intuition Reference Manual for full details - if the IDCMP for the given window exists, and the IDCMPFlags argument is zero, this says that you want Intuition to close the ports, free the buffers and free your signal bit. You MUST be the same task that was active when this signal bit was allocated (either by ModifyIDCMP() or OpenWindow() ). - if the IDCMP for the given window is opened, and the IDCMPFlags argument is not zero, this means that you want to change the state of which events will be broadcast to you through the IDCMP NOTE: You can set up the Window->UserPort to any port of your own before you call ModifyIDCMP(). If IDCMPFlags is non-null but your UserPort is already initialized, Intuition will assume that it's a valid port with task and signal data preset and Intuition won't disturb your set-up at all, Intuition will just allocate the Intuition message port half of it. The converse is true as well: if UserPort is NULL when you call here with IDCMPFlags == NULL, Intuition will deallocate only the Intuition side of the port. This allows you to use a port that you already have allocated: - OpenWindow() with IDCMPFlags equal to NULL (open no ports) - set the UserPort variable of your window to any valid port of your own choosing - call ModifyIDCMP with IDCMPFlags set to what you want - then, to clean up later, set UserPort equal to NULL before calling CloseWindow() (leave IDCMPFlags alone) BUT FIRST: you must make sure that no messages sent your window are queued at the port, since they will be returned to the memory free pool. For an example of how to close a window with a shared IDCMP, see the description for CloseWindow() . INPUTS Window = pointer to the Window structure containing the IDCMP ports IDCMPFlags = the flag bits describing the new desired state of the IDCMP. The flags are: - IDCMP_REQVERIFY is the flag which, like IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY and ... - IDCMP_MENUVERIFY (see immediately below), specifies that you want to make sure that your graphical state is quiescent before something extraordinary happens. In this case, the extraordinary event is that a rectangle of graphical data is about to be blasted into your Window . If you're drawing directly into its screen, you probably will wish to make sure that you've ceased drawing before the user is allowed to bring up the DMRequest you've set up, and the same for when system has a request for the user. Set this flag to ask for that verification step. - IDCMP_REQCLEAR is the flag you set to hear a message whenever a requester is cleared from your window. If you are using IDCMP_REQVERIFY to arbitrate access to your screen's bitmap, it is safe to start your output once you have heard an IDCMP_REQCLEAR for each IDCMP_REQSET. - IDCMP_REQSET is a flag that you set to receive a broadcast for each requester that is opened in your window. Compare this with IDCMP_REQCLEAR above. This function is distinct from IDCMP_REQVERIFY. This functions merely tells you that a requester has opened, whereas IDCMP_REQVERIFY requires you to respond before the requester is opened. - IDCMP_MENUVERIFY is the flag you set to have Intuition stop and wait for you to finish all graphical output to your window before rendering the menus. Menus are currently rendered in the most memory-efficient way, which involves interrupting output to all windows in the screen before the menus are drawn. If you need to finish your graphical output before this happens, you can set this flag to make sure that you do. - IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY means that you will be doing output to your window which depends on a knowledge of the current size of the window. If the user wants to resize the window, you may want to make sure that any queued output completes before the sizing takes place (critical text, for instance). If this is the case, set this flag. Then, when the user wants to size, Intuition will send you the IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY message and Wait() until you reply that it's OK to proceed with the sizing. NOTE: when we say that Intuition will Wait() until you reply, what we're really saying is that user will WAIT until you reply, which suffers the great negative potential of User-Unfriendliness. So remember: use this flag sparingly, and, as always with any IDCMP Message you receive, reply to it promptly! Then, after user has sized the window, you can find out about it using IDCMP_NEWSIZE. With all the "VERIFY" functions, it is not save to leave them enabled at any time when your task may not be able to respond for a long period. It is NEVER safe to call AmigaDOS, directly or indirectly, when a "VERIFY" function is active. If AmigaDOS needs to put up a disk requester for you, your task might end up waiting for the requester to be satisfied, at the same time as Intuition is waiting for your response. The result is a complete machine lockup. USE ModifyIDCMP() TO TURN OFF ANY VERIFY MESSAGES BEFORE CALLING dos.library!! For V36: If you do not respond to the verification IntuiMessages within the user specified timeout duration, Intuition will abort the operation. This eliminates the threat of these easy deadlocks, but can result in a confused user. Please try hard to continue to avoid "logical deadlocks". - IDCMP_NEWSIZE is the flag that tells Intuition to send an IDCMP message to you after the user has resized your window. At this point, you could examine the size variables in your window structure to discover the new size of the window. See also the IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW IDCMP flag. - IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW when set will cause a message to be sent whenever your window needs refreshing. This flag makes sense only with WFLG_SIMPLE_REFRESH and WFLG_SMART_REFRESH windows. - IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS will get reports about mouse-button up/down events broadcast to you (Note: only the ones that don't mean something to Intuition. If the user clicks the select button over a gadget, Intuition deals with it and you don't find out about it through here). - IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE will work only if you've set the WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag above, or if one of your gadgets has the GACT_FOLLOWMOUSE flag set. Then all mouse movements will be reported here, providing your window is active. - IDCMP_GADGETDOWN means that when the User "selects" a gadget you've created with the GACT_IMMEDIATE flag set, the fact will be broadcast through the IDCMP. - IDCMP_GADGETUP means that when the user "releases" a gadget that you've created with the GACT_RELVERIFY flag set, the fact will be broadcast through the IDCMP. This message is only generated if the release is "good", such as releasing the select button over a Boolean gadget, or typing ENTER in a string gadget. - IDCMP_MENUPICK selects that menu number data will be sent via the IDCMP. - IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW means broadcast the IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW event through the IDCMP rather than the console. - IDCMP_RAWKEY selects that all IDCMP_RAWKEY events are transmitted via the IDCMP. Note that these are absolutely RAW keycodes, which you will have to translate before using. Setting this and the MOUSE flags effectively eliminates the need to open a Console device to get input from the keyboard and mouse. Of course, in exchange you lose all of the console features, most notably the "cooking" of input data and the systematic output of text to your window. - IDCMP_VANILLAKEY is for developers who don't want the hassle of IDCMP_RAWKEYS. This flag will return all the keycodes after translation via the current country-dependent keymap. When you set this flag, you will get IntuiMessages where the Code field has a decoded ANSI character code representing the key struck on the keyboard. Only codes that map to a single character are returned: you can't read such keys as HELP or the function keys with IDCMP_VANILLAKEY. NEW FOR V36: If you have both IDCMP_RAWKEY and IDCMP_VANILLAKEY set, Intuition will send an IDCMP_RAWKEY event for those *downstrokes* which do not map to single-byte characters ("non-vanilla" keys). In this way you can easily detect cursor keys, function keys, and the Help key without sacrificing the convenience of IDCMP_VANILLAKEY. NB: A side-effect of having both IDCMP_RAWKEY and IDCMP_VANILLAKEY set is that you never hear IDCMP_RAWKEY upstrokes, even for keys that caused IDCMP_RAWKEY downstrokes. - IDCMP_INTUITICKS gives you simple timer events from Intuition when your window is the active one; it may help you avoid opening and managing the timer device. With this flag set, you will get only one queued-up INTUITICKS message at a time. If Intuition notices that you've been sent an IDCMP_INTUITICKS message and haven't replied to it, another message will not be sent. Intuition receives timer events and considers sending you an IDCMP_INTUITICKS message approximately ten times a second. - IDCMP_DELTAMOVE gives raw (unscaled) input event delta X/Y values. This is so you can detect mouse motion regardless of screen/window/display boundaries. This works a little strangely: if you set both IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE and IDCMP_DELTAMOVE. IDCMPFlags, you will get IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE messages with delta x/y values in the MouseX and MouseY fields of the IDCMPMessage. - IDCMP_NEWPREFS indicates you wish to be notified when the system-wide Preferences changes. For V36, there is a new environment mechanism to replace Preferences , which we recommend you consider using instead. - Set IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW and IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW to get messages when those events happen to your window. Take care not to confuse this "ACTIVEWINDOW" with the familiar sounding, but totally different "WINDOWACTIVE" flag. These two flags have been supplanted by "IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW" and "WFLG_WINDOWACTIVE". Use the new equivalent terms to avoid confusion. - Set IDCMP_DISKINSERTED or IDCMP_DISKREMOVED to learn when removable disks are inserted or removed, respectively. - IDCMP_IDCMPUPDATE is a new class for V36 which is used as a channel of communication from custom and boopsi gadgets to your application. - IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW is a new class for V36 that will be sent to your window whenever its dimensions or position are changed by the user or the functions SizeWindow() , MoveWindow() , ChangeWindowBox() , or ZipWindow() . - IDCMP_MENUHELP is new for V37. If you specify the WA_MenuHelp tag when you open your window, then when the user presses the HELP key on the keyboard during a menu session, Intuition will terminate the menu session and issue this even in place of an IDCMP_MENUPICK message. - NEVER follow the NextSelect link for MENUHELP messages. - You will be able to hear MENUHELP for ghosted menus. (This lets you tell the user why the option is ghosted.) - Be aware that you can receive a MENUHELP message whose code corresponds to a menu header or an item that has sub-items (which does not happen for MENUPICK). The code may also be MENUNULL. - LIMITATION: if the user extend-selects some checkmarked items with the mouse, then presses MENUHELP, your application will only hear the MENUHELP report. You must re-examine the state of your checkmarks when you get a MENUHELP. - Availability of MENUHELP in V36 is not directly controllable. We apologize... - IDCMP_GADGETHELP is new for V39. If you turn on gadget help for your window (using the HelpControl() ) function, then Intuition will send IDCMP_GADGETHELP messages when the mouse passes over certain gadgets or your window. The IntuiMessage->Code field is normally ~0, but a boopsi gadget can return any word value it wishes. Ordinarily, gadget help is only processed for the active window. When Intuition has determined that the mouse is pointing at a gadget which has the GMORE_GADGETHELP property, you will be sent an IDCMP_GADGETHELP message whose IAddress points to the gadget. When the mouse is over your window but not over any help-aware gadget, you will be sent a message whose IAddress is the window itself. When the mouse is not over your window, Intuition sends a message whose IAddress is zero. A multi-window application can use the WA_HelpGroup or WA_HelpGroupWindow tags to indicate that all its windows belong in a group. (The help group identifier should be obtained with utility.library/GetUniqueID().) This makes Intuition test gadget help in all windows of the group when any one of them is the active one. Inactive windows whose WA_HelpGroup matches the active window's receive IDCMP_GADGETHELP messages when the mouse is over that window or any of its help-aware gadgets. The GADGETHELP message with an IAddress of zero means the mouse is not over the active window or any other window of the same group. It is always sent to the active window (which is not necessarily the window in your group that last got a message). To maximize performance, gadget help is not checked while the mouse is travelling quickly, or if it has not moved at all since the last test. As well, if Intuition discovers that the mouse is still over same gadget and that gadget does not wish to send a different IntuiMessage->Code from the last message, no new IntuiMessage is sent. RESULT Starting in V37, this function returns NULL if it was unable to create the necessary message ports. (The possibility of failure exists in earlier releases, but no return code was offered). Do not check the return code under V36 or earlier. BUGS SEE ALSO OpenWindowTagList() , OpenWindow() , CloseWindow() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
