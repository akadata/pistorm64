exec.library/CheckIO ]" border=0> NAME CheckIO -- get the status of an IORequest SYNOPSIS result = CheckIO(IORequest) D0 A1 struct IORequest *CheckIO(struct IORequest *); FUNCTION This function determines the current state of an I/O request and returns FALSE if the I/O has not yet completed. This function effectively hides the internals of the I/O completion mechanism. CheckIO() will NOT remove the returned IORequest from the reply port. This is best performed with WaitIO() . If the request has already completed, WaitIO() will return quickly. Use of the Remove() function is dangerous, since other tasks may still be adding things to your message port; a Disable() would be required. This function should NOT be used to busy loop (looping until IO is complete). WaitIO() is provided for that purpose. INPUTS iORequest - pointer to an I/O request block RESULTS result - NULL if I/O is still in progress. Otherwise D0 points to the IORequest block. NOTE CheckIO can hang if called on an IORequest that has never been used. This occurs if LN_TYPE of the IORequest is set to "NT_MESSAGE". Instead simply set LN_TYPE to 0.
