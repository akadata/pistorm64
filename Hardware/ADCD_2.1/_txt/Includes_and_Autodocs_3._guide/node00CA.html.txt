cia.resource/RemICRVector ]" border=0> NAME RemICRVector -- Detach an interrupt handler from a CIA bit. SYNOPSIS RemICRVector( Resource, iCRBit, interrupt ) A6 D0 A1 void RemICRVector( struct Library *, WORD, struct Interrupt *); FUNCTION Disconnect interrupt processing code for a particular interrupt bit of the CIA ICR. This function will also disable the CIA interrupt for the given ICR bit. INPUTS iCRBit Bit number to set (0..4). interrupt Pointer to interrupt structure. RESULT NOTE The CIA resources are special in that there is more than one of them in the system. Because of this, the C language stubs in amiga.lib for the CIA resources require an extra parameter to specify which CIA resource to use. The synopsis for the amiga.lib stubs is as follows: RemICRVector( Resource, iCRBit, interrupt ) A6 D0 A1 void RemICRVector( struct Library *, WORD, struct Interrupt *); SEE ALSO cia.resource/AddICRVector() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
