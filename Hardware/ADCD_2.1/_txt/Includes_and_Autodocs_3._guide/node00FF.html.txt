console.device/CDInputHandler ]" border=0> NAME CDInputHandler -- handle an input event for the console device SYNOPSIS events = CDInputHandler(events, consoleDevice) a0 a1 FUNCTION Accept input events from the producer, which is usually the rom input.task. INPUTS events - a pointer to a list of input events. consoleDevice - a pointer to the library base address of the console device. This has the same value as ConsoleDevice described below. RESULTS events - a pointer to a list of input events not used by this handler. NOTES This function is available for historical reasons. It is preferred that input events be fed to the system via the WriteEvent command of the input.device. This function is different from standard device commands in that it is a function in the console device library vectors. In order to obtain a valid library base pointer for the console device (a.k.a. ConsoleDevice) call OpenDevice("console.device", -1, IOStdReq , 0), and then grab the io_Device pointer field out of the IOStdReq and use as ConsoleDevice.
