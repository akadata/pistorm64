graphics.library/WriteChunkyPixels ]" border=0> NAME WriteChunkyPixels -- write the pen number value of a rectangular array of pixels starting at a specified x,y location and continuing through to another x,y location within a certain RastPort . (V40) SYNOPSIS WriteChunkyPixels(rp,xstart,ystart,xstop,ystop,array,bytesperrow) A0 D0 D1 D2 D3 A2 D4 VOID WriteChunkyPixels(struct RastPort *, LONG , LONG , LONG , LONG , UBYTE *, LONG); FUNCTION For each pixel in a rectangular region, decode the pen number selector from a linear array of pen numbers into the bit-planes used to describe a particular rastport. INPUTS rp - pointer to a RastPort structure (xstart,ystart) - starting point in the RastPort (xstop,ystop) - stopping point in the RastPort array - pointer to an array of UBYTEs from which to fetch the pixel data. bytesperrow - The number of bytes per row in the source array. This should be at least as large as the number of pixels being written per line. RESULT NOTE xstop must be >= xstart ystop must be >= ystart The source array can be in fast RAM. ===chunky-to-planar conversion HW: GfxBase->ChunkyToPlanarPtr is either NULL, or a pointer to a HW register used to aid in the process of converting 8-bit chunky pixel data into the bit-plane format used by the Amiga custom display chips. If NULL, then such hardware is not present. If an expansion device provides hardware which operates compatibly, than it can install the HW address into this pointer at boot time, and the system will use it. This pointer may be used for direct access to the chunky-to-planar conversion HW, if more is desired than the straight chunky-pixel copy that is performed by WriteChunkyPixels(). If using the hardware directly, it should only be accessed when the task using it has control of the blitter (via OwnBlitter() ), since this is the locking used to arbitrate usage of this device. The hardware may be viewed as a device which accepts 32 8-bit chunky pixels and outputs 8 longwords of bitplane data. For proper operation, exactly 8 longwords (containing 32 pixels) of chunky data should be written to *(GfxBase->ChunkyToPlanarPtr). After the data is written, bitplane data (starting with plane 0) can be read back a longword at a time. There is no need to read back all 8 longwords if the high-order bitplanes are not needed. Since WriteChunkyPixels is not (currently) particularly fast on systems without the chunky-to-planar hardware, time critical applications (games, etc) may want to use their own custom conversion routine if GfxBase->ChunkyToPlanarPtr is NULL, and call WriteChunkyPixels() otherwise. This pointer is only present in GfxBase in versions of graphics.library >= 40, so this should be checked before the pointer is read. BUGS Not very fast on systems without chunky-to-planar conversion hardware. SEE ALSO WritePixel() graphics/rastport.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
