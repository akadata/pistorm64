card.resource/CardAccessSpeed ]" border=0> NAME CardAccessSpeed -- Select best possible memory access speed. SYNOPSIS result=CardAccessSpeed( handle, nanoseconds ); d0 a1 d0 ULONG CardAccessSpeed( struct CardHandle *, ULONG ); FUNCTION This function is used to set memory access speed for all CPU accesses to card memory. Typically this information would be determined by first examining the Card Information Structure. Then you would use this function to let the card.resource select the best possible access speed for you, however note that the range of possible access speeds may vary on some machines (depending on the type of credit-card interface hardware being provided). INPUTS handle - Same handle as that used when OwnCard() was called. nanoseconds - Preferred access speed in nanoseconds. RETURNS Speed - Access speed selected by resource (in nanoseconds). 0 - Not successful. Either because the credit-card was removed, or the access speed you requested is slower than that supported by the credit-card interface hardware. NOTES This function may be called from within a task, or from a level 1 or level 2 interrupt. SEE ALSO OwnCard() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
