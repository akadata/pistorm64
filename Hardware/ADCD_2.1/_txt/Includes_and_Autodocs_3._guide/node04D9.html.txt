narrator.device/OpenDevice ]" border=0> NAME OpenDevice - opens the narrator device. SYNOPSIS error = OpenDevice("narrator.device", unit, IORequest , flags); D0 A0 D0 A1 D1 FUNCTION The OpenDevice routine grants access to the narrator device. OpenDevice checks the unit number, and if non-zero, returns an error (ND_UnitErr). If this is the first time the driver has been opened, OpenDevice will attempt to open the audio device and allocate the driver's static buffers. If either of these operations fail, an error is returned. See the .h and .i include files for possible error return codes. Next, OpenDevice (done for all opens, not just the first one) initializes various fields in the user's IORequest block (see below). If users wish to use non-default values for these parms, the values must be set after the open is done. OpenDevice also assigns a pseudo unit number to the IORB for use in synchronizing read and write requests. See the read command for more details. Finally, OpenDevice stores the device node pointer in the IORequest block and clears the delayed expunge bit. ***** NEW FOR V37 NARRATOR ***** Several new fields in the IORequest block have been added for V37 narrator. These fields are initialized when the device is opened if the NDB_NEWIORB bit is set in the flags field of the user's IORequest block. Note that NDB_NEWIORB is set in the IORequest block, NOT in the "flags" input parm to the OpenDevice call. INPUTS device - "narrator.device" unit - 0 IORequest - Pointer to the user's IORequest block flags - 0 RESULTS The narrator device will initialize the IORequest block as follows (assume IORB points to the IOrequest block): IORB->rate = 150; /* Speaking rate in words/minute */ IORB->pitch = 110; /* Baseline pitch in Hertz */ IORB->mode = NATURALF0; /* Pitch (F0) mode */ IORB->sex = MALE; /* Sex of voice */ IORB->volume = 64 /* Volume, full on */ IORB->sampfreq = 22200 /* Audio sampling freq */ IORB->mouths = 0 /* Don't generate sync events */ and if the NDB_NEWIORB bit is set: IORB->F0enthusiasm = 0 /* F0 excursion factor */ IORB->F0perturb = 32 /* F0 perturbation (in 32nds) */ IORB->F1adj = 0 /* F1 adjustment in ±5% steps */ IORB->F2adj = 0 /* F2 adjustment in ±5% steps */ IORB->F3adj = 0 /* F3 adjustment in ±5% steps */ IORB->A1adj = 0 /* A1 adjustment in decibels */ IORB->A2adj = 0 /* A2 adjustment in decibels */ IORB->A3adj = 0 /* A3 adjustment in decibels */ IORB->articulate = 100 /* Transition time multiplier */ IORB->centralize = 0 /* Degree of vowel centralization */ IORB->centphon = "" /* Pointer to central ASCII phon */ IORB->AVbias = 0 /* AV bias */ IORB->AFbias = 0 /* AF bias */ IORB->priority = 100 /* Priority while speaking */ SEE ALSO The include files contain the complete IORequest block definition, default settings, and error return codes.
