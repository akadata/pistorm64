(V36) SYNOPSIS E_Freq = ReadEClock( Dest ) D0 A0 ULONG ReadEClock ( struct EClockVal * ); FUNCTION This routine calculates the current 64 bit value of the E-Clock and stores it in the destination EClockVal structure. The count rate of the E-Clock is also returned. A0 will be left unchanged This is a low overhead function designed so that very short intervals may be timed. INPUTS Dest -- pointer to an EClockVal structure. RETURNS Dest -- the EClockVal structure will contain the E-Clock time E_Freq -- The count rate of the E-Clock (tics/sec).
