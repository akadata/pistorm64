iffparse.library/InitIFF ]" border=0> NAME InitIFF -- initialize an IFFHandle structure as a user stream. (V36) SYNOPSIS InitIFF(iff, flags, streamHook); A0 D0 A1 VOID InitIFF(struct IFFHandle *, LONG , struct Hook *); FUNCTION Initializes an IFFHandle as a general user-defined stream by allowing the user to declare a hook that the library will call to accomplish the low-level reading, writing, and seeking of the stream. Flags are the stream I/O flags for the specified stream; typically a combination of the IFFF_?SEEK flags. The stream vector is called with the following arguments: A0: pointer to streamhook. A2: pointer to IFFHandle structure. A1: pointer to IFFStreamCmd structure. The IFFStreamCmd packet appears as follows: sc_Command: Contains an IFFCMD_#? value sc_Buf: Pointer to memory buffer sc_NBytes: Number of bytes involved in operation The values taken on by sc_Command, and their meaning, are as follows: IFFCMD_INIT: Prepare your stream for reading. This is used for certain streams that can't be read immediately upon opening, and need further preparation. (The clipboard.device is an example of such a stream.) This operation is allowed to fail; any error code will be returned directly to the client. sc_Buf and sc_NBytes have no meaning here. IFFCMD_CLEANUP: Terminate the transaction with the associated stream. This is used with streams that can't simply be closed. (Again, the clipboard is an example of such a stream.) This operation is not permitted to fail; any error returned will be ignored (best to return 0, though). sc_Buf and sc_NBytes have no meaning here. IFFCMD_READ: Read from the stream. You are to read sc_NBytes from the stream and place them in the buffer pointed to by sc_Buf. Any (non-zero) error returned will be remapped by the parser into IFFERR_READ. IFFCMD_WRITE: Write to the stream. You are to write sc_NBytes to the stream from the buffer pointed to by sc_Buf. Any (non-zero) error returned will be remapped by the parser into IFFERR_WRITE. IFFCMD_SEEK: Seek on the stream. You are to perform a seek on the stream relative to the current position. sc_NBytes is signed; negative values mean seek backward, positive values mean seek forward. sc_Buf has no meaning here. Any (non-zero) error returned will be remapped by the parser into IFFERR_SEEK. All errors are returned in D0. A return of 0 indicates success. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you permitted to write to the IFFStreamCmd structure. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle structure to initialize. flags - stream I/O flags for the IFFHandle . streamHook - pointer to Hook structure. SEE ALSO , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
