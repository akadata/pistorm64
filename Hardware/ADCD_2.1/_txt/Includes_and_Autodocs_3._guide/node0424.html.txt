layers.library/InstallClipRegion ]" border=0> NAME InstallClipRegion -- Install clip region in layer SYNOPSIS oldclipregion = InstallClipRegion( l, region ) d0 a0 a1 struct Region *InstallClipRegion( struct Layer *, struct Region *); FUNCTION Installs a transparent Clip region in the layer. All subsequent graphics calls will be clipped to this region. You MUST remember to call InstallClipRegion(l,NULL) before calling DeleteLayer(l) or the Intuition function CloseWindow() if you have installed a non-NULL ClipRegion in l. INPUTS l - pointer to a layer region - pointer to a region RESULTS oldclipregion - The pointer to the previous ClipRegion that was installed. Returns NULL if no previous ClipRegion installed. Note: If the system runs out of memory while computing the resulting ClipRects the LAYERS_CLIPRECTS_LOST bit will be set in l->Flags. BUGS If the system runs out of memory during normal layer operations, the ClipRect list may get swept away and not restored. As soon as there is enough memory and the layer library gets called again the ClipRect list will be rebuilt.
