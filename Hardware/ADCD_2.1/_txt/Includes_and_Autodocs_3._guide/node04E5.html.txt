page_gc/PAGE_GetClass ]" border=0> NAME PAGE_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the Page class. SYNOPSIS page_class = PAGE_GetClass(); D0 Class * PAGE_GetClass(VOID); FUNCTION Obtains the pointer to the page gadget class for use with NewObject() . This function always returns a valid pointer so you do not need to check it. The reason is that if the library opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup. (Of course this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be calling this.) Note that this function does not create the class, that is done when the class library is opened. INPUTS Nothing. NOTES PAGE_GetClass() is contained in layout.gadget. There is no PageBase, just LayoutBase. RESULT page_class - Pointer to the page gadget class. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
