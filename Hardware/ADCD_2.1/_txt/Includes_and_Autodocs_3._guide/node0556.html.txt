serial.device/AbortIO ]" border=0> NAME AbortIO(ioRequest) -- abort an I/O request A1 FUNCTION This is an exec.library call. This function attempts to aborts a specified read or write request. If the request is active, it is stopped immediately. If the request is queued, it is painlessly removed. The request will be returned in the same way any completed request it. After AbortIO(), you must generally do a WaitIO() . INPUTS iORequest -- pointer to the IORequest Block that is to be aborted. RESULTS io_Error -- if the Abort succeded, then io_Error will be #IOERR_ABORTED (-2) and the request will be flagged as aborted (bit 5 of io_Flags is set). If the Abort failed, then the Error will be zero. BUGS Previous to version 34, the serial.device would often hang when aborting CTS/RTS handshake requests. This was the cause of the incorrect assumption that AbortIO() does not need to be followed by a wait for a reply (or a WaitIO()). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
