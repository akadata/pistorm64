commodities.library/ActivateCxObj ]" border=0> NAME ActivateCxObj -- change the activation state of a commodity object. (V36) SYNOPSIS previous = ActivateCxObj(co,true); D0 A0 D0 LONG ActivateCxObj(CxObj *,LONG); FUNCTION Commodity objects of all types maintain an activation state. If an object is "active", then it performs its particular action whenever a commodity message arrives. If the object is "inactive" no action is taken, and the message goes on to its next destination. All objects are created in the "active" state except brokers which are created "inactive". Thus, after you create your broker and hang a tree of objects off of it, you must remember to use this function to activate it. This causes it to divert all messages to your tree of objects. This function activates 'co' if 'true' is different than 0. and deactivates it otherwise. The previous activation state is returned. INPUTS co - the commodity object to affect (may be NULL) true - 0 to deactivate the object, anything else to activate it RESULTS previous - the previous activation state: 0 if the object was inactive or if 'co' was NULL, anything else if the object was active SEE ALSO CxBroker() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
