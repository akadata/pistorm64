amiga.lib/DoSuperMethod ]" border=0> NAME DoSuperMethod -- Perform method on object coerced to superclass. SYNOPSIS result = DoSuperMethod( cl, obj, MethodID, ... ) ULONG DoSuperMethod( struct IClass *, Object *, ULONG, ... ); FUNCTION Boopsi support function that invokes the supplied message on the specified object, as though it were the superclass of the specified class. Equivalent to DoSuperMethodA() , but allows you to build the message on the stack. INPUTS cl - pointer to boopsi class whose superclass is to receive the message obj - pointer to boopsi object ... - method-specific message built on the stack RESULT result - class and message-specific result. NOTES This function first appears in the V37 release of amiga.lib. While it intrinsically does not require any particular release of the system software to operate, it is designed to work with the boopsi subsystem of Intuition, which was only introduced in V36.
