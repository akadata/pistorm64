(V36) SYNOPSIS translatorObj = CxTranslate(ie); CxObj *CxTranslate(struct InputEvent *); FUNCTION This function creates a Commodities 'translator' object. The action of this object on receiving a Commodities message is to replace that message in the commodities network with a chain of Commodities input messages. There is one new Commodities input message generated for each input event in the linked list starting at 'ie' (and NULL terminated). The routing information of the new input messages is copied from the input message they replace. The linked list of input events associated with a translator object can be changed using the SetTranslate() function. If 'ie' is NULL, the null translation occurs: that is, the original commodities input message is disposed, and no others are created to take its place. This function is a C-language macro for CreateCxObj() , defined in . INPUTS ie - the input event list used as replacement by the translator RESULTS translatorObj - a pointer to the translator object, or NULL if it could not be created.
