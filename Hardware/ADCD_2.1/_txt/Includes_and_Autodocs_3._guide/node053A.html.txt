TITLE: realtime.library/SetConductorState

realtime.library/SetConductorState ]" border=0> NAME SetConductorState -- change the play state of a player's conductor. (V37) SYNOPSIS result = SetConductorState(player, state, time); D0 A0 D0 D1 LONG SetConductorState(struct Player *, ULONG, LONG); FUNCTION Changes the play state of the conductor referenced by the player. The states can be CONDSTATE_STOPPED, CONDSTATE_PAUSED, CONDSTATE_LOCATE, CONDSTATE_RUNNING, or the special value CONDSTATE_METRIC which asks the highest priority conducted node to do a CONDSTATE_LOCATE, or the special value CONDSTATE_SHUTTLE which informs the players that the clock value is changing, but the clock isn't actually running. Note that going from CONDSTATE_PAUSED to CONDSTATE_RUNNING does not reset the cdt_ClockTime of the conductor. INPUTS player - player referencing the conductor to change state - new play state of conductor time - start time offset in realtime.library heartbeat units RESULTS result - 0 if everything went OK, or a realtime.library error code if an error occured. These currently include RTE_PLAYING and RTE_NOCONDUCTOR. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
