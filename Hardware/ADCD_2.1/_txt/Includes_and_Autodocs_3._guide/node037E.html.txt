iffparse.library/StoreLocalItem ]" border=0> NAME StoreLocalItem -- insert a local context item into the context stack. (V36) SYNOPSIS error = StoreLocalItem(iff, localItem, position); D0 A0 A1 D0 LONG StoreLocalItem(struct IFFHandle *, struct LocalContextItem *, LONG); FUNCTION Adds the local context item to the list of items for one of the context nodes on the context stack and purges any other item in the same context with the same ident, type and id. The position argument determines where in the stack to add the item: IFFSLI_ROOT: Add item to list at root (default) stack position. IFFSLI_TOP: Add item to the top (current) context node. IFFSLI_PROP: Add element in top property context. Top property context is either the top FORM chunk, or the top LIST chunk, whichever is closer to the top of the stack. Items added to the root context, or added to the top context before the IFFHandle has been opened or after it has been closed, are put in the default context. That is, they will be the local items found only after all other context nodes have been searched. Items in the default context are also immune to being purged until the IFFHandle structure itself is deleted with FreeIFF() . This means that handlers installed in the root context will still be there after an IFFHandle structure has been opened and closed. (Note that this implies that items stored in a higher context will be deleted when that context ends.) INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle structure. localItem - pointer to LocalContextItem struct to insert. position - where to store the item (IFFSLI_ROOT, _TOP or _PROP). RESULT error - 0 if successful or an IFFERR_#? error code if unsuccessful. SEE ALSO FindLocalItem() , StoreItemInContext() , EntryHandler() , ExitHandler() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
