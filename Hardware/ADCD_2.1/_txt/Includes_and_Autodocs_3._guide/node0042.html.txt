amiga.lib/InvertString ]" border=0> NAME InvertString -- produce input events that would generate the given string. (V36) SYNOPSIS events = InvertString(str,km) struct InputEvent *InvertString(STRPTR,struct KeyMap *); FUNCTION This function returns a linked list of input events which would translate into the string using the supplied keymap (or the system default keymap if 'km' is NULL). 'str' is null-terminated and may contain: - ANSI character codes - backslash escaped characters: n - CR r - CR t - TAB 0 - illegal, do not use! \ - backslash - a text description of an input event as used by ParseIX() , enclosed in angle brackets. An example is: abc nhi there. INPUTS str - null-terminated string to convert to input events km - keymap to use for the conversion, or NULL to use the default keymap. RESULTS events - a chain of input events, or NULL if there was a problem. The most likely cause of failure is an illegal description enclosed in angled brackets. This chain should eventually be freed using FreeIEvents() . SEE ALSO commodities.library/ParseIX() , FreeIEvents() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
