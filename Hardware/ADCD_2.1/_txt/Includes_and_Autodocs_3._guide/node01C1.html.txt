Each piece is copied into the buffer, truncating at size-1 characters. The new position is then returned so that it may be passed in to the next call to splitname. If the separator is not found within 'size' characters, then size-1 characters plus a null will be put into the buffer, and the position of the next separator will be returned. If a a separator cannot be found, -1 is returned (but the characters from the old position to the end of the string are copied into the buffer, up to a maximum of size-1 characters). Both strings are null-terminated. This function is mainly intended to support handlers. INPUTS name - Filename being parsed. separator - Separator charactor to split by. buf - Buffer to hold separated name. oldpos - Current position in the file. size - Size of buf in bytes (including null termination). RESULT newpos - New position for next call to splitname. -1 for last one. BUGS In V36 and V37, path portions greater than or equal to 'size' caused the last character of the portion to be lost when followed by a separator. Fixed for V39 dos. For V36 and V37, the suggested work- around is to call SplitName() with a buffer one larger than normal (for example, 32 bytes), and then set buf[size-2] to '0' (for example, buf[30] = '0';).
