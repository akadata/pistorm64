intuition.library/ViewPortAddress ]" border=0> NAME ViewPortAddress -- Return the address of a window's viewport. SYNOPSIS ViewPort = ViewPortAddress( Window ) D0 A0 struct ViewPort *ViewPortAddress( struct Window * ); FUNCTION Returns the address of the viewport associated with the specified window. The viewport is actually the viewport of the screen within which the window is displayed. If you want to use any of the graphics, text, or animation primitives in your window and that primitive requires a pointer to a viewport, you can use this call. This pointer is only valid as long as your window's screen remains open, which is ensured by keeping your window open. INPUTS Window = pointer to the window for which you want the viewport address RESULT Returns the address of the Intuition ViewPort structure for your window's screen . BUGS This routine is unnecessary: you can just use the expression &Window->WScreen->ViewPort. SEE ALSO graphics.library [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
