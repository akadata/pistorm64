lowlevel.library/AddVBlankInt ]" border=0> NAME AddVBlankInt -- adds a routine executed every vertical blank. (V40) SYNOPSIS intHandle = AddVBlankInt(intRoutine, intData); D0 a0 a1 APTR AddVBlankInt(APTR, APTR); FUNCTION Lets you attach a routine to the system which will get called everytime a vertical blanking interrupt occurs. The routine is called from within an interrupt, so normal restrictions apply. The routine must preserve the following registers: A2, A3, A4, A7, D2-D7. Other registers are scratch, except for D0, which MUST BE SET TO 0 upon exit. On entry to the routine, A1 holds 'intData' and A5 holds 'intRoutine'. If your program is to exit without reboot, you MUST call RemVBlankInt() before exiting. Only one interrupt routine may be added to the system. ALWAYS check the return value in case some other task has previously used this function. INPUTS intRoutine - the routine to invoke every vblank. This routine should be as short as possible to minimize its effect on overall system performance. intData - data passed to the routine in register A1. If more than one long word of data is required this should be a pointer to a structure that contains the required data. RESULT intHandle - a handle used to manipulate the interrupt, or NULL if it was not possible to attach the routine. SEE ALSO RemVBlankInt() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
