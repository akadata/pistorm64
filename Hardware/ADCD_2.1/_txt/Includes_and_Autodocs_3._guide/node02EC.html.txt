SYNOPSIS Sprite_Number = GetSprite( sprite, pick ) d0 a0 d0 WORD GetSprite( struct SimpleSprite *, WORD ); FUNCTION Attempt to allocate one of the eight sprites for private use with the simple sprite manager. This must be done before using further calls to the simple sprite machine. If the programmer wants to use 15 color sprites, they must allocate both sprites and set the 'SPRITE_ATTACHED' bit in the odd sprite's posctldata array. INPUTS sprite - ptr to programmers SimpleSprite structure. pick - number in the range of 0-7 or -1 if programmer just wants the next one. RESULTS If pick is 0-7 attempt to allocate the sprite. If the sprite is already allocated then return -1. If pick -1 allocate the next sprite starting search at 0. If no sprites are available return -1 and fill -1 in num entry of SimpleSprite structure. If the sprite is available for allocation, mark it allocated and fill in the 'num' entry of the SimpleSprite structure. If successful return the sprite number.
