card.resource/DeviceTuple ]" border=0> NAME DeviceTuple -- Decode a device tuple SYNOPSIS return=DeviceTuple( tuple_data, storage) a0 a1 ULONG DeviceTuple( UBYTE *, struct DeviceTData *); FUNCTION Extracts SIZE, TYPE, and SPEED from a device tuple (generally obtained with CopyTuple() ). INPUTS tuple_data - Pointer to a CISTPL_DEVICE tuple (generally obtained with CopyTuple() ). storage - Pointer to a DeviceTData structure in which results are to be stored. struct DeviceTData { ULONG dtd_DTsize; /* Size of card (bytes) */ ULONG dtd_DTspeed; /* Speed in nanoseconds */ UBYTE dtd_DTtype; /* Type of card */ UBYTE dtd_DTflags; /* Other flags */ }; RETURN SIZE (same as dtd_DTsize) if the Device Tuple could be decoded. FALSE (0) if the tuple is believed to be invalid. The tuple is considered to be invalid if: The tuple link value is 0. The device type/speed byte is $00, or $FF. The device type is DTYPE_EXTEND, which is undefined as of this writing. The extended speed byte is a value which is undefined as of this writing. The extended speed byte is extended again which is undefined as of this writing. The device Size byte is $FF. NOTES Some cards may not have a size specified in the device tuple. An example would be an I/O card. The size would be returned as one (1) in this case. You should not call this function with a partial CISTPL_DEVICE tuple, or the return values may be junk.
