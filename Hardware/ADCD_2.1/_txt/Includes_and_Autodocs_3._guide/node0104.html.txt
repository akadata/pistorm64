TITLE: console.device/RawKeyConvert

console.device/RawKeyConvert ]" border=0> NAME RawKeyConvert -- decode raw input classes SYNOPSIS actual = RawKeyConvert(event, buffer, length, keyMap) D0 A0 A1 D1 A2 ConsoleDevice in A6 if called from Assembly Language. FUNCTION This console function converts input events of type IECLASS_RAWKEY to ANSI bytes, based on the keyMap, and places the result into the buffer. INPUTS event - an InputEvent structure pointer. buffer - a byte buffer large enough to hold all anticipated characters generated by this conversion. length - maximum anticipation, i.e. the buffer size in bytes. keyMap - a KeyMap structure pointer, or null if the default console device key map is to be used. RESULTS actual - the number of characters in the buffer, or -1 if a buffer overflow was about to occur. ERRORS if actual is -1, a buffer overflow condition was detected. Not all of the characters in the buffer are valid. NOTES This function is different from standard device commands in that it is a function in the console device library vectors. In order to obtain a valid library base pointer for the console device (a.k.a. ConsoleDevice) call OpenDevice("console.device", -1, IOStdReq , 0), and then grab the io_Device pointer field out of the IOStdReq and use as ConsoleDevice.
