workbench.library/RemoveAppWindow ]" border=0> NAME RemoveAppWindow - remove a window from Workbench's list (V36) of AppWindows. SYNOPSIS success = RemoveAppWindow(AppWindow) D0 A0 BOOL RemoveAppWindow(struct AppWindow *); FUNCTION Attempt to remove an appwindow from Workbench's list of AppWindows. INPUTS AppWindow - pointer to an AppWindow structure returned by AddAppWindow. RESULTS success - TRUE if the window could be removed, FALSE otherwise. NOTES As with anything that deals with asynchronous operation, you will need to do a final check for messages on your AppMessage port for messages that may have come in between the last time you checked and the call to removed the AppWindow . Before the AppWindow is removed, all its drop zones will be removed first. There is no need for you to call RemoveAppWindowDropZone() for every single one.
