(V36) SYNOPSIS actual = ReadChunkBytes(iff, buf, numBytes); D0 A0 A1 D0 LONG ReadChunkBytes(struct IFFHandle *, APTR buf, LONG); FUNCTION Reads the IFFHandle stream into the buffer for the specified number of bytes. Reads are limited to the size of the current chunk and attempts to read past the end of the chunk will truncate. This function returns positive number of bytes read or a negative error code.

RESULT actual - (positive) number of bytes read if successful or a (negative) IFFERR_#? error code if unsuccessful.
