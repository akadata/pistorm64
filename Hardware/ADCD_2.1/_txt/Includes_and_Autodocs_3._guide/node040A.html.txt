FUNCTION Add a function to the list of functions called to clean up before a hard reset generated at the keyboard. The reset handler is called as: ResetHandler(handlerData) a1 IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort set io_Device preset by OpenDevice io_Unit preset by OpenDevice io_Command KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER io_Data a pointer to an interrupt structure. is_Data the handlerData pointer described above is_Code the Handler function address NOTES Few of the Amiga keyboard models generate the communication codes used to implement this reset processing. Specifically, only the Euro a1000 (rare), and the B2000 keyboard generate them. The interrupt structure is kept by the keyboard device until a RemResetHandler command is satisfied for it, but the KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER command itself is replied immediately.
