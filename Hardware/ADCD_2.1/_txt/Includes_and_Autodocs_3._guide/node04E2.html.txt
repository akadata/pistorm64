(V40) SYNOPSIS error = StoreNV(appName, itemName, data, length, killRequesters); D0 A0 A1 A2 D0 D1 UWORD StoreNV(STRPTR, STRPTR , APTR , ULONG, BOOL); FUNCTION Saves some data in nonvolatile storage. The data is tagged with AppName and ItemName so it can be retrieved later. No single item should be larger than one fourth of the maximum storage as returned by GetNVInfo() . There is no data compression associated with this function. The strings, AppName and ItemName, should be short, but descriptive. They need to be short since the string is stored with the data and the nonvolatile storage for a stand alone game system is limited. The game system allows the user to selectively remove entries from storage, so the string should be desriptive. The strings AppName and ItemName may not contain the '/' or ':' characters. It is recommended that these characters be blocked from user input when requesting AppName and ItemName strings. INPUTS appName - NULL terminated string identifying the application creating the data. Maximum length is 31. itemName - NULL terminated string uniquely identifying the data within the application. Maximum length is 31. data - pointer to the memory block to be stored. length - number of bytes to be stored in the units of tens of bytes. For example, if you have 23 bytes to store length = 3; 147 byte then length = 15. killRequesters - suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system requesters are to be suppressed during this function. FALSE if system requesters are allowed. RESULT error - 0 means no error, NVERR_BADNAME error in AppName, or ItemName. NVERR_WRITEPROT Nonvolatile storage is read only. NVERR_FAIL Failure in writing data (nonvolatile storage full, or write protected). NVERR_FATAL Fatal error when accessing nonvolatile storage, possible loss of previously saved nonvolatile data. SEE ALSO GetCopyNV() , GetNVInfo() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
