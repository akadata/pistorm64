bevel_ic/--styleguide-- ]" border=0> BEVEL STYLE Several ReAction objects allow overriding the default bevel style. This is NOT recommended practice for application authors. But instead, its provided to add some extra flexability to BOOPSI class authors who may wish to sub-class a ReAction gadget or utilize it within a larger composite (model class) object. When using bevel.image directly be sure to select the appropriate bevel for your usage. Do not provide a bevel style override tag unless it makes sence to do so. The idea being that all applications and BOOPSI objects should be presented using a standard beveling style. For example, a button gadget using a BVS_FIELD string bevel would be an illogical choice. Any button should use BVS_BUTTON, a text entry field should use BVS_FIELD, and ofcourse a layout group, if using a bevel, should use BVS_GROUP, BVS_SBAR_VERT or BVS_SBAR_HORIZ.
