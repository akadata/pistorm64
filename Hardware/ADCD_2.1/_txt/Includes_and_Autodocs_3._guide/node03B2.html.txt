(V36) SYNOPSIS FreeScreenDrawInfo( Screen , DrInfo ) A0 A1 VOID FreeScreenDrawInfo( struct Screen *, struct DrawInfo * ); FUNCTION Declares that you are finished with the DrawInfo structure returned by GetScreenDrawInfo() . INPUTS Screen - pointer to screen passed to GetScreenDrawInfo() . DrInfo - pointer to DrawInfo returned by GetScreenDrawInfo() . A NULL DrawInfo pointer is a valid parameter, signifying "do nothing". RESULT None NOTES This function, and GetScreenDrawInfo() , don't really do much, but they provide an upward compatibility path. That means that if you misuse them today, they probably won't cause a problem, although they may someday later. So, please be very careful only to use the DrawInfo structure between calls to GetScreenDrawInfo() and FreeScreenDrawInfo(), and be sure that you don't forget FreeScreenDrawInfo().
