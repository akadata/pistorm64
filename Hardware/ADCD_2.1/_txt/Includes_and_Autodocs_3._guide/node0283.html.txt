gadtools.library/GT_ReplyIMsg ]" border=0> NAME GT_ReplyIMsg -- reply a message obtained with GT_GetIMsg() . (V36) SYNOPSIS GT_ReplyIMsg(imsg) A1 VOID GT_ReplyIMsg(struct IntuiMessage *); FUNCTION Reply a modified IntuiMessage obtained with GT_GetIMsg() . If you use GT_GetIMsg() , use this function where you would normally have used exec.library/ReplyMsg() . You may safely call this routine with a NULL pointer (nothing will be done). INPUTS imsg - a modified IntuiMessage obtained with GT_GetIMsg() , or NULL in which case this function does nothing NOTES When using GadTools, you MUST explicitly GT_ReplyIMsg() all messages you receive. You cannot depend on CloseWindow() to handle messages you have not replied. Starting with V39, this function actually expects a pointer to an ExtIntuiMessage structure, but the prototype was not changed for source code compatibility with older software.
