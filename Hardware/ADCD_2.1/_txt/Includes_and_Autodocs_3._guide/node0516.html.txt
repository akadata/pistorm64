printer.device/PRead ]" border=0> NAME PRead - internal read from printer port SYNOPSIS error = (*PrinterData->pd_PRead)(buffer, length, tv); D0 LONG PRead(UBYTE *, ULONG *, struct timeval *); FUNCTION PRead reads a buffer of data from the printer port. The variable length points to is set to the actual number of read bytes. tv points to a struct timeval or is NULL in which case the default time is PrinterExtendedData.ped_TimeoutSecs. If the time of tv ellapes before the CMD_READ at the printer port is done two different things may happen: If at least one char is read PRead() returns. If no char is read but PQuery returns a value larger 0 the read is repeated with that length to read all outstanding data. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
