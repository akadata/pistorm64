exec.library/SetSignal ]" border=0> NAME SetSignal -- define the state of this task's signals SYNOPSIS oldSignals = SetSignal(newSignals, signalMask) D0 D0 D1 ULONG SetSignal(ULONG,ULONG); FUNCTION This function can query or modify the state of the current task's received signal mask. Setting the state of signals is considered dangerous. Reading the state of signals is safe. INPUTS newSignals - the new values for the signals specified in signalSet. signalMask - the set of signals to be affected. RESULTS oldSignals - the prior values for all signals EXAMPLES Get the current state of all signals: SetSignal(0L,0L); Clear the CTRL-C signal: SetSignal(0L,SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C); Check if the CTRL-C signal was pressed: #include /* Check & clear CTRL_C signal */ if(SetSignal(0L,SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C) & SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C) { printf("CTRL-C pressed!n"); } SEE ALSO Signal() , Wait() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
