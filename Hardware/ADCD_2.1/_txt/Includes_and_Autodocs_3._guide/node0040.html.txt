amiga.lib/HookEntry ]" border=0> NAME HookEntry -- Assembler to HLL conversion stub for hook entry. SYNOPSIS result = HookEntry( struct Hook *, Object *, APTR ) D0 A0 A2 A1 FUNCTION By definition, a standard hook entry-point must receive the hook in A0, the object in A2, and the message in A1. If your hook entry-point is written in a high-level language and is expecting its parameters on the stack, then HookEntry() will put the three parameters on the stack and invoke the function stored in the hook h_SubEntry field. This function is only useful to hook implementers, and is never called from C. INPUTS hook - pointer to hook being invoked object - pointer to hook-specific data msg - pointer to hook-specific message RESULT result - a hook-specific result. NOTES This function first appeared in the V37 release of amiga.lib. However, it does not depend on any particular version of the OS, and works fine even in V34. EXAMPLE If your hook dispatcher is this: dispatch( struct Hook *hookPtr, Object *obj, APTR msg ) { ... } Then when you initialize your hook, you would say: myhook.h_Entry = HookEntry; /* amiga.lib stub */ myhook.h_SubEntry = dispatch; /* HLL entry */ SEE ALSO CallHook() , CallHookA() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
