You took a Card Removed interrupt while you owned the credit-card. If so, you MUST call this function, else no other task will be notified of newly inserted cards. On some machines the credit-card interface hardware may also be left disabled until you respond to the card removed interrupt by calling this function. You want to remove yourself from the notification list (see optional flags below). INPUTS handle - Same handle as that used when OwnCard() was called. flags - Optional flags. - CARDB_REMOVEHANDLE means you want remove your CardHandle structure from the notification list whether or not you currently own the credit-card in the card slot. The node structure in your CardHandle will be removed from the notification list, and ownership will be released if you were the owner of the card.
