dos.library/Delay ]" border=0> NAME Delay -- Delay a process for a specified time SYNOPSIS Delay( ticks ) D1 void Delay(ULONG) FUNCTION The argument 'ticks' specifies how many ticks (50 per second) to wait before returning control. INPUTS ticks - integer BUGS Due to a bug in the timer.device in V1.2/V1.3, specifying a timeout of zero for Delay() can cause the unreliable timer & floppy disk operation. This is fixed in V36 and later. SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
