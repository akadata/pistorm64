workbench.library/MakeWorkbenchObjectVisibleArary/MakeWorkbenchObjectVisibleA ]" border=0> NAME MakeWorkbenchObjectVisibleA -- Change a Workbench window in such a way as to make a particular icon visible. (V44) SYNOPSIS success = MakeWorkbenchObjectVisibleA(name,tags) D0 A0 A1 BOOL MakeWorkbenchObjectVisibleA(STRPTR name,struct TagItem *tags); success = MakeWorkbenchObjectVisible(name,...); BOOL MakeWorkbenchObjectVisible(STRPTR name,...); FUNCTION Due to how the scrollers of a Workbench window affect the positions of the icons inside that window, some icons may not be drawn inside the bounds of the window. By using MakeWorkbenchObjectVisibleA() the window scrollers can be made to scroll such a "hidden" icon into view. INPUTS name -- Name of the icon to make visible. Note that the window the icon resides in must already be open. tags -- Additional options. TAGS No tags are defined yet (V44). RESULTS result -- FALSE if the icon in question could not be found, TRUE otherwise. If FALSE is returned, you can query the error code using dos.library/IoErr() . EXAMPLE /* Make the icon for the drawer "SYS:" visible. */ MakeWorkbenchObjectVisible("SYS:",TAG_END); NOTES The name of the icon to make visible is interpreted relative to the current directory of the program to call MakeWorkbenchObjectVisibleA(). For this function call to succeed, Workbench must be open. This means that the LoadWB command was executed and the Workbench screen has been opened. While the user is dragging icons, no on-screen rendering may take place. In this state Workbench may refuse to execute the MakeWorkbenchObjectVisible() call and return an error code instead (ERROR_OBJECT_IN_USE). SEE ALSO dos.library/IoErr [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
