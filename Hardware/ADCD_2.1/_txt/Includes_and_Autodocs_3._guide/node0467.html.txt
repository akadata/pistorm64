lowlevel.library/QueryKeys ]" border=0> NAME QueryKeys -- return the states for a set of keys. (V40) SYNOPSIS QueryKeys(queryArray, arraySize); A0 D1 VOID QueryKeys(struct KeyQuery *, UBYTE); FUNCTION Scans the keyboard to determine which of the rawkey codes listed in the QueryArray are currently pressed. The state for each key is returned in the array. This function may be invoked from within an interrupt, but the size of QueryArray should be kept as small as possible. This is a low level function that does not fit the normal Amiga multitasking model. The values returned have no knowledge of which window/screen currently has input focus. INPUTS queryArray - an array of KeyQuery structures. The kq_KeyCode fields of these structures should be filled with the rawkey codes you wish to query about. Upon return from this function, the kq_Pressed field of these structures will be set to TRUE if the associated key is down, and FALSE if not. arraySize - number of key code entries in queryArray SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
