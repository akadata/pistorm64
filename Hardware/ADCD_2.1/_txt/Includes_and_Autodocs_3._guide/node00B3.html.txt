cd.device/CD_READXL ]" border=0> NAME CD_READXL -- Read from CD-ROM into memory via transfer list. IO REQUEST io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command CD_READXL io_Data pointer to transfer list (i.e. struct List *). io_Length maximum transfer length (WORD multiple) or 0. io_Offset byte offset from the start of the disk describing where to read data from, must be a WORD multiple. RESULTS io_Error 0 for success, or an error code as described in io_Actual if io_Error is 0, number of bytes actually transferred FUNCTION This command starts reading data off the disk at the specified location and deposits it into memory according to the nodes in a transfer list. The pointer to the list of transfer nodes is placed in io_Data. If you have a non-circular transfer list, simply set io_Length to 0 (0 is special and means ignore io_Length) -- your transfer will end when your transfer list has been exhausted. If you have a circular transfer list, the list will never end. In this case, the transfer will terminate when io_Length bytes have been transferred. The fields in the CDXL node structure are: struct CDXL { struct MinNode Node; /* double linkage */ char *Buffer; /* data destination */ LONG Length; /* must be even # bytes */ LONG Actual; /* bytes transferred */ APTR IntData; /* interrupt server data segment */ VOID (*IntCode)(); /* interrupt server code entry */ }; The philosophy here is that you set up the buffers you want filled, create CDXL nodes describing the locations and sizes of these buffers, link all the nodes together in the order that you'd like (even make a circular list for animations), and execute the command. The data will be streamed into the appropriate buffers until the list has been exhausted, an entry with a Length of zero is encountered, io_Length bytes have been transferred (if io_Length is non-zero), or the command is aborted with AbortIO() . If you fill in the (*IntCode)() field with a pointer to an interrupt routine, your routine will be called when the transfer for the node is complete. Your code will be called before the driver proceeds to the next node. The interrupt should follow the same rules as standard interrupts (see AddIntServer of Exec autodocs). Register A2 will contain a pointer to the node just completed. You may manipulate the list from within the interrupt. Your code must be brief (this is an interrupt). When returning from this interrupt, D0 should be cleared and an RTS instruction should be used to return. Servers are called with the following register conventions: D0 - scratch D1 - scratch A0 - scratch A1 - server is_Data pointer (scratch) A2 - pointer to CDXL node just completed A5 - jump vector register (scratch) all other registers must be preserved EXAMPLE NOTES Try to make sure that small buffers are not overused. Each time a node is completed, an interrupt is generated. If you find that your computer is acting sluggish, or the CD_READXL command is aborting, you are probably generating too many interrupts. It is not efficient to have more than a few of these interrupts generated within a vertical blank. Unlike the READ command, the READXL command will not retry a sector if there is an error. Since the READXL command's purpose is primarily for animations, data streaming is considered more important than the data itself. An error will be returned in io_Error if a data error did occur. This command will never drop to a lower speed in the event of an error. BUGS SEE ALSO CMD_READ , CD_SEEK , Autodocs - AddIntServer [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
