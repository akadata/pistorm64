(V36) SYNOPSIS ResultFlags = PubScreenStatus( Screen , StatusFlags ) D0 A0 D0 UWORD PubScreenStatus( struct Screen *, UWORD ); FUNCTION Changes status flags for a given public screen. The only flag bit currently defined is PSNF_PRIVATE. Thus, PubScreenStatus( screen, PSNF_PRIVATE ) makes a screen private, while PubScreenStatus( screen, 0 ) makes it public. Do not apply this function to a screen if your program isn't the screen's "owner", in particular, don't call this function for the Workbench screen. INPUTS Screen = pointer to public screen StatusFlags = Any of the PSNF_ flags (only PSNF_PRIVATE is currently defined). RESULT Returns 0 in the lowest order bit of the return value if the screen wasn't public, or because it can not be taken private because visitors are open in it. All other bits in the return code are reserved for future enhancement. BUGS SEE ALSO OpenScreen() , Intuition V36 update documentation [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
