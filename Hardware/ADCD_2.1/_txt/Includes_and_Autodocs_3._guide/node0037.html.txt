amiga.lib/DeleteTask ]" border=0> NAME DeleteTask -- delete a task created with CreateTask() SYNOPSIS DeleteTask(task) VOID DeleteTask(struct Task *); FUNCTION This function simply calls exec.library/RemTask() , deleting a task from the Exec task lists and automatically freeing any stack and structure memory allocated for it by CreateTask() . Before deleting a task, you must first make sure that the task is not currently executing any system code which might try to signal the task after it is gone. This can be accomplished by stopping all sources that might reference the doomed task, then causing the subtask to execute a Wait(0L). Another option is to have the task call DeleteTask()/RemTask() on itself. INPUTS task - task to remove from the system NOTE This function simply calls exec.library/RemTask() , so you can call RemTask() directly instead of calling this function.
