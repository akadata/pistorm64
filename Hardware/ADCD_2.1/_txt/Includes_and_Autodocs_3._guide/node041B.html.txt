layers.library/CreateBehindLayer ]" border=0> NAME CreateBehindLayer -- Create a new layer behind all existing layers. SYNOPSIS result = CreateBehindLayer(li,bm,x0,y0,x1,y1,flags [,bm2]) d0 a0 a1 d0 d1 d2 d3 d4 [ a2 ] struct Layer *CreateBehindLayer(struct Layer_Info *, struct BitMap *, LONG , LONG , LONG , LONG , LONG , ... ); FUNCTION Create a new Layer of position and size (x0,y0)->(x1,y1) Make this layer of type found in flags. If SuperBitMap, use bm2 as pointer to real SuperBitMap, and copy contents of Superbitmap into display layer. If this layer is a backdrop layer then place it behind all other layers including other backdrop layers. If this is not a backdrop layer then place it behind all nonbackdrop layers. Note: when using SUPERBITMAP, you should also set LAYERSMART flag. INPUTS li - pointer to LayerInfo structure bm - pointer to common BitMap used by all Layers x0,y0 - upper left hand corner of layer x1,y1 - lower right hand corner of layer flags - various types of layers supported as bit sets. (for bit definitions, see graphics/layers.h ) bm2 - pointer to optional Super BitMap RESULTS result - pointer to Layer structure if successful NULL if not successful BUGS SEE ALSO DeleteLayer() , graphics/layers.h , graphics/clip.h , graphics/gfx.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
