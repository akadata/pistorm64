TITLE: serial.device/CMD_READ

serial.device/CMD_READ ]" border=0> NAME Read -- read input from serial port FUNCTION This command causes a stream of characters to be read in from the serial port buffer. The number of characters is specified in io_Length. The Query function can be used to check how many characters are currently waiting in the serial port buffer. If more characters are requested than are currently available, the ioRequest will be queued until it can be satisfied. The best way to handle reads is to first Query to get the number of characters currently in the buffer. Then post a read request for that number of characters (or the maximum size of your buffer). If zero characters are in the buffer, post a request for 1 character. When at least one is ready, the device will return it. Now start over with another Query. Before the program exits, it must be sure to AbortIO() then WaitIO() any outstanding ioRequests. IO REQUEST io_Message A mn_ReplyPort is required io_Device set by OpenDevice io_Unit set by OpenDevice io_Command CMD_READ io_Flags If the IOB_QUICK bit is set, read will try to complete the IO quickly io_Length number of characters to receive. io_Data pointer to buffer RESULTS Error -- if the Read succeded, then io_Error will be null. If the Read failed, then io_Error will be non-zero. io_Error will indicate problems such as parity mismatch, break, and buffer overrun. SEE ALSO serial.device/SDCMD_QUERY serial.device/SDCMD_SETPARAMS BUGS Having multiple outstanding read IORequests at any one time will probably fail. Old documentation mentioned a mode where io_Length was set to -1. If you want a NULL terminated read, use the io_TermArray instead. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
