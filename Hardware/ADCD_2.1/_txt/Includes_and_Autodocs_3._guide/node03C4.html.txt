intuition.library/MakeScreen ]" border=0> NAME MakeScreen -- Do an Intuition-integrated MakeVPort() of a screen. SYNOPSIS failure = MakeScreen( Screen ) D0 (V39) A0 LONG MakeScreen( struct Screen * ); /* Returns LONG in V39 and greater */ FUNCTION This procedure allows you to do a MakeVPort() for the viewport of your custom screen in an Intuition-integrated way. This way you can do your own screen manipulations without worrying about interference with Intuition's usage of the same viewport. The operation of this function is as follows: - Block until the Intuition View structure is not in being changed. - Set the view modes correctly to reflect if there is a (visible) interlaced screen. - call MakeVPort() , passing the Intuition View and your screen's ViewPort . - Unlocks the Intuition View . After calling this routine, you should call RethinkDisplay() to incorporate the new viewport of your custom screen into the Intuition display. NOTE: Intuition may determine that because of a change in global interlace needs that all viewports need to be remade, so it may effectively call RemakeDisplay() . INPUTS Screen = address of the custom screen structure RESULT Starting with V39, returns zero for success, non-zero for failure. Probable cause of failure is failure of graphics.library/MakeVPort() . Prior to V39, the return code is invalid. Do not interpret it when running on pre-V39 systems!
