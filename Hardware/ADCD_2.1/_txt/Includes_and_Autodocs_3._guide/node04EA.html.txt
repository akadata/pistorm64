palette_gc/--styleguide-- ]" border=0> PALETTE STYLE The usability of a palette gadget decreases as the number of colours it is displaying increases. If there is a possibility that your palette gadget may be displaying a large number of colours (say, greater than 16), you should provide a means to simplify the colour selection. Two possibilities would be to divide your colour palette into banks, and have users switch banks via a chooser gadget for example. Another possibility would be to attach a scroller gadget to allow the user to scroll through the available colours, displaying just a subset of them on screen at a time. You may also want to sort your colours in some logical manner and use PALETTE_ColourTable. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
