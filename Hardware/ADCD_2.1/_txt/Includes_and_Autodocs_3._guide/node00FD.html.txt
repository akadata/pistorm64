console.device/CD_SETDEFAULTKEYMAP ]" border=0> NAME CD_SETDEFAULTKEYMAP -- set the current default keymap FUNCTION This console command copies/uses the keyMap structure pointed to by io_Data to the console device default keymap, which is used to initialize console units when opened, and by RawKeyConvert with a null keyMap parameter. IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice io_Command CD_SETDEFAULTKEYMAP io_Flags IOF_QUICK if quick I/O possible, else zero io_Length sizeof(*keyMap) io_Data struct KeyMap *keyMap pointer to a structure that describes the raw keycode to byte stream conversion. RESULTS This function sets the io_Error field in the IOStdReq , and fills the current device default key map from the structure pointed to by io_Data. BUGS As of V36, this command no longer copies the keymap structure, and the keymap must remain in memory until the default key map is changed. In general there is no reason for applications to use this command. The default key map will generally be set by the user using a system provided command/tool.
