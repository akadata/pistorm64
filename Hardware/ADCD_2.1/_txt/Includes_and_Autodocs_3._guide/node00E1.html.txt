(V36) SYNOPSIS AddIEvents(events) A0 VOID AddIEvents(struct InputEvent *); FUNCTION This function adds a null-terminated linked list of input events to the input stream processed by commodities. It is a touch easier than using the input device directly. The contents of the input events are copied into commodity messages, so they may be disposed of as soon as this call returns. The messages are initially routed to the first broker in commodities' object list. INPUTS events - the list of input events to add (may be NULL) WARNING The cx_lib/InvertString() function creates lists of input events that are in reverse order. Thus, passing the result of InvertString() to this function will insert a series of input events that will generate a string that's a mirror image of the string passed to InvertString() originally. The solution to the above is to either flip the string before passing it to InvertString() , or flip the resulting list of input events. BUGS Prior to V40, this function did not copy the data pointed to by ie_EventAddress for any events of type IECLASS_NEWPOINTERPOS. SEE ALSO cx_lib/FreeIEvents() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
