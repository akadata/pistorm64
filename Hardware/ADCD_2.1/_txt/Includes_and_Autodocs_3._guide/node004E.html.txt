TITLE: amiga.lib/stdio

amiga.lib/stdio ]" border=0> NAMES fclose - close a file fgetc - get a character from a file fprintf - format data to file (see printf() ) fputc - put character to file fputs - write string to file getchar - get a character from stdin printf - put format data to stdout (see exec.library/RawDoFmt) putchar - put character to stdout puts - put string to stdout, followed by newline FUNCTION These functions work much like the standard C functions of the same names. The file I/O functions all use non-buffered AmigaDOS files, and must not be mixed with the file I/O of any C compiler. The names of these functions match those found in many standard C libraries, when a name conflict occurs, the function is generally taken from the FIRST library that was specified on the linker's command line. Thus to use these functions, specify the amiga.lib library first. To get a suitable AmigaDOS FileHandle , the dos.library/Open() or dos.library/Output() functions must be used. All of the functions that write to stdout expect an appropriate FileHandle to have been set up ahead of time. Depending on your C compiler and options, this may have been done by the startup code. Or it can be done manually From C: extern ULONG stdout; /* Remove the extern if startup code did not define stdout */ stdout=Output(); From assembly: XDEF _stdout DC.L _stdout ; dos.library/Output() here.
