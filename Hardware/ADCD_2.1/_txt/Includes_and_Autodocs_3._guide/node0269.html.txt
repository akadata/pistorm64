This routine knows how to detect whether or not there is actually a board there, In addition, the ROM portion of a new style expansion board is encoded in ones-complement format (except for the first two nybbles -- the er_Type field). ReadExpansionRom knows about this and un-complements the appropriate fields. INPUTS board - a pointer to the base of a new style expansion board. configDev - the ConfigDev structure that will be read in. offset - a logical offset from the configdev base RESULTS error - If the board address does not contain a valid new style expansion board, then error will be non-zero. EXAMPLES configDev = AllocConfigDev(); if( ! configDev ) panic(); error = ReadExpansionBoard( board, configDev ); if( ! error ) { configDev->cd_BoardAddr = board; ConfigBoard( configDev ); } SEE ALSO ReadExpansionByte() , WriteExpansionByte() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
