(V36) SYNOPSIS actual = ReadChunkRecords(iff, buf, bytesPerRecord, numRecords); D0 A0 A1 D0 D1 LONG ReadChunkRecords(struct IFFHandle *, APTR , LONG , LONG); FUNCTION Reads records from the current chunk into buffer.

INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle structure. buf - pointer to buffer area to receive data. bytesPerRecord - size of data records to read. numRecords - number of data records to read. RESULT actual - (positive) number of whole records read if successful or a (negative) IFFERR_#? error code if unsuccessful.
