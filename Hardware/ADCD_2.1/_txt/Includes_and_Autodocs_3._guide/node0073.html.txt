audio.device/OpenDevice ]" border=0> NAME OpenDevice - open the audio device SYNOPSIS error = OpenDevice("audio.device", unitNumber, iORequest, flags); FUNCTION The OpenDevice routine grants access to the audio device. It takes an I/O audio request block (iORequest) and if it can successfully open the audio device, it loads the device pointer (io_Device) and the allocation key (ioa_AllocKey); otherwise, it returns an error (IOERR_OPENFAIL). OpenDevice increments the open count keeping the device from being expunged (Expunge). If the length (ioa_Length) is non-zero, OpenDevice tries to allocate (ADCMD_ALLOCATE) audio channels from a array of channel combination options (ioa_Data). If the allocation succeeds, the allocated channel combination is loaded into the unit field (ioa_Unit); otherwise, OpenDevice returns an error (ADIOERR_ALLOCFAILED). OpenDevice does not wait for allocation to succeed and closes (CloseDevice) the audio device if it fails. To allocate channels, OpenDevice also requires a properly initialized reply port (mn_ReplyPort) with an allocated signal bit. INPUTS unitNumber- not used iORequest - pointer to audio request block (struct IOAudio) ln_Pri - allocation precedence (-128 thru 127), only necessary for allocation (non-zero length) mn_ReplyPort- pointer to message port for allocation, only necessary for allocation (non-zero length) ioa_AllocKey- allocation key; zero to generate new key. Otherwise, it must be set by (or copied from I/O block that is set by) previous OpenDevice function or ADCMD_ALLOCATE command (non-zero length) ioa_Data - pointer to channel combination options (byte array, bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3), only necessary for allocation (non-zero length) ioa_Length - length of the channel combination option array (0 thru 16), zero for no allocation flags - not used OUTPUTS iORequest - pointer to audio request block (struct IOAudio) io_Device - pointer to device node if OpenDevice succeeds, otherwise -1 io_Unit - bit map of successfully allocated channels (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Error - error number: 0 - no error IOERR_OPENFAIL - open failed ADIOERR_ALLOCFAILED - allocation failed, no open ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, set to a unique number if passed a zero and OpenDevice succeeds error - copy of io_Error [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
