parallel.device/PDCMD_SETPARAMS ]" border=0> NAME SetParams -- change parameters for the parallel device FUNCTION This command allows the caller to change the EOFMODE parameter for the parallel port device. It will disallow changes if any reads or writes are active or queued. The PARB_EOFMODE bit of io_ParFlags controlls whether the io_PTermArray is to be used as an additional termination criteria for reads and writes. It may be set directly without a call to SetParams, setting it here performs the additional service of copying the PTermArray into the device default array which is used as the initial array for subsequent device opens. The Shared bit can be changed here, and overrides the current device access mode set at OpenDevice time. IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort initialized io_Device preset by OpenDevice io_Unit preset by OpenDevice io_Command PDCMD_SETPARAMS (0A) NOTE that the following fields of your IORequest are filled by Open to reflect the parallel device's current configuration. io_PExtFlags must be set to zero, unless used io_ParFlags see definition in parallel.i or parallel.h NOTE that x00 yields exclusive access, PTermArray inactive. io_PTermArray ASCII descending-ordered 8-byte array of termination characters. If less than 8 chars used, fill out array w/lowest valid value. Terminators are used only if EOFMODE bit of io_Parflags is set. (e.g. x512F040303030303 ) This field is filled on OpenDevice only if the EOFMODE bit is set. RESULTS io_Error -- if the SetParams succeded, then io_Error will be null. if the SetParams failed, then io_Error will be non-zero. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
