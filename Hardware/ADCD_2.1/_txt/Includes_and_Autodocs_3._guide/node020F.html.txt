exec.library/FreePooled ]" border=0> NAME FreePooled -- Free pooled memory (V39) SYNOPSIS FreePooled(poolHeader,memory,memSize) a0 a1 d0 void FreePooled(void *,void *,ULONG); FUNCTION Deallocates memory allocated by AllocPooled() . The size of the allocation *MUST* match the size given to AllocPooled() . The reason the pool functions do not track individual allocation sizes is because many of the uses of pools have small allocation sizes and the tracking of the size would be a large overhead. Only memory allocated by AllocPooled() may be freed with this function! Doing a DeletePool() on the pool will free all of the puddles and thus all of the allocations done with AllocPooled() in that pool. (No need to FreePooled() each allocation) INPUTS memory - pointer to memory allocated by AllocPooled . poolHeader - a specific private pool header. NOTES The pool function do not protect an individual pool from multiple accesses. The reason is that in most cases the pools will be used by a single task. If your pool is going to be used by more than one task you must Semaphore protect the pool from having more than one task trying to allocate within the same pool at the same time. Warning: Forbid() protection *will not work* in the future. *Do NOT* assume that we will be able to make it work in the future. FreePooled() may well break a Forbid() and as such can only be protected by a semaphore. To track sizes yourself, the following code can be used: Assumes a6=ExecBase ; ; Function to do AllocVecPooled(Pool,memSize) ; AllocVecPooled: addq.l #4,d0 ; Get space for tracking move.l d0,-(sp) ; Save the size jsr _LVOAllocPooled(a6) ; Call pool... move.l (sp)+,d1 ; Get size back... tst.l d0 ; Check for error beq.s avp_fail ; If NULL, failed! move.l d0,a0 ; Get pointer... move.l d1,(a0)+ ; Store size move.l a0,d0 ; Get result avp_fail: rts ; return ; ; Function to do FreeVecPooled(pool,memory) ; FreeVecPooled: move.l -(a1),d0 ; Get size / ajust pointer jmp _LVOFreePooled(a6) SEE ALSO AllocPooled() , CreatePool() , DeletePool() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
