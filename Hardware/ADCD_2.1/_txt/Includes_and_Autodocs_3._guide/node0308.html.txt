graphics.library/OpenFont ]" border=0> NAME OpenFont -- Get a pointer to a system font. SYNOPSIS font = OpenFont(textAttr) D0 A0 struct TextFont *OpenFont(struct TextAttr *); FUNCTION This function searches the system font space for the graphics text font that best matches the attributes specified. The pointer to the font returned can be used in subsequent SetFont and CloseFont calls. It is important to match this call with a corresponding CloseFont call for effective management of ram fonts. INPUTS textAttr - a TextAttr or TTextAttr structure that describes the text font attributes desired. RESULT font is zero if the desired font cannot be found. If the named font is found, but the size and style specified are not available, a font with the nearest attributes is returned. BUGS Prior to V39 this function would return a TextFont pointer for any font which matched exactly in Y size, regardless of differences in DPI, or DotSize. As part of fixing this bug it is REQUIRED that you use pass the same TextAttr (or TTextAttr) to this function that was used when OpenDiskFont() was called. OpenFont(), and OpenDiskFont() use WeighTAMatch() to measure how well two fonts match. WeightTAMatch() was a public function in graphics.library V36-V37; it is now a system PRIVATE function as of V39.
