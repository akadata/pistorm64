gadtools.library/GT_GetIMsg ]" border=0> NAME GT_GetIMsg -- get an IntuiMessage , with GadTools processing. (V36) SYNOPSIS imsg = GT_GetIMsg(intuiport) D0 A0 struct IntuiMessage *GT_GetIMsg(struct MsgPort *); FUNCTION Use GT_GetIMsg() in place of the usual exec.library/GetMsg() when reading IntuiMessages from your window's UserPort. If needed, the GadTools dispatcher will be invoked, and suitable processing will be done for gadget actions. This function returns a pointer to a modified IntuiMessage (which is a copy of the original, possibly with some supplementary information from GadTools). If there are no messages (or if the only messages are meaningful only to GadTools, NULL will be returned. INPUTS intuiport - the Window->UserPort of a window that is using the Gadget Toolkit. RESULT imsg - pointer to modified IntuiMessage , or NULL if there are no applicable messages. NOTES Be sure to use GT_ReplyIMsg() and not exec.library/ReplyMsg() on messages obtained with GT_GetIMsg(). If you intend to do more with the resulting message than read its fields, act on it, and reply it, you may find GT_FilterIMsg() more appropriate. Starting with V39, this function actually returns a pointer to an ExtIntuiMessage structure, but the prototype was not changed for source code compatibility with older software.
