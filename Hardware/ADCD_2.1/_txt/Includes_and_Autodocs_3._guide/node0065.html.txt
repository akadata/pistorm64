audio.device/ADCMD_PERVOL ]" border=0> NAME ADCMD_PERVOL -- change the period and volume for writes in progress to audio channels FUNCTION ADCMD_PERVOL is a command for multiple audio channels. For each selected channel (io_Unit), if the allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) is correct and there is a write (CMD_WRITE) in progress, ADCMD_PERVOL loads a new volume and period immediately or at the end of the current cycle depending on the sync flag (ADIOF_SYNCCYCLE). If the allocation key in incorrect, ADCMD_PERVOL returns an error (ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION). ADCMD_PERVOL is synchronous and only replies (mn_ReplyPort) if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear. Do not use ADCMD_PERVOL in interrupt code at interrupt level 5 or higher. INPUTS mn_ReplyPort- pointer to message port that receives I/O request if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear io_Device - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function io_Unit - bit map of channels to load period and volume (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Command - command number for ADCMD_PERVOL io_Flags - flags, must be cleared if not used: IOF_QUICK - (CLEAR) reply I/O request ADIOF_SYNCCYCLE- (CLEAR) load period and volume immediately (SET) load period and volume at the end of the current cycle ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function or ADCMD_ALLOCATE command ioa_Period - new sample period in 279.365 ns increments (124 thru 65536, anti-aliasing filter works below 300 to 500 depending on waveform) ioa_Volume - new volume (0 thru 64, linear) OUTPUTS io_Unit - bit map of channels that successfully loaded period and volume (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Error - error number: 0 - no error ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION - allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) does not match key for channel [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
