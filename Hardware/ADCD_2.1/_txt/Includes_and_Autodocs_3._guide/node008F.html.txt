card.resource/BeginCardAccess ]" border=0> NAME BeginCardAccess -- Called before you begin credit-card memory access SYNOPSIS result=BeginCardAccess( handle ) d0 a1 BOOL BeginCardAccess( struct CardHandle * ); FUNCTION This function should be called before you begin access to credit-card memory. Its effect will depend on the type of Amiga machine your code happens to be running on. On some machines it will cause an access light to be turned ON. INPUTS handle - Same handle as that used when OwnCard() was called. RETURNS TRUE if you are still the owner of the credit-card, and memory access is permitted. FALSE if you are no longer the owner of the credit-card (usually indicating that the card was removed). NOTES This function may be called from within a task, or from a level 1 or level 2 interrupt. It is highly recommended that you call this function before accessing credit-card memory, as well as checking the return value. If it is a return value of FALSE, you should stop accessing credit-card memory. SEE ALSO OwnCard() , EndCardAccess() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
