clipboard.device/CBD_POST ]" border=0> NAME CBD_POST -- Post availability of a clip to the clipboard. FUNCTION Indicate to the clipboard device that data is available for use by accessors of the clipboard. This is intended to be used when a cut is large, in a private data format, and/or changing frequently, and it thus makes sense to avoid converting it to an IFF form and writing it to the clipboard unless another application wants it. The post provides a message port to which the clipboard device will send a satisfy message if the data is required. If the satisfy message is received, the write associated with the post must be performed. The act of writing the clip indicates that the message has been received: it may then be re-used by the clipboard device, and so must actually be removed from the satisfy message port so that the port is not corrupted. If the application wishes to determine if a post it has performed is still the current clip, it should check the post's io_ClipID with that returned by the CBD_CURRENTREADID command. If the current read io_ClipID is greater, the clip is not still current. If an application has a pending post and wishes to determine if it should satisfy it (e.g. before it exits), it should check the post's io_ClipID with that returned by the CBD_CURRENTWRITEID command. If the current write io_ClipID is greater, there is no need to satisfy the post. IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort set up io_Device preset by OpenDevice io_Unit preset by OpenDevice io_Command CBD_POST io_Data pointer to satisfy message port io_ClipID zero RESULTS io_Error non-zero if an error occurred io_ClipID the clip ID assigned to this post, to be used in the write command if this is satisfied [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
