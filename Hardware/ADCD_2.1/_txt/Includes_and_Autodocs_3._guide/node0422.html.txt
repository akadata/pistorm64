layers.library/FattenLayerInfo ]" border=0> NAME FattenLayerInfo -- convert 1.0 LayerInfo to 1.1 LayerInfo OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE SYNOPSIS OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE FattenLayerInfo( li ) a0 LONG FattenLayerInfo( struct Layer_Info *); OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE FUNCTION V1.1 software and any later releases need to have more info in the Layer_Info structure. To do this in a 1.0 supportable manner requires allocation and deallocation of the memory whenever most layer library functions are called. To prevent unnecessary allocation/deallocation FattenLayerInfo will preallocate the necessary data structures and fake out the layer library into thinking it has a LayerInfo gotten from NewLayerInfo . NewLayerInfo is the approved method for getting this structure. When a program needs to give up the LayerInfo structure it must call ThinLayerInfo before freeing the memory. ThinLayerInfo is not necessary if New/DisposeLayerInfo are used however. INPUTS li - pointer to LayerInfo structure BUGS SEE ALSO NewLayerInfo() , ThinLayerInfo() , DisposeLayerInfo() , graphics/layers.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
