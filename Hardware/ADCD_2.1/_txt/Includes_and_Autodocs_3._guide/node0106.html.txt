datatypes.library/--background-- ]" border=0> PURPOSE The datatypes.library provides transparent data handling abilities to applications. Application developers can register their data format with datatypes.library and provide a class library for handling their data within other applications. OVERVIEW * Object Oriented datatypes.library implementation is object oriented, using the boopsi functions of Intuition. Each data class is implemented as a shared system library. * Embedded Objects datatypes.library provides the ability to embed different object types within an application. For example, an application can embed an picture object or even an AmigaGuide document browser within their application's window. Objects can also be embedded within other objects. * Gadget-like Embedded objects are actually boopsi gadgets. That means that input handling is done on Intuition's task. Time intensive operations, such as layout when the window size changes, are off-loaded to a sub-process. Printing, clipboard operations, file read/write are also off-loaded to a separate process on an as-needed basis. * Trigger Methods Sometimes it is necessary for an application to provide additional controls for navigating through an object. For example, with an AmigaGuide object it is necessary to have controls for "Contents", "Index", "Browse >", "Browse Format Conversion As long as the objects are sub-classes of the same class, data from one format can be written out as another format. For example, it is possible to read in an ILBM file and write out a JPEG file, since both data types are sub-classes of PICTURE. * Future Compatible Each class implements a method that returns the supported methods within a class. This way an application can ask an object if it is capable of any particular method, such as DTM_WRITE for example. * Data Type Detection datatypes.library provides the ability to examine a file or the clipboard to determine what type of data it contains.
