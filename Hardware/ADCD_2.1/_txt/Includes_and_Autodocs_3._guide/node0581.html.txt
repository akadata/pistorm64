TITLE: trackdisk.device/CMD_WRITE

trackdisk.device/CMD_WRITE ]" border=0> NAME CMD_WRITE/ETD_WRITE -- write sectors of data to a disk. FUNCTION These commands transfer data from a supplied buffer to the track buffer. If the track that contains this sector is already in the track buffer, no disk activity is initiated. If the desired sector is not in the buffer, the track containing that sector is automatically read in. If the data in the current track buffer has been modified, it is written out to the disk before the new track is read in for modification. ETD_WRITE will write the sector label area if iotd_SecLabel is non-NULL. IO REQUEST INPUT io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command CMD_WRITE or ETD_WRITE io_Flags 0 or IOF_QUICK io_Data pointer to the buffer where the data should be put io_Length number of bytes to write, must be a multiple of TD_SECTOR. io_Offset byte offset from the start of the disk describing where to write data to, must be a multiple of TD_SECTOR. iotd_Count (ETD_WRITE only) maximum allowable change counter value. iotd_SecLabel (ETD_WRITE only) NULL or sector label buffer pointer. If provided, the buffer must be a multiple of TD_LABELSIZE. IO REQUEST RESULT io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in NOTES Under versions of Kickstart earlier than V36, the io_Data had to point to a buffer in chip memory. This restriction is no longer present as of Kickstart V36 and beyond. SEE ALSO CMD_READ , TD_FORMAT [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
