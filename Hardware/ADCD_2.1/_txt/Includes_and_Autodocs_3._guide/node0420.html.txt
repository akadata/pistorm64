This is how the backfill hook in Layers is implemented. This means that hidden simple-refresh cliprects will be ignored. It will call the SuperBitMap cliprects, smart refresh off-screen cliprects, and all on screen cliprects. If the rect parameter is not NULL, the cliprects are bounded to the rectangle given. INPUTS hook - pointer to layer callback Hook which will be called with object == (struct RastPort *) result->RastPort and message == [ (Layer *) layer, (struct Rectangle) bounds, (LONG) offsetx, (LONG) offsety ] This hook should fill the Rectangle in the RastPort with the BackFill pattern appropriate for offset x/y. If hook is LAYERS_BACKFILL, the default backfill is used for the layer. If hook is LAYERS_NOBACKFILL, the layer will not be backfilled (NO-OP). rport- A pointer to the RastPort that is to be operated on. This function will lock the layer if the RastPort is layered... If the rport is non-layered your hook will be called with the rectangle as passed, the RastPort , and a NULL layer... rect - The bounding rectangle that should be used on the layer. This rectangle "clips" the cliprects to the bound given. If this is NULL, no bounding will take place. *MUST* not be NULL if the RastPort is non-layered! NOTES The RastPort you are passed back is the same one passed to the function. You should *not* use "layered" rendering functions on this RastPort . Generally, you will wish to do BitMap operations such as BltBitMap() . The callback is a raw, low-level rendering call-back. If you need to call a rendering operation with a RastPort , make sure you use a copy of the RastPort and NULL the Layer pointer.
