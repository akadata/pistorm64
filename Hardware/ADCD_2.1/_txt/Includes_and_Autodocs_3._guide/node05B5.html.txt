utility.library/UDivMod32 ]" border=0> NAME UDivMod32 -- unsigned 32 by 32 bit division and modulus. (V36) SYNOPSIS quotient:remainder = UDivMod32(dividend,divisor); D0 D1 D0 D1 ULONG:ULONG UDivMod32(ULONG,ULONG); FUNCTION Divides the unsigned 32 bit dividend by the unsigned 32 bit divisor and returns an unsigned 32 bit quotient and remainder. INPUTS dividend - unsigned 32 bit dividend. divisor - unsigned 32 bit divisor. RESULTS quotient - unsigned 32 quotient of the division. remainder - unsigned 32 remainder of the division. NOTES Unlike other Amiga library function calls, the utility.library 32 bit math routines do NOT require A6 to be loaded with a pointer to the library base. A6 can contain anything the application wishes. This is in order to avoid overhead in calling them. In addition, the utility.library math routines preserve all address registers including A0 and A1 SEE ALSO SDivMod32() , SMult32() , UMult32() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
