amiga.lib/CheckRexxMsg ]" border=0> NAME CheckRexxMsg - Check if a RexxMsg is from ARexx SYNOPSIS result = CheckRexxMsg(message) D0 A0 BOOL CheckRexxMsg(struct RexxMsg *); FUNCTION This function checks to make sure that the message is from ARexx directly. It is required when using the Rexx Variable Interface routines (RVI) that the message be from ARexx. While this function is new in the V37 amiga.lib, it is safe to call it in all versions of the operating system. It is also PURE code, thus usable in resident/pure executables. NOTE This is a stub in amiga.lib. It is only available via amiga.lib. The stub has two labels. One, _CheckRexxMsg, takes the arguments from the stack. The other, CheckRexxMsg, takes the arguments in registers. EXAMPLE if (CheckRexxMsg(rxmsg)) { /* Message is one from ARexx */ } INPUTS message A pointer to the RexxMsg in question RESULTS result A boolean - TRUE if message is from ARexx.
