audio.device/CloseDevice ]" border=0> NAME CloseDevice - terminate access to the audio device SYNOPSIS CloseDevice(iORequest); A1 FUNCTION The CloseDevice routine notifies the audio device that it will no longer be used. It takes an I/O audio request block (IOAudio) and clears the device pointer (io_Device). If there are any channels allocated with the same allocation key (ioa_AllocKey), CloseDevice frees (ADCMD_FREE) them. CloseDevice decrements the open count, and if it falls to zero and an expunge (Expunge) is pending, the device is expunged. INPUTS iORequest - pointer to audio request block (struct IOAudio) io_Device - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) open (OpenDevice) io_Unit - bit map of channels to free (ADCMD_FREE) (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, used to free channels OUTPUTS iORequest - pointer to audio request block (struct IOAudio) io_Device - set to -1 io_Unit - set to zero [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
