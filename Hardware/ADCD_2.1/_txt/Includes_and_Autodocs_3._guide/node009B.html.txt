card.resource/GetCardMap ]" border=0> NAME GetCardMap -- Obtain pointer to CardMemoryMap structure SYNOPSIS pointer=GetCardMap() d0 struct CardMemoryMap *GetCardMap( void ); FUNCTION Obtain pointer to a CardMemoryMap structure. The structure is READ only. Devices should never assume credit-card memory appears at any particular place in memory. By using this function to obtain pointers to the base memory locations of the various credit-card memory types, your device will continue to work properly should credit cards appear in different memory locations in future hardware. RETURNS Pointer to CardMemoryMap structure - struct CardMemoryMap { UBYTE *cmm_CommonMemory; UBYTE *cmm_AttributeMemory; UBYTE *cmm_IOMemory; }; As of card.resource V39, this structure has been extended to include the size of these memory regions. See card.h/card.i for the new fields. If card.resource V39, use the constants in the CardMemoryMap structure rather than hard coded constants for memory region size. NOTES If any pointer in the structure is NULL, it means this type of credit-card memory is not being made available. SEE ALSO resources/card.h , resources/card.i [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
