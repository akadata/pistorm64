card.resource/CardInterface ]" border=0> NAME CardInterface -- Determine the type of card interface. SYNOPSIS return = CardInterface() d0 ULONG CardInterface( void ); FUNCTION This function is used to determine the type of credit-card (hardware) interface available. For the most part the card.resource hides the hardware details from devices within its function calls. However should we need to provide a work-around because of differences, or limitations imposed by future interface hardware, this function must be used to identify which interface is available. RETURN A ULONG value as defined in card.h/i. NOTES In general only I/O devices (e.g., a device which interfaces with a modem card) would need to provide work-arounds, or alternative code. An example would be a change in the way interrupt requests from the card are handled. Specific details will be provided as need in the future. I/O devices) should abort properly if this function returns a value which is unknown. Current implementations (see card.h/i) - CARD_INTERFACE_AMIGA_0 ------------------------------------------------------------- The card slot can be configured for use as an I/O interface by using the CardMiscControl() function. The card slot inhibits writes to cards which do not negate the WP status bit. This can be overridden by using the CardMiscControl() function. Changes in the interrupt request line are latched by a gate-array, and have to be obtained via the status change mechanism provided when you call the OwnCard() function. The interrupt is cleared when you return from the status change interrupt. A level 2 interrupt is generated. Usually you will want to clear the interrupt on the card at this time, and Signal() a task. The IRQ line is the same as the RDY/BSY line. Changes in BVD1, WP, and RDY/BSY are also latched by the gate-array, and are obtainable via the status change mechanism provided by the OwnCard() function. A level 2 interrupt is generated. Changes in BVD2 (also used for digital audio) have to be monitored via polling. Generally this will cause no problem. Monitoring changes in BVD1 & BVD2 to monitor for low battery condition can be handled by a low priority tool which periodically checks the condition of both lines using the ReadCardStatus() function. As of card.resource V39 (check VERSION in resource base), the CardMiscControl() function can be used to enable/disable status change interrupts for changes in BVD1, BVD2, and the RDY/BSY status line. Status change interrupts for WR (Write-protect enable/disable) are always enabled. The default state of enabled/disabled status change interrupts noted above are unchanged, and automatically reset to the defaults when a card is removed, or when even a task releases ownership of the card. Some PC oriented eight (8) bit cards may require you read odd-byte I/O address registers at the corresponding even-byte address plus 64K. There is sufficient I/O address space provided that exceeding I/O address space should not be a problem. Your code should wait at least 1 millisecond for Vpp to stabilize after voltage change (see CardProgramVoltage() ).
