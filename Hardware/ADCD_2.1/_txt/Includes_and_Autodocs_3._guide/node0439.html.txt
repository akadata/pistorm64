layout_gc/ActivateLayoutGadget ]" border=0> NAME ActivateLayoutGadget -- Activate a gadget within a layout window. SYNOPSIS Success = ActivateLayoutGadget( Gadget , Window , Request , Object ) d0 a0 a1 a2 d0 BOOL ActivateLayoutGadget( struct Gadget *, struct Window *, struct Requester *, ULONG ); FUNCTION The equivalent of intuition.library ActivateGadget() for a window controlled by layout.gadget. If successful, this means that the user does not need to click in the gadget before typing. The gadget parameter MUST point to the root layout gadget in the window, and the object parameter to the gagdet you wish to activate. This works by calling the private LAYOUT_ACTIVATEOBJECT method to search the layout hierarchy for the specified gadget, and set the handleinput path to that gadget, and finally calling ActivateGadget for the root object. The rules of calling ActivateGadget() apply to ActivateLayoutGadget() also. INPUTS Gadget = pointer to the root layout obejct for the window. Window = pointer to the window the gadget is in. Requester = pointer to a requester (may be NULL) Object = pointer to the BOOPSI object you wish to activate. RESULT If the conditions above (and those of ActivateGadget() ) are met, the function will return TRUE, else FALSE. NOTES Not only string gadgets can be activated this way. Many ReAction gadget classes, such as the button.gadget, also support keyboard control, and thus may be activated this way. An attempt to activate a gadget that is not currently visible (as on a hidden page) will fail. SEE ALSO intuition.library/ActivateGadget() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
