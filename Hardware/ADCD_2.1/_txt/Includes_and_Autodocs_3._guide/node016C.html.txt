This call is buffered. Use Flush() between buffered and unbuffered I/O on a filehandle. Interactive filehandles are flushed automatically on a newline, return, '0', or line feed. INPUTS fh - filehandle to use for buffered I/O char - character to write RESULT char - either the character written, or EOF for an error. BUGS Older autodocs indicated that you should pass a UBYTE .
