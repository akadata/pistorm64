In either event, UP TO the number of len specified bytes minus 1 will be copied into the buffer. Hence if a length of 50 is passed and the input line is longer than 49 bytes, it will return 49 characters. It returns the buffer pointer normally, or NULL if EOF is the first thing read. If terminated by a newline, the newline WILL be the last character in the buffer. This is a buffered read routine. The string read in IS null-terminated. INPUTS fh - filehandle to use for buffered I/O buf - Area to read bytes into. len - Number of bytes to read, must be > 0. RESULT buffer - Pointer to buffer passed in, or NULL for immediate EOF or for an error. If NULL is returnd for an EOF, IoErr() will return 0. BUGS In V36 and V37, it copies one more byte than it should if it doesn't hit an EOF or newline. In the example above, it would copy 50 bytes and put a null in the 51st. This is fixed in dos V39. Workaround for V36/V37: pass in buffersize-1. SEE ALSO FRead() , FPuts() , FGetC() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
