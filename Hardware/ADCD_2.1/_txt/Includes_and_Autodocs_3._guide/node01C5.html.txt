dos.library/SystemTagList ]" border=0> NAME SystemTagList -- Have a shell execute a command line (V36) SYNOPSIS error = SystemTagList(command, tags) D0 D1 D2 LONG SystemTagList(STRPTR, struct TagItem *) error = System(command, tags) D0 D1 D2 LONG System(STRPTR, struct TagItem *) error = SystemTags(command, Tag1, ...) LONG SystemTags(STRPTR, ULONG, ...) FUNCTION Similar to Execute() , but does not read commands from the input filehandle. Spawns a Shell process to execute the command, and returns the returncode the command produced, or -1 if the command could not be run for any reason. The input and output filehandles will not be closed by System, you must close them (if needed) after System returns, if you specified them via SYS_Input or SYS_Output. By default the new process will use your current Input() and Output() filehandles. Normal Shell command-line parsing will be done including redirection on 'command'. The current directory and path will be inherited from your process. Your path will be used to find the command (if no path is specified). Note that you may NOT pass the same filehandle for both SYS_Input and SYS_Output. If you want input and output to both be to the same CON: window, pass a SYS_Input of a filehandle on the CON: window, and pass a SYS_Output of NULL. The shell will automatically set the default Output() stream to the window you passed via SYS_Input, by opening "*" on that handler. If used with the SYS_Asynch flag, it WILL close both it's input and output filehandles after running the command (even if these were your Input() and Output()!) Normally uses the boot (ROM) shell, but other shells can be specified via SYS_UserShell and SYS_CustomShell. Normally, you should send things written by the user to the UserShell. The UserShell defaults to the same shell as the boot shell. The tags are passed through to CreateNewProc() (tags that conflict with SystemTagList() will be filtered out). This allows setting things like priority, etc for the new process. The tags that are currently filtered out are: NP_Seglist NP_FreeSeglist NP_Entry NP_Input NP_Output NP_CloseInput NP_CloseOutput NP_HomeDir NP_Cli INPUTS command - Program and arguments tags - see . Note that both SystemTagList()- specific tags and tags from CreateNewProc() may be passed. RESULT error - 0 for success, result from command, or -1. Note that on error, the caller is responsible for any filehandles or other things passed in via tags. -1 will only be returned if dos could not create the new shell. If the command is not found the shell will return an error value, normally RETURN_ERROR. SEE ALSO Execute() , CreateNewProc() , , Input() , Output() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
