workbench.library/OpenWorkbenchObjectA ]" border=0> NAME OpenWorkbenchObjectA -- Open a drawer or launch a program as if the user had double-clicked on an icon. (V44) SYNOPSIS success = OpenWorkbenchObjectA(name,tags) D0 A0 A1 BOOL OpenWorkbenchObjectA(STRPTR name,struct TagItem *tags); success = OpenWorkbenchObject(name,...); BOOL OpenWorkbenchObject(STRPTR name,...); FUNCTION This routine attempts to open the named object as if the user had double-clicked on its icon. This allows you to open drawers under program control or to have Workbench launch your programs. INPUTS name -- Name of the object to be opened; this can be a drawer name, a tool name or a project name. tags -- Additional options. TAGS WBOPENA_ArgLock (BPTR) -- Corresponds to the WBArg->wa_Lock entry of a WBStartup message, to be sent to a program to be launched. The lock you provide will be duplicated when it is put into a WBArg list. The WBOPENA_ArgLock determines the lock parameters to be associated with all following WBOPENA_ArgName tags. This tag defaults to NULL. WBOPENA_ArgName (STRPTR) -- Corresponds to the WBArg->wa_Name entry of a WBStartup message to be sent to a program to be launched. This tag can be used to construct a list of parameters to pass to the tool/project to be launched. It works in conjunction with the WBOPENA_ArgLock tag. The name you provide will be duplicated when it is put into a WBArg list. RESULTS result -- FALSE if the object in question could not be opened, TRUE otherwise. Note that TRUE may be returned even if the program the object represents could not be launched; this is due to limitations in the current (V44) Workbench design. If FALSE is returned, you can query the error code using dos.library/IoErr() . EXAMPLE /* Launch Multiview with S:Startup-Sequence as its parameter. */ OpenWorkbenchObject("MultiView", WBOPENA_ArgLock, Lock("S:",SHARED_LOCK), WBOPENA_ArgName, "Startup-Sequence", TAG_DONE); /* Launch the application "Paint" with the project files "Image1" * and "Image2", which are both found in the drawer "Paint:Pictures". */ OpenWorkbenchObject("Paint", WBOPENA_ArgLock, Lock("Paint:Pictures",SHARED_LOCK), WBOPENA_ArgName, "Image1", WBOPENA_ArgName, "Image2", TAG_DONE); /* Launch the application "Paint" with the project files "Image1" * and "Anim1", which are both found in the drawers "Paint:Pictures" * and "Paint:Animations", respectively. */ OpenWorkbenchObject("Paint", WBOPENA_ArgLock, Lock("Paint:Pictures",SHARED_LOCK), WBOPENA_ArgName, "Image1", WBOPENA_ArgLock, Lock("Paint:Animations",SHARED_LOCK), WBOPENA_ArgName, "Anim1", TAG_DONE); NOTES You need not specify fully qualified path names for programs to be launched. Workbench will look for files without fully qualified path names along its default Shell search path. In any case, Workbench will look for the tool to be launched in the current directory of the program that called OpenWorkbenchObjectA(). The same holds true for drawers. When launching a program, Workbench will automatically figure out which tool to use if the object in question is actually a project file with a project icon. Note that if the project icon's default tool cannot be found, you will not see any error message. Workbench transparently supports launching of Shell programs, but this is not recommended. You should always launch Shell programs from your own process. When you open a drawer, all WBOPENA_Arg[..] parameters you may have provided will be ignored. For this function call to succeed, Workbench must be open. This means that the LoadWB command was executed and the Workbench screen has been opened. While the user is dragging icons, no on-screen rendering may take place. In this state Workbench may refuse to execute the OpenWorkbenchObject() call and return an error code instead (ERROR_OBJECT_IN_USE).
