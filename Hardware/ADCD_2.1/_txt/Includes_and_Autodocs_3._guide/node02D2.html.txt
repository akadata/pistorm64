(V39) SYNOPSIS color = FindColor( cm, R, G, B , maxpen) a3 d1 d2 d3 d4 ULONG FindColor( struct ColorMap *, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG,LONG); INPUTS cm = colormap R = red level (32 bit left justified fraction) G = green level (32 bit left justified fraction) B = blue level (32 bit left justified fraction) MaxPen = the maximum entry in the color table to search. A value of -1 will limt the search to only those pens which could be rendered in (for instance, it will not examine the sprite colors on a 4 color screen). RESULT The system will attempt to find the color in the passed colormap which most closely matches the RGB values passed. No new pens will be allocated, and you should not ReleasePen() the returned pen. This function is not sensitive to palette sharing issues. Its intended use is for: (a) programs which pop up on public screens when those screens are not using palette sharing. You might use this function as a fallback when ObtainBestPenA() says that there are no sharable pens. (b) Internal color matching by an application which is either running on a non-public screen, or which wants to match colors to an internal color table which may not be associated with any displayed screen. BUGS NOTES In order to use the MaxPen=-1 feature, you must have initialized palette sharing via AttachPalExtra() (all intuition screens do this). Otherwise, MaxPen=-1 will search all colors in the colormap. SEE ALSO ObtainBestPenA() GetColorMap() ObtainPen() ReleasePen() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
