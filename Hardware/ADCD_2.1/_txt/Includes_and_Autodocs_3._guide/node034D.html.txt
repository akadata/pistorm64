icon.library/GetDiskObject ]" border=0> NAME GetDiskObject - read in a Workbench disk object from disk. SYNOPSIS diskobj = GetDiskObject(name) D0 A0 struct DiskObject *GetDiskObject(STRPTR); FUNCTION This routine reads in a Workbench disk object in from disk. The name parameter will have ".info" postpended to it, and the icon file of that name will be read. If the call fails, it will return NULL. The reason for the failure may be obtained via IoErr() . Using this routine protects you from any future changes to the way icons are stored within the system. A FreeList structure is allocated just after the DiskObject structure; FreeDiskObject makes use of this to get rid of the memory that was allocated. INPUTS name -- name of the object (STRPTR) or NULL if you just want a DiskObject structure allocated for you (useful when calling AddAppIcon() in workbench.library).
