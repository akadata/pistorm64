You must clear the screen before you close or unlock it. You must set a valid screen before you call NewObjectA or NewGroupA. Setting a new screen does not mean that the allocated objects are automatically adapt to the new screen. This function only controls the internal housekeeping of the screen (and related structures). If you cannot adapt the allocated objects to a new screen (like setting an attribute with the new screen value) you must dispose and recreate them. If you set the same screen pointer as was before this function does nothing but returns TRUE. INPUTS resource -- a pointer to a resource screen -- a pointer to a Screen or NULL RESULTS success -- TRUE if the screen is successfully set or cleared.
