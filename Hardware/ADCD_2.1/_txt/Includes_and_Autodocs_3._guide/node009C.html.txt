SYNOPSIS result=IfAmigaXIP( handle ) d0 a2 struct Resident *IfAmigaXIP( struct CardHandle * ); FUNCTION Check to see if a card in the slot is an Amiga execute-in-place card. The Card Information Structure must have a valid CISTPL_AMIGAXIP tuple. Tuples can be treated like structures. The format of a CISTPL_AMIGAXIP tuple is - struct TP_AmigaXIP { UBYTE TPL_CODE; UBYTE TPL_LINK; UBYTE TP_XIPLOC[4]; UBYTE TP_XIPFLAGS; UBYTE TP_XIPRESRV; }; The TPL_CODE field must be equal to CISTPL_AMIGAXIP (0x91). The TPL_LINK field must be equal to the length of the body of a CISTPL_AMIGAXIP tuple (0x06). The TP_XIPLOC array is the memory location of your ROM-TAG stored in little-endian order. This value is stored as an "offset" into common memory as is the standard for storing 32 bit bit pointers in tuples. For example, a pointer to a ROM-TAG stored at an offset of 0x00000200 would be stored as four bytes like so: 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00 Currently credit-card common memory is mapped starting at memory location 0x600000. Because a ROM-TAG is used, it is implied that execute-in-place code can be compiled/linked to use absolute references. It is believed that most developers will not want to have to write pc-relative code only. The TP_XIPFLAGS field is treated as a set of flag bits. See card.i/h for defined bits. All undefined bits MUST be 0. The TP_XIPRESRV field must be 0 for now. The system polls for cards which have a CISTPL_AMIGAXIP tuple at the same time that it searches for devices to boot off. When a card with a valid CISTPL_AMIGAXIP tuple is found, the system will call your ROM-TAG via Exec's InitResident() function. The system examines the return code from InitResident() . A NULL return in D0 means you are done with the card, and it can be removed by the user. A successful return indicates you are still using the card. Some programs (e.g., some games) may never return. The only requirement is that if you do return, you must leave the system in a "good" state (including returning most of, or all the memory you allocated). The standard convention for preserving registers apply. Note that your execute-in-place code will not be called a second time, unless you have returned a non-successful result. In this case your execute-in-place code MUST assume the user can remove, and insert your card again. There are a variety of ways to check for re-insertion (e.g., search for a message port, device, library, task, etc., that you created). Note that your execute-in-place code runs in an environment similar to boot block games; before DOS has been initialized! Your execute-in-place code should NOT try to initialize DOS because DOS requires a suitable disk-like device be at the head of the expansion base mountlist to boot off. If you need DOS, it is possible to boot off a credit-card using carddisk.device. Such cards will require a valid CISTPL_DEVICE tuple, and CISTPL_FORMAT tuple. A portion of the card can be used for a minimal number of data blocks like the method described above. However this method is not recommended, though it is anticipated that some developers will have thought of, and used this method anyway. If you must do this, at least use the CardHandle returned by OwnCard() to set hardware reset on removal else the machine will likely crash anyway if the card is removed while your execute-in-place code is running. RETURNS Pointer to a ROM-TAG on the card, or NULL indicating that: o The card does not meet the above requirements, or o The card has been removed, or o You are not the owner of the credit-card. NOTES This function is being made public so developers can test test that their execute-in-place credit-cards meet the requirements for an Amiga execute-in-place card. In general there is no reason for devices, or applications to use this function. Amiga execute-in-place software is identified via a tuple code reserved for manufacturer specific use, therefore the manufacturer of the card may freely use the CISTPL_VERS_1, or CISTPL_VERS_2 tuples to place identification information on the credit-card. No attempt has been made to make use of the MS-DOS execute-in-place method; it is believed that most manufacturers of Amiga execute-in-place software will prefer a simple, and small scheme for running their execute-in-place code.
