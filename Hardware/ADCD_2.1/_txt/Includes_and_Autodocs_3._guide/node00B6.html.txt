cd.device/CD_SEARCH ]" border=0> NAME CD_SEARCH -- configure the mode in which PLAY commands play IO REQUEST io_Command CD_SEARCH io_Data NULL io_Length searchmode io_Offset 0 RESULTS io_Actual - if io_Error is 0, this contains the previous search mode. FUNCTION This command causes a play command to play in fast-forward, fast-reverse, or normal play mode. These modes are defined as: CDMODE_NORMAL 0 Normal play (current speed setting) CDMODE_FFWD 1 Play in fast forward mode CDMODE_FREV 2 Play in fast reverse mode The search mode can be set before the play command is sent, or during a play. If CD_SEARCH is sent before a play command is sent, the mode is set and the command immediately returns. If the mode is set to REV mode, when the play command is sent the play will begin at the requested end position and work backwards to the start position. If CD_SEARCH is sent during a play, the play will automatically switch to the desired mode and continue playing until the original play command is completed. If REV mode is set and the beginning of the play is encountered before switching back to forward play, the play command will terminate with no error. EXAMPLE /* Search in fast forward mode. */ ior->io_Command = CD_SEARCH; ior->io_Data = NULL; ior->io_Offset = 0; ior->io_Length = CDMODE_FFWD; DoIO(ior); NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
