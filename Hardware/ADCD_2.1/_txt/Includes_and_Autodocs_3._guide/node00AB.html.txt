cd.device/CD_PAUSE ]" border=0> NAME CD_PAUSE -- Pause or unPause play command. IO REQUEST io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command CD_PAUSE io_Data NULL io_Length pausemode : 1 = pause play; 0 = do not pause play; io_Offset 0 RESULTS io_Actual - if io_Error is 0, this contains the previous pause state. FUNCTION This command will place the CD in, or take the CD out of pause mode. The desired pause state is placed in io_Length. This command only effects play commands. When the audio is playing and the pausemode is set, this command will immediately pause the audio output suspending the play command until the play is unpaused. When audio is not playing and the pausemode is set, this command will set the pause mode (having no immediate effect). When a play command is submitted, the laser will seek to the appropriate position and pause at that spot. The play command will be suspended until the play is unpaused (or the play is aborted).
