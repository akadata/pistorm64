utility.library/SDivMod32 ]" border=0> NAME SDivMod32 -- signed 32 by 32 bit division and modulus. (V36) SYNOPSIS quotient:remainder = SDivMod32(dividend,divisor); D0 D1 D0 D1 LONG:LONG SDivMod32(LONG,LONG); FUNCTION Divides the signed 32 bit dividend by the signed 32 bit divisor and returns a signed 32 bit quotient and remainder. INPUTS dividend - signed 32 bit dividend. divisor - signed 32 bit divisor. RESULTS quotient - signed 32 quotient of the division. remainder - signed 32 remainder of the division. NOTES Unlike other Amiga library function calls, the utility.library 32 bit math routines do NOT require A6 to be loaded with a pointer to the library base. A6 can contain anything the application wishes. This is in order to avoid overhead in calling them. In addition, the utility.library math routines preserve all address registers including A0 and A1 SEE ALSO SMult32() , UDivMod32() , UMult32() , SMult64() , UMult64() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
