layout_gc/LAYOUT_GetClass ]" border=0> NAME LAYOUT_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the layout class. SYNOPSIS layout_class = LAYOUT_GetClass(); D0 Class * LAYOUT_GetClass(VOID); FUNCTION Obtains the pointer to the layout gadget class for use with NewObject() . This function always returns a valid pointer so you do not need to check it. The reason is that if the library opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup. (Of course this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be calling this.) Note that this function does not create the class, that is done when the class library is opened. INPUTS Nothing. RESULT LayoutClass - Pointer to the layout gadget class. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
