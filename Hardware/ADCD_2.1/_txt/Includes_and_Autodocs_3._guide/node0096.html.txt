card.resource/CardResetCard ]" border=0> NAME CardResetCard -- Reset credit-card. SYNOPSIS success=CardResetCard( handle ); a1 BOOL CardResetCard( struct CardHandle * ); FUNCTION Used to reset a credit-card. Some cards, such as some configurable cards can be reset. Asserts credit-card reset for at least 10us. INPUTS handle - Same handle as that used when OwnCard() was called. RETURNS TRUE - Successful. FALSE - Not successful. Most likely because the credit-card card has been removed, and you are no longer the owner. NOTES This function may be called from within a task, or from a level 1 or level 2 interrupt. ***IMPORTANT*** It is the responsibility of the card owner to reset configurable cards, or any other type of card such as some I/O cards before calling ReleaseCard() if the owner has made use of that card such that it is no longer in its reset state (unless you are releasing the card because it has been removed). If the card manufacturer indicates that a certain amount of time must elapse between end of reset, and completion of card initialization, you should wait at least that long before releasing the card (unless you are releasing the card because it has been removed).
