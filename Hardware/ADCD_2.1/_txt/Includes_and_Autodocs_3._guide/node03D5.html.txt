intuition.library/OpenWindow ]" border=0> NAME OpenWindow -- Open an Intuition window. SYNOPSIS Window = OpenWindow( NewWindow ) D0 A0 struct Window *OpenWindow( struct NewWindow * ); FUNCTION Opens an Intuition window of the given dimensions and position, with the properties specified in the NewWindow structure. Allocates everything you need to get going. New for V36: there is an extensive discussion of public Screens and visitor windows at the end of this section. Also, you can provide extensions to the NewWindow parameters using and array of TagItem structures. See the discussion below, and the documentation for the function OpenScreenTagList() . Before you call OpenWindow(), you must initialize an instance of a NewWindow structure. NewWindow is a structure that contains all of the arguments needed to open a window. The NewWindow structure may be discarded immediately after it is used to open the window. If Type == CUSTOMSCREEN, you must have opened your own screen already via a call to OpenScreen() . Then Intuition uses your screen argument for the pertinent information needed to get your window going. On the other hand, if type == one of the Intuition's standard screens, your screen argument is ignored. Instead, Intuition will check to see whether or not that screen already exists: if it doesn't, it will be opened first before Intuition opens your window in the standard screen. New for V36: If you specify Type == WBENCHSCREEN, then your window will appear on the Workbench screen, unless the global public screen mode SHANGHAI is set, in which case your window will be "hijacked" to the default public screen. See also SetPubScreenModes() . New for V36: If the WFLG_NW_EXTENDED flag is set, it means that the field 'ExtNewWindow->Extension' points to an array of TagItems, as defined in intuition/tagitem.h. This provides an extensible means of providing extra parameters to OpenWindow. For compatibility reasons, we could not add the 'Extension' field to the NewWindow structure, so we have define a new structure ExtNewWindow , which is identical to NewWindow with the addition of the Extension field. We recommend that rather than using ExtNewWindow.Extension, you use the new Intuition function OpenWindowTagList() and its varargs equivalent OpenWindowTags(). We document the window attribute tag ID's (ti_Tag values) here, rather than in OpenWindowTagList() , so that you can find all the parameters for a new window defined in one place. If the WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP flag is set, the bitmap variable must point to your own bitmap. The DetailPen and the BlockPen are used for system rendering; for instance, the title bar is first filled using the BlockPen, and then the gadgets and text are rendered using DetailPen. You can either choose to supply special pens for your window, or, by setting either of these arguments to -1, the screen's pens will be used instead. Note for V36: The DetailPen and BlockPen no longer determine what colors will be used for window borders, if your window opens on a "full-blown new look screen." INPUTS NewWindow = pointer to an instance of a NewWindow structure. That structure is initialized with the following data: ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Left = the initial x-position for your window Top = the initial y-position for your window Width = the initial width of this window Height = the initial height of this window DetailPen = pen number (or -1) for the rendering of window details (like gadgets or text in title bar) BlockPen = pen number (or -1) for window block fills (like title bar) [For V36: Title bar colors are determined otherwise.] Flags = specifiers for your requirements of this window, including: which system gadgets you want attached to your window: - WFLG_DRAGBAR allows this window to be dragged - WFLG_DEPTHGADGET lets the user depth-arrange this window - WFLG_CLOSEGADGET attaches the standard close gadget - WFLG_SIZEGADGET allows this window to be sized. If you ask for the WFLG_SIZEGADGET gadget, you must specify one or both of the flags WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT and WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM below; if you don't, the default is WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT. See the following items WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT and WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM for more details. - WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT is a special system gadget flag that you set to specify whether or not you want the RIGHT border adjusted to account for the physical size of the sizing gadget. The sizing gadget must, after all, take up room in either the right or bottom border (or both, if you like) of the window. Setting either this or the WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM flag selects which edge will take up the slack. This will be particularly useful to applications that want to use the extra space for other gadgets (like a proportional gadget and two Booleans done up to look like scroll bars) or, for for instance, applications that want every possible horizontal bit and are willing to lose lines vertically. NOTE: if you select WFLG_SIZEGADGET, you must select either WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT or WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM or both. If you select neither, the default is WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT. - WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM is a special system gadget flag that you set to specify whether or not you want the BOTTOM border adjusted to account for the physical size of the sizing gadget. For details, refer to WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT above. - WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO for easy but expensive output what type of window layer you want, either: - WFLG_SIMPLE_REFRESH - WFLG_SMART_REFRESH - WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP - WFLG_BACKDROP for whether or not you want this window to be one of Intuition's special backdrop windows. See WFLG_BORDERLESS as well. - WFLG_REPORTMOUSE for whether or not you want to "listen" to mouse movement events whenever your window is the active one. After you've opened your window, if you want to change you can later change the status of this via a call to ReportMouse() . Whether or not your window is listening to mouse is affected by gadgets too, since they can cause you to start getting reports too if you like. The mouse move reports (either InputEvents or messages on the IDCMP) that you get will have the x/y coordinates of the current mouse position, relative to the upper-left corner of your window (WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO notwithstanding). This flag can work in conjunction with the IDCMP Flag called IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE, which allows you to listen via the IDCMP. - WFLG_BORDERLESS should be set if you want a window with no border padding. Your window may have the border variables set anyway, depending on what gadgetry you've requested for the window, but you won't get the standard border lines and spacing that comes with typical windows. This is a good way to take over the entire screen, since you can have a window cover the entire width of the screen using this flag. This will work particularly well in conjunction with the WFLG_BACKDROP flag (see above), since it allows you to open a window that fills the ENTIRE screen. NOTE: this is not a flag that you want to set casually, since it may cause visual confusion on the screen. The window borders are the only dependable visual division between various windows and the background screen. Taking away that border takes away that visual cue, so make sure that your design doesn't need it at all before you proceed. - WFLG_ACTIVATE is the flag you set if you want this window to automatically become the active window. The active window is the one that receives input from the keyboard and mouse. It's usually a good idea to to have the window you open when your application first starts up be an ACTIVATED one, but all others opened later not be ACTIVATED (if the user is off doing something with another screen, for instance, your new window will change where the input is going, which would have the effect of yanking the input rug from under the user). Please use this flag thoughtfully and carefully. Some notes: First, your window may or may not be active by the time this function returns. Use the IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW IDCMP message to know when your window has become active. Also, be very careful not to mistakenly specify the obsolete flag names WINDOWACTIVE or ACTIVEWINDOW. These are used in other contexts, and their values unintentionally added to your flags can cause most unfortunate results. To avoid confusion, they are now know as WFLG_WINDOWACTIVE and IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW. - WFLG_RMBTRAP, when set, causes the right mouse button events to be trapped and broadcast as events. You can receive these events through either the IDCMP or the console. - WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH indicates that you do not wish to be responsible for calling BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh() when your window has exposed regions (i.e., when the IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW message would be generated). See also the descriptions of these two functions. - WFLG_NW_EXTENDED (V36) indicates that NewWindow in fact points to an ExtNewWindow structure, and that the 'Extension' field points to an array of TagItem structures, with meaning described below. - WFLG_NEWLOOKMENUS (V39) Requests new-look menu treatment. Menu colors are derived from the screen DrawInfo BARDETAILPEN, BARBLOCKPEN, and BARTRIMPEN, instead of window detail and block pens. Also requests that a suitably scaled and colored Amiga-key symbol and checkmark symbol be used in the menus. Applications using WFLG_NEWLOOKMENUS need to use the new screen DrawInfo pens to color their MenuItem and SubItem imagery. If your application uses GadTools, the {GTMN_NewLookMenus,TRUE} tag-item should be passed to the menu layout calls. (NB: For the menus to actually appear with improved colors, the screen's opener must supply suitable values for the new menu pens in the DrawInfo . If this is not the case, then an application requesting NewLookMenus will get the scaled Amiga-key and checkmark but in V37-compatible colors. Note that the screen's DrawInfo will always contain valid values for the new pens; they just may correspond to the "old look"). IDCMPFlags = IDCMP is the acronym for Intuition Direct Communications Message Port. (It's Intuition's sole acronym.) If any of the IDCMP Flags is selected, Intuition will create a pair of message ports and use them for direct communications with the task opening this window (as compared with broadcasting information via the Console device). See the "Input and Output Methods" chapter of the Intuition Reference Manual for complete details. You request an IDCMP by setting any of these flags. Except for the special VERIFY flags, every other flag you set tells Intuition that if a given event occurs which your program wants to know about, it is to broadcast the details of that event through the IDCMP rather than via the Console device. This allows a program to interface with Intuition directly, rather than going through the Console device. Many programs have elected to use IDCMP communication exclusively, and not to associate a console with their windows at all. Some operations, such as IDCMP_MENUVERIFY, can ONLY be achieved using IDCMP. The IDCMP flags you can set are described in the ModifyIDCMP() autodoc. Gadgets = the pointer to the first of a linked list of the your own Gadgets which you want attached to this Window . Can be NULL if you have no Gadgets of your own CheckMark = a pointer to an instance of the struct Image where can be found the imagery you want used when any of your menu items is to be checkmarked. If you don't want to supply your own imagery and you want to just use Intuition's own checkmark, set this argument to NULL Text = a null-terminated line of text to appear on the title bar of your window (may be null if you want no text) Type = the screen type for this window. If this equal CUSTOMSCREEN, you must have already opened a CUSTOMSCREEN (see text above). Types available include: - WBENCHSCREEN - CUSTOMSCREEN - PUBLICSCREEN (new for V36, see text below) Screen = if your type is one of Intuition's standard screens, then this argument is ignored. However, if Type == CUSTOMSCREEN, this must point to the structure of your own screen BitMap = if you have specified WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP as the type of refreshing you want for this window, then this value points to a instance of the struct bitmap. However, if the refresh type is NOT WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP, this pointer is ignored. MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth, MaxHeight = the size limits for this window. These must be reasonable values, which is to say that the minimums cannot be greater than the current size, nor can the maximums be smaller than the current size. If they are, they're ignored. Any one of these can be initialized to zero, which means that that limit will be set to the current dimension of that axis. The limits can be changed after the Window is opened by calling the WindowLimits() routine. NOTE: ORIGINALLY, we stated that: "If you haven't requested the WFLG_SIZEGADGET option, these variables are ignored so you don't have to initialize them." It is now clear that a variety of programs take it upon themselves to call SizeWindow() (or ChangeWindowBox() ) without your program's consent or consulting your WFLG_SIZEGADGE option. To protect yourself against the results, we strongly urge that if you supply suitable values for these fields even if you do not specify WFLG_SIZEGADGET. The maximums may be LARGER than the current size, or even larger than the current screen. The maximums should be set to the highest value your application can handle. This allows users with larger display devices to take full advantage of your software. If there is no good reason to limit the size, then don't. -1 or ~0 indicates that the maximum size is only limited by the size of the window's screen. See also the docs on the function WindowLimits() for more information. Extension (New for V36) = a pointer to an array (or chain of arrays) of TagItems to specify additional parameters to OpenWindow(). TagItems in general are described in utility/tagitem.h , and the OpenWindow tags are defined in intuition/intuition.h and described here. For items pertaining to Public Screens and visitor windows, please see below. Here are the TagItem.ti_Tag values that are defined for OpenWindow (and OpenWindowTagList() ). Certain tags simply override equivalent values in NewWindow , and allow you to open a window using OpenWindowTagList() without having a NewWindow structure at all. In each case, cast the corresponding data to ULONG and put it in ti_Data. The compatible tag items include: WA_Left WA_Top WA_Width WA_Height WA_DetailPen - NOTE: only overrides NewWindow.DetailPen of -1! WA_BlockPen - NOTE: only overrides NewWindow.BlockPen of -1! WA_IDCMP WA_Flags - initial values for Flags before looking at other Boolean component Tag values WA_Gadgets WA_Title WA_CustomScreen - also implies CUSTOMSCREEN property WA_SuperBitMap - also implies WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP refresh mode. WA_MinWidth WA_MinHeight WA_MaxWidth WA_MaxHeight These Boolean tag items are alternatives to the NewWindow.Flags Boolean attributes with similar names. WA_SizeGadget - equivalent to WFLG_SIZEGADGET WA_DragBar - equivalent to WFLG_DRAGBAR WA_DepthGadget - equivalent to WFLG_DEPTHGADGET WA_CloseGadget - equivalent to WFLG_CLOSEGADGET WA_Backdrop - equivalent to WFLG_BACKDROP WA_ReportMouse - equivalent to WFLG_REPORTMOUSE WA_NoCareRefresh - equivalent to WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH WA_Borderless - equivalent to WFLG_BORDERLESS WA_Activate - equivalent to WFLG_ACTIVATE WA_RMBTrap - equivalent to WFLG_RMBTRAP WA_WBenchWindow - equivalent to WFLG_WBENCHWINDOW (system PRIVATE) WA_SimpleRefresh - only specify if TRUE WA_SmartRefresh - only specify if TRUE WA_SizeBRight - equivalent to WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT WA_SizeBBottom - equivalent to WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM WA_GimmeZeroZero - equivalent to WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO WA_NewLookMenus - equivalent to WFLG_NEWLOOKMENUS The following tag items specify new attributes of a window. WA_ScreenTitle - You can specify the screen title associated with your window this way, and avoid a call to SetWindowTitles() when your window opens. WA_AutoAdjust - a Boolean attribute which says that it's OK to move or even shrink the dimensions of this window to fit it on the screen, within the dimension limits specified by MinWidth and MinHeight. Someday, this processing might be sensitive to the currently visible portion of the screen the window will be opening on, so don't draw too many conclusions about the auto-adjust algorithms. (Normally, this attribute defaults to FALSE. However, if you call OpenWindowTags() or OpenWindowTagList() with a NULL NewWindow pointer, this attribute defaults to TRUE). WA_InnerWidth WA_InnerHeight - You can specify the dimensions of the interior region of your window, independent of what the border thicknesses will be. You probably want to specify WA_AutoAdjust to allow Intuition to move your window or even shrink it so that it is completely on screen. Note: using these tags puts some reasonable restrictions on the gadgets you can specify as "border" gadgets when you open your window. Since border gadgets determine the border dimensions and hence the overall dimensions of your window, those dimensions cannot be used calculating the position or dimensions of border gadgets. Here's the complete list of restrictions: - GACT_LEFTBORDER gadgets cannot be GFLG_RELWIDTH if WA_InnerWidth is used. - GACT_RIGHTBORDER gadgets MUST be GFLG_RELRIGHT if WA_InnerWidth is used. - GACT_TOPBORDER gadgets cannot be GFLG_RELHEIGHT if WA_InnerHeight is used. - GACT_BOTTOMBORDER gadgets MUST be GFLG_RELBOTTOM if WA_InnerHeight is used. WA_PubScreenName - This tag item declares that you want your window to open as a visitor window on the public screen whose name is pointed to by (UBYTE *) ti_Data. WA_PubScreen - Open as a visitor window on the public screen whose address if provided as (struct Screen *) ti_Data. To ensure that this screen remains open long enough, you must either: 1) Be the screen's owner 2) have another window already open on the screen 3) use LockPubScreen() Using exec.library/Forbid() is not sufficient. You can provide ti_Data to be NULL (zero), without any of the above precautions, to specify the default public screen. WA_PubScreenFallBack - This Boolean attribute specifies that a visitor window should "fall back" to opening on the default public screen if the explicitly specify public screen is not available. WA_WindowName - this visionary specification of a window rendezvous name string is not yet implemented. WA_Colors - this equally great idea about associating a palette specification with the active window may not ever be implemented. WA_Zoom - ti_Data points to an array of four WORD's to be used as the initial Left/Top/Width/Height of the "alternate Zoom position and dimensions." The presence of this tag item implies that you want a Zoom gadget, even though you might not have a sizing gadget. New for V39: if the initial zoom-box left and top are both set to ~0, then Intuition will give your window "size-only" zooming, meaning that zooming the window will not affect the left/top unless the window needs to be moved on-screen. WA_MouseQueue - This tag specifies a limit for the number of outstanding IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE IntuiMessages that Intuition will send to your window. You can change the value of this limit after the window is open using SetMouseQueue() . WA_RptQueue - This tag specifies a limit for the number of outstanding repeated-IDCMP_RAWKEY, repeated-IDCMP_VANILLAKEY, and repeated-IDCMP_IDCMPUPDATE IntuiMessages that Intuition will send to your window. Currently, there is no function to adjust the repeat-key queue. WA_BackFill - ti_Data is a pointer to a Hook structure that the Layers library will call when your window needs "backfilling." See layers.library/InstallLayerHook() . WA_MenuHelp - ti_Data is a boolean. If true, enables the MenuHelp feature for this window. See IDCMP_MENUHELP above. (V37) WA_NotifyDepth - ti_Data is a boolean. Set to true if you would also like IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW events sent to your window when it is depth-arranged. Normally, such events are only sent for movement or resizing of the window. IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW events originating from depth-arrangement have a Code equal to CWCODE_DEPTH, as opposed to CWCODE_MOVESIZE. (V39) WA_Checkmark - (ti_Data is struct Image *) Image to use as a checkmark in menus. Prior to V39, or if WA_NewLookMenus is not specified, the default will be the traditional checkmark in the original colors. Under V39 and higher, if you have requested WA_NewLookMenus then the default will be an appropriately colored checkmark scaled to the screen's font. Alternately, you can provide a custom one, which you can design yourself or get from sysiclass (use this if your menu-font is different from the screen's font). WA_AmigaKey - (ti_Data is struct Image *) Image to use as the Amiga-key symbol in menus. If WA_NewLookMenus is not specified, the default will be the traditional Amiga-key symbol in the original colors. If you've requested WA_NewLookMenus, then the default will be an appropriately colored Amiga-key scaled to the screen's font. Alternately, you can provide a custom one, which you can design yourself or get from sysiclass (use this if your menu-font is different from the screen's font). (V39) WA_Pointer - (APTR) The pointer you wish to associate with your window. If NULL, you are requesting the Preferences default pointer. Custom pointers should be allocated by performing a NewObject() on "pointerclass". (See ). Defaults to NULL. This tag is also recognized by SetWindowPointerA() . (V39) WA_BusyPointer (BOOL) - Set to TRUE to request the Preferences busy-pointer. If FALSE, your pointer will be as requested by WA_Pointer. Defaults to FALSE. This tag is also recognized by SetWindowPointerA() . (V39) WA_PointerDelay - (BOOL) Set to TRUE to defer changing your pointer for a brief instant. This is typically used along with setting the busy pointer, especially when the application knows it may be busy for a very short while. If the application clears the pointer or sets another pointer before the delay expires, the pending pointer change is cancelled. This reduces short flashes of the busy pointer. This tag is also recognized by SetWindowPointerA() . (V39) WA_HelpGroup - (ULONG) Normally, only the active window can receive IDCMP_GADGETHELP messages. However, an application with multiple windows will want all its windows to be able to receive help when any of them are active. First obtain a unique help ID with utility.library/GetUniqueID() , then pass it as ti_Data of this tag to all your windows. See HelpControl() . (V39) WA_HelpGroupWindow - (struct Window *) Instead of using WA_HelpGroup, you can pass a pointer to another window whose HelpGroup you wish this window to belong to. (V39) WA_TabletMessages - (BOOL) Set to TRUE to request extended IntuiMessages for your window. If a tablet driver is generating IESUBCLASS_NEWTABLET input events, you will be able to receive extended tablet information with most IntuiMessages. See the eim_TabletData field of the ExtIntuiMessage structure. Defaults to FALSE. (V39) NOTES Regarding Public Screens, you can specify a window to be a "visitor window" on a public screen in one of several ways. In each case, you must be sure not to specify a NewWindow type of CUSTOMSCREEN. You should use the value PUBLICSCREEN. There are actually several ways you can specify which screen you want a visitor window to be opened on: 1) Specify the name of the public screen WA_PubScreenName, or a NULL pointer, in ti_Data. The name might have been provided by the user. A NULL pointer means to use the default public screen. If the named screen cannot be found, the default public screen will be used if the Boolean attribute WA_PubScreenFallBack is TRUE. 2) Specify a pointer to a public screen using the WA_PubScreen tag item. The WA_PubScreenFallBack attribute has no effect. You can specify the default public screen by providing a NULL pointer. You can also specify the pointer by setting NewWindow.Type to PUBLICSCREEN, and specifying the public screen pointer in NewWindow.Screen. The WA_PubScreen tag item has precedent over this technique. Unless NULL, the screen pointer provided MUST be a valid public screen. You may ensure this several ways: - Be the owner of the screen. - Have a window already open on the screen. - Use LockPubScreen() to prevent the screen from closing. - specifying the WFLG_VISITOR bit in NewWindow.Flags is not supported. It is anticipated that the last will be the most common method of opening public screens because you often want to examine properties of the screen your window will be using in order to compensate for differences in dimension, depth, and font. The standard sequence for this method is as follows: LockPubScreen() - obtain a pointer and a promise layout window - adapt your window to the screen you will use OpenWindow() - using the pointer you specify UnlockPubScreen() - once your window is open, you can let go of the lock on the public screen ... normal window even processing ... CloseWindow() . Regarding "service" windows, such as those opened for a system requester or file requester associated with a given "client"window. These windows should NOT be "visitor" windows. Open them using NewWindow.Type = CUSTOMSCREEN and NewWindow.Screen equal to the screen of the client window (window->WScreen). You can also use WA_CustomScreen, which has precedence. This ensures that the requester service window will be allowed to open on the same screen as the client window, even if that screen is not a public screen, or has private status. This has an implication for service/client protocol: when you pass a window pointer to any system requester routine or to a routine which creates some other other service window, you MUST keep your window open until the client window is closed. If a requester service will allow a NULL client window, this should indicate to open the service window on the default public screen (probably Workbench). The correct way to get a pointer to this screen is to call LockPubScreen( NULL ). In this case, you want to open as a visitor window, which means you should use either PUBLICSCREEN or WA_PubScreen, described above. You should call UnlockPubScreen() after your visitor window is open. As of V36, gadgets in the right and bottom border (specified with GACT_RIGHTBORDER and GACT_BOTTOMBORDER) only contribute to the dimensions of the borders if they are also GFLG_RELRIGHT and GFLG_RELBOTTOM, respectively. RESULT If all is well, returns the pointer to your new Window If anything goes wrong, returns NULL BUGS When you open a window, Intuition will set the font of the window's RastPort to the font of the window's screen. This does not work right for GimmeZeroZero windows: the BorderRPort RastPort has the font set correctly, but Window.RPort is set up with the system default font. For compatibility reasons, we won't be fixing this problem. Also, there is a compatibility trick going on with the default font of your window's RastPort if the screen's font is "fancy." See the SA_SysFont attribute described under OpenScreen() . Unless you arrange otherwise, each window you open will allocate a signal for your task from the 16 "user signals." If no signal is available, your window will not be able to be opened. In early V36 versions and before, Intuition didn't check this condition, but just left you with an unusable port.
