(V39) SYNOPSIS success = ChangeScreenBuffer( Screen , ScreenBuffer ) D0 A0 A1 ULONG ChangeScreenBuffer( struct Screen *, struct ScreenBuffer * ); FUNCTION Performs double (or multiple) buffering on an Intuition screen in an Intuition-cooperative manner. The BitMap associated with the supplied ScreenBuffer will be installed in the specified screen, if possible. The previously-installed BitMap is available for re-use upon receiving a signal from graphics.library. See the graphics.library autodocs for graphics.library/AllocDBufInfo() and graphics.library/ChangeVPBitMap() for details. INPUTS Screen: pointer to the screen whose bitmap is to be swapped. ScreenBuffer: pointer to a ScreenBuffer structure obtained from AllocScreenBuffer() . RESULT Returns non-zero if the operation succeeded. Returns zero if the operation cannot be performed. This function will fail if Intuition's state cannot permit it, for example the user is playing with menus or gadgets. NOTES It is not required to restore the original ScreenBuffer before closing the screen. Simply FreeScreenBuffer() each buffer (including the original and the currently-installed one) then close the screen. Of course, you cannot call ChangeScreenBuffer() after freeing the currently-installed one.
