intuition.library/ScrollWindowRaster ]" border=0> NAME ScrollWindowRaster -- Intuition-friendly ScrollRasterBF() (V39) SYNOPSIS ScrollWindowRaster(win, dx, dy, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) A1 D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 void ScrollWindowRaster(struct Window *, WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD); FUNCTION Calls graphics.library/ScrollRasterBF() , which moves the bits in the raster by (dx,dy) towards (0,0) The space vacated is filled by calling EraseRect() . NOTE: that vacated space is _not_ considered damage! The scroll operation is limited to the rectangle defined by (xmin,ymin)-(xmax,ymax). Bits outside will not be affected. If (xmax,ymax) is outside the rastport then use the lower right corner of the rastport. If a window is partly obscured, then it is possible for ScrollWindowRaster() to scroll some of the obscured area into view. If the window is simple-refresh, then the formerly obscured area is damage, and the application needs to repair it. If Intuition detects damage as a result of ScrollWindowRaster(), it will send an IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW event to the application's window. This handling of damage is the principal reason ScrollWindowRaster() is preferred to ScrollRaster() and ScrollRasterBF() . INPUTS win - pointer to a Window structure dx,dy are integers that may be postive, zero, or negative xmin,ymin - upper left of bounding rectangle xmax,ymax - lower right of bounding rectangle NOTES This call uses ScrollRasterBF() , which calls EraseRect() when clearing the newly exposed area. This allows use of a custom layer backfill hook. IMPORTANT: boopsi gadgets should use ScrollRaster() or ScrollRasterBF() directly! Never call ScrollWindowRaster() from inside a boopsi gadget's method handler. Note that Intuition will detect and handle damage caused by such use of ScrollRaster() or ScrollRasterBF() , for gadgets with the GMORE_SCROLLRASTER property. VERY IMPORTANT: if you have any gadgets in your simple-refresh window with the GMORE_SCROLLRASTER property, you must use ScrollWindowRaster() instead of ScrollRaster() or ScrollRasterBF() . Handling of gadget scroll damage is incompatible with continued use of these graphics functions in an Intuition window. NB: If you're using a gadget class whose source code you do not control, that class might be using GMORE_SCROLLRASTER or might start to in a future version. For that reason, you should use ScrollWindowRaster() if you are using any such gadgets. BUGS In intuition.library V39 and V40 ScrollWindowRaster() must be considered unsafe in connection with gadget event handling and windows which do not have the WA_NoCareRefresh attribute set. A race condition may occur which will cause write accesses to unallocated memory and keep the IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW message from getting delivered. The recommended workaround for this problem is to use ScrollWindowRaster() only in SMART_REFRESH windows which have the WA_NoCareRefresh attribute set. Of course, which such windows there will be no difference in functionality between ScrollWindowRaster() and ScrollRasterBF() .
