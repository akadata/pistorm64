SYNOPSIS RefreshGList( Gadgets, Window , Requester , NumGad ) A0 A1 A2 D0 VOID RefreshGList( struct Gadget *, struct Window *, struct Requester *, WORD ); FUNCTION Refreshes (redraws) gadgets in the gadget list starting from the specified gadget. At most NumGad gadgets are redrawn. If NumGad is -1, all gadgets until a terminating NULL value in the NextGadget field is found will be refreshed, making this routine a superset of RefreshGadgets() . The Requester parameter can point to a Requester structure. If the first gadget in the list has the GTYP_REQGADGET flag set, the gadget list refers to gadgets in a requester and the pointer must necessarily point to a window. If these are not the gadgets of a requester, the requester argument may be NULL. Be sure to see the RefreshGadgets() function description, as this function is simply an extension of that. INPUTS Gadgets = pointer to the first in the list of gadgets wanting refreshment Window = pointer to the window containing the gadget or its requester Requester = pointer to a requester (ignored if Gadget is not attached to a Requester). NumGad = maximum number of gadgets to be refreshed. A value of -1 will cause all gadgets to be refreshed from gadget to the end of the list. A value of -2 will also do this, but if 'Gadgets' points to a Requester Gadget (GTYP_REQGADGET) ALL gadgets in the requester will be refreshed (this is a mode compatible with v1.1 RefreshGadgets().)
