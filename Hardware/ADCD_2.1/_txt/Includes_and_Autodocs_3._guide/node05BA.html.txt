workbench.library/AddAppIconA ]" border=0> NAME AddAppIconA - add an icon to Workbench's list of AppIcons. (V36) SYNOPSIS AppIcon = AddAppIconA(id, userdata, text, msgport, D0 D0 D1 A0 A1 lock, diskobj, taglist) A2 A3 A4 struct AppIcon *AddAppIconA(ULONG, ULONG, char *, struct MsgPort *, BPTR , struct DiskObject *, struct TagItem *); Alternate, varargs version: struct AppIcon *AddAppIcon(ULONG, ULONG, char *, struct MsgPort *, BPTR , struct DiskObject *, tag1, data1, tag2, data2, ... TAG_END ); FUNCTION Attempt to add an icon to Workbench's list of AppIcons. If successful, the icon is displayed on the Workbench backdrop (the same place disk icons are displayed). This call is provided to allow applications to be notified when a graphical object (not neccessarely associated with a file) gets 'manipulated'. The notification consists of an AppMessage (found in workbench.h/i) of type 'MTYPE_APPICON' arriving at the message port you specified. The types of 'manipulation' that can occur are: 1. Double-clicking on the icon. am_NumArgs will be zero and am_ArgList will be NULL. 2. Dropping an icon or icons on your AppIcon . am_NumArgs will be the number of icons dropped on your AppIcon plus one. am_ArgList will be an array of pointers to WBArg structures. Refer to the 'WBStartup Message' section of the RKM for more info. 3. Dropping your AppIcon on another icon. NOT SUPPORTED. 4. Invoking an "Icons" menu item with your icon selected. (V44) You have to tell Workbench which menu items your icon responds to using the tag item list you provide to AddAppIconA(). When one of the supported menu items is invoked, you will receive an AppMessage with the am_Class entry set to a value out of AMCLASSICON_Open..AMCLASSICON_EmptyTrash, corresponding to the menu item used. INPUTS id - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by Workbench. Typical uses in C are in switch and case statements, and in assembly language table lookup. userdata - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by Workbench. text - name of icon (char *) lock - NULL (Currently unused) msgport - pointer to message port Workbench will use to send you an AppMessage message of type 'MTYPE_APPICON' when your icon gets 'manipulated' (explained above). diskobj - pointer to a DiskObject structure filled in as follows: do_Magic - NULL do_Version - NULL do_Gadget - a gadget structure filled in as follows: NextGadget - NULL LeftEdge - NULL TopEdge - NULL Width - width of icon hit-box Height - height of icon hit-box Flags - NULL or GADGHIMAGE Activation - NULL GadgetType - NULL GadgetRender - pointer to Image structure filled in as follows: LeftEdge - NULL TopEdge - NULL Width - width of image (must be Image struct or NULL GadgetText - NULL MutualExclude - NULL SpecialInfo - NULL GadgetID - NULL UserData - NULL do_Type - NULL do_DefaultTool - NULL do_ToolTypes - NULL do_CurrentX - NO_ICON_POSITION (recommended) do_CurrentY - NO_ICON_POSITION (recommended) do_DrawerData - NULL do_ToolWindow - NULL do_StackSize - NULL (an easy way to create one of these (a DiskObject) is to create an icon with the V2.0 icon editor and save it out. Your application can then call GetDiskObject on it and pass that to AddAppIcon.) taglist - ptr to a list of tag items. Must be NULL for V2.0. TAGS WBAPPICONA_SupportsOpen (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Open" menu, to FALSE otherwise. Note that with this attribute set to FALSE, users will still be able to double-click on your AppIcon and drop icons on it. This attribute solely controls whether the "Open" menu item will be available. This tag defaults to TRUE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsCopy (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Copy" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsRename (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Rename" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsInformation (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Information" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsSnapshot (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Snapshot" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsUnSnapshot (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "UnSnapshot" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsLeaveOut (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Leave Out" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsPutAway (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Put Away" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsDelete (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Delete" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsFormatDisk (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the " Format Disk" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_SupportsEmptyTrash (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if your AppIcon should respond to the "Empty Trash" menu, to FALSE otherwise. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_PropagatePosition (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE if you want the AppIcon's position to be propagated back to the original DiskObject you passed to this function. By default, Workbench will make a copy of that DiskObject's icon imagery, allowing you to free the DiskObject . But if you specify "WBAPPICONA_PropagatePosition,TRUE," Workbench will assume that you will not free it and that the AppIcon's current position should be stored in its do_CurrentX/do_CurrentY members. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) WBAPPICONA_RenderHook (struct Hook *) -- Pointer to a hook that will be invoked when rendering your AppIcon . With this hook and WorkbenchControlA() you can create dynamic or animated AppIcons. Your hook will be called with the following parameters and has to return a result value: result = hookFunc(hook,reserved,arm) D0 A0 A2 A1 LONG hookFunc(struct Hook *hook, APTR reserved, struct AppIconRenderMsg *arm); The reserved parameter will be set to NULL (V44). If your hook code returns TRUE, the AppIcon's regular image will be drawn. If your code returns FALSE, the regular image will not be drawn; this allows you to do all the icon's on-screen rendering with the exception of the icon image used when dragging the icon on the screen. The render message contents are as follows: arm_RastPort A pointer to the RastPort to render into. arm_Icon A pointer to the Icon to be rendered. arm_Label A pointer to the label text to be printed below the icon. arm_Tags Further control tags which you should pass on to icon.library/DrawIconStateA , should you call this routine. arm_Left arm_Top Rendering origin; note that these coordinates DO NOT take the embossing border sizes into account. arm_Width arm_Height Size of the Icon's image area; you should limit your drawing to this area. arm_State An icon drawing state, such as used by icon.library/DrawIconStateA . Note that all the data in the render message is read-only. This tag defaults to NULL. (V44) WBAPPICONA_NotifySelectState (BOOL) -- Set this tag to TRUE if you want to be be notified whenever the AppIcon becomes selected or unselected. You will hear only state transitions, i.e. changes from selected to unselected state and the other way round. On a state transition you will receive AppMessages with the AppMessage->am_Class member set to AMCLASSICON_Selected or AMCLASSICON_Unselected, respectively. This tag defaults to FALSE. (V44) RESULTS AppIcon - a pointer to an AppIcon structure which you pass to RemoveAppIcon when you want to remove the icon from Workbench's list of AppIcons. NULL if Workbench was unable to add your icon; typically happens when Workbench is not running or under low memory conditions. EXAMPLE You could design a print-spooler icon and add it to the Workbench. Any file dropped on the print spooler would be printed. If the user double-clicked (opened) your printer-spooler icon, you could open a window showing the status of the print spool, allow changes to print priorities, allow deletions, etc. If you registered this window as an 'AppWindow' (explained in workbench.library/AddAppWindow) files could also be dropped in the window and added to the spool. NOTES For this function call to succeed, Workbench must be open. This means that the LoadWB command was executed and the Workbench screen has been opened.
