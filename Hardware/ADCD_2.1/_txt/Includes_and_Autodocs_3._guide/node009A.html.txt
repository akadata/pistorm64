TITLE: card.resource/EndCardAccess

card.resource/EndCardAccess ]" border=0> NAME EndCardAccess -- Called at the end of credit-card memory access SYNOPSIS result=EndCardAccess( handle ) d0 a1 ULONG EndCardAccess( struct CardHandle * ); FUNCTION This function should be called when you are done accessing credit-card memory. Its effect will depend on the type of Amiga machine your code happens to be running on. On some machines it will cause an access light to be turned OFF in approximately 1/2 second. On machines which support an access light, the light will automatically be turned off when you call ReleaseCard() . INPUTS handle - Same handle as that used when OwnCard() was called. RETURNS TRUE if you are still the owner of the credit-card. FALSE if you are no longer the owner of the credit-card (usually indicating the card was removed). NOTES This function may be called from within a task, or from a level 1 or level 2 interrupt. It is highly recommended that you call this function after accessing credit-card memory, as well as checking the return value. If it is a return value of FALSE, you should stop accessing credit-card memory, and conclude that the card was removed before this function was called. On some machines it is possible that the credit-card will be removed before you receive the removed interrupt. SEE ALSO OwnCard() , ReleaseCard() , BeginCardAccess() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
