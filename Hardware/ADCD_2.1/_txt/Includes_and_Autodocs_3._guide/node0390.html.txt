SYNOPSIS ActivateWindow( Window ) A0 VOID ActivateWindow( struct Window * ); FUNCTION Activates an Intuition window. Note that this call may have its action deferred: you cannot assume that when this call is made the selected window has become active. This action will be postponed while the user plays with gadgets and menus, or sizes and drags windows. You may detect when the window actually has become active by the IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW IDCMP message. This call is intended to provide flexibility but not to confuse the user. Please call this function synchronously with some action by the user. INPUTS Window = a pointer to a Window structure RESULT None. BUGS Some versions of the documentation claimed that this function had a meaningful return value under V36 and higher. That is not true. Calling this function in a tight loop can blow out Intuition's deferred action queue. SEE ALSO OpenWindow() , and the WFLG_ACTIVATE window flag [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
