It computes the cosine and places it in *pfnum2. It computes the sine and returns it as a result. INPUTS fnum1 - Motorola fast floating point number pfnum2 - pointer to Motorola fast floating point number RESULT *pfnum2 - Motorola fast floating point number (cosine) fnum3 - Motorola fast floating point number (sine) BUGS None SEE ALSO SPSin() , SPCos() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
