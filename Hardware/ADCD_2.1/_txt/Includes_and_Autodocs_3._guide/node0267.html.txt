expansion.library/ObtainConfigBinding ]" border=0> NAME ObtainConfigBinding - try to get permission to bind drivers SYNOPSIS ObtainConfigBinding() FUNCTION ObtainConfigBinding gives permission to bind drivers to ConfigDev structures. It exists so two drivers at once do not try and own the same ConfigDev structure. This call will block until it is safe proceed. It is crucially important that people lock out others before loading new drivers. Much of the data that is used to configure things is statically kept, and others need to be kept from using it. This call is built directly on Exec SignalSemaphore code (e.g. ObtainSemaphore). INPUTS RESULTS EXCEPTIONS SEE ALSO ReleaseConfigBinding() BUGS [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
