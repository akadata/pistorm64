dos.library/FindSegment ]" border=0> NAME FindSegment - Finds a segment on the resident list (V36) SYNOPSIS segment = FindSegment(name, start, system) D0 D1 D2 D3 struct Segment *FindSegment(STRPTR, struct Segment *, LONG) FUNCTION Finds a segment on the Dos resident list by name and type, starting at the segment AFTER 'start', or at the beginning if start is NULL. If system is zero, it will only return nodes with a seg_UC of 0 or more. It does NOT increment the seg_UC, and it does NOT do any locking of the list. You must Forbid() lock the list to use this call. To use an entry you have found, you must: if the seg_UC is 0 or more, increment it, and decrement it (under Forbid()!) when you're done the the seglist. The other values for seg_UC are: -1 - system module, such as a filesystem or shell -2 - resident shell command -999 - disabled internal command, ignore Negative values should never be modified. All other negative values between 0 and -32767 are reserved to AmigaDos and should not be used. INPUTS name - name of segment to find start - segment to start the search after system - true for system segment, false for normal segments RESULT segment - the segment found or NULL SEE ALSO AddSegment() , RemSegment() , Forbid() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
