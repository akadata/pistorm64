button_gc/BUTTON_GetClass ]" border=0> NAME BUTTON_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the button class. SYNOPSIS button_class = BUTTON_GetClass(); D0 Class * BUTTON_GetClass(VOID); FUNCTION This function is only available in runtime linked version of the class, and is not in the compiler linker library button_gc.lib. Obtains the pointer to the Button gadget class for use with NewObject() . This function always returns a valid pointer so you do not need to check it. The reason is that if the library opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup. (Of course this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be calling this.) Note that this function does not create the class, that is done when the class library is opened. INPUTS Nothing. RESULT button_class - Pointer to the Button gadget class.
