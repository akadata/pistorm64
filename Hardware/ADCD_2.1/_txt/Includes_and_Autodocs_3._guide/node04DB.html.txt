nonvolatile.library/--background-- ]" border=0> PURPOSE The nonvolatile library provides a simple means for an application developer to manage nonvolatile storage. OVERVIEW The nonvolatile library is meant to be used transparently across all configurations. Currently, nonvolatile storage may consist of NVRAM and/or disk devices. nonvolatile.library will automatically access the best nonvolatile storage available in the system. Disk based storage will be selected first and if not available, NVRAM storage will be accessed. * NVRAM On low-end diskless Amiga platforms, NVRAM may be available. This RAM will maintain its data contents when the system is powered down. This is regardless of whether batteries or battery-backed clock are present. The data stored in NVRAM is accessible only through the ROM-based nonvolatile library funtion calls. The size of NVRAM storage is dependant on the system platform and is attainable through the GetNVInfo() function. * Disk In keeping with the general configurability of the Amiga, the actual disk location used by nonvolatile library when storing to disk may be changed by the user. The prefs directory is used on the Amiga for storing many user configurable options. The location for nonvolatile disk storage is contained in the file prefs/env-archive/sys/nv_location. This file should contain a data string that specifies a lockable location. If the string does not specify a lockable location, the file will be ignored. When opened, the nonvolatile library will search all drives within the system until it finds this file and successfully accomplishes a Lock on the location specified in the file. To force a rescan of all drives, the library may be closed and reopened or execute the GetNVInfo() function. A simple method for creating a floppy disk for saving nonvolatile data is the following: Format a disk with the volume name NV Create a file prefs/env-archive/sys/nv_location on this disk with the following contents: NV:nonvolatile Create a directory nonvolatile The following is a script file that can be used to make a floppy for use with nonvolatile library: .KEY DRIVE/A,DISK .BRA { .KET } format Drive {DRIVE} Name {DISK$NV} noicons ffs makedir {DRIVE}prefs makedir {DRIVE}nonvolatile makedir {DRIVE}prefs/env-archive makedir {DRIVE}prefs/env-archive/sys echo {DISK$NV}:nonvolatile >{DRIVE}prefs/env-archive/sys/nv_location !!!NOTE!!! Because NVRAM performs disk access, you must open and use its functionality from a DOS process, not an EXEC task. Normally your CDGS application is invoked as a DOS process so this requirement generally should cause you no concern. You just need to be aware of this requirement should you create an EXEC task and try to invoke nonvolatile.library from that task. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
