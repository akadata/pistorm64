ULONG ObtainInfo(struct GlyphEngine *, Tag , ...); FUNCTION This function accepts a tagList whose tag field elements are valid for inquiry, and whose associated data fields are pointers to the destination in which to place the requested data. Tag items that refer to data indirectly (OT_Indirect is set) return pointers that may be allocated or cached by the library. This data must be treated as read-only data. When the application is done with the data acquired via ObtainInfoA, it must perform a ReleaseInfoA to allow the library to release the data. INPUTS engineHandle -- the handle acquired via OpenEngine . tagList -- a tagList containing OT_ tags valid for inquiry paired with the destination pointers for the inquiry results. All destinations are longwords, whether they are pointers or values, and regardless of whether the value could fit in a smaller variable. RESULT This function returns a zero success indication, or a non-zero error code. EXAMPLE ULONG pointSize; struct GlyphMap *glyph; ... if (!ObtainInfo(EngineHandle, OT_Glyph, &glyph, TAG_DONE)) { ... ReleaseInfo(EngineHandle, OT_Glyph, glyph, TAG_DONE); } SEE ALSO ReleaseInfoA() , diskfont/diskfonttag.h , diskfont/oterrors.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
