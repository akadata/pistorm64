intuition.library/MoveScreen ]" border=0> NAME MoveScreen -- Attempt to move the screen by the increments provided. SYNOPSIS MoveScreen( Screen , DeltaX, DeltaY ) A0 D0 D1 VOID MoveScreen( struct Screen *, WORD, WORD ); FUNCTION Moves the screen the specified increment, specified in screen pixel resolution coordinates. New for V36: Screen movement limits have been greatly relaxed, to support screen scrolling. In particular, negative values for screen LeftEdge and TopEdge may now be valid. If the DeltaX and DeltaY variables you specify would move the screen in a way that violates any restrictions, the screen will be moved as far as possible. You may examine the LeftEdge and TopEdge fields of the Screen structure after this function returns to see where the screen really ended up. INPUTS Screen = pointer to a Screen structure DeltaX = amount to move the screen on the x-axis Note that DeltaX no longer (V36) need be set to zero DeltaY = amount to move the screen on the y-axis Note that these coordinates are in the same resolution as the screen (such as HIRES or INTERLACE) RESULT None BUGS SEE ALSO ScreenPosition() , RethinkDisplay() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
