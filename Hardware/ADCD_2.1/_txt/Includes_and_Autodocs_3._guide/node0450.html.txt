locale.library/--rexxhost-- ]" border=0> HOST INTERFACE locale.library provides an ARexx function host interface that enables ARexx programs to take advantage of system localization. The functions provided by the interface are directly related to the functions described herein, with the differences mostly being in the way they are called. The function host library vector is located at offset -30 from the library. This is the value you provide to ARexx in the AddLib() function call.
