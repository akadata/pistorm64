bullet.library/OpenEngine ]" border=0> NAME OpenEngine -- Acquire engine handle SYNOPSIS engineHandle = OpenEngine() struct GlyphEngine *OpenEngine(void) FUNCTION This function establishes a context for access to the bullet library. This context remains valid until it is closed via CloseEngine . Each specific context isolates the specification of the various font attributes from other contexts concurrently accessing the bullet library. A context can be shared among different tasks. RESULT This function returns an engineHandle, or NULL if for some reason no engineHandle can be created. EXAMPLE BulletBase = OpenLibrary("bullet.library", 0); if (!BulletBase) EndGame(ERROR_LibOpen, "bullet.library", 0); EngineHandle = OpenEngine(); if (!EngineHandle) EndGame(ERROR_InternalCall, "OpenEngine"); SEE ALSO CloseEngine() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
