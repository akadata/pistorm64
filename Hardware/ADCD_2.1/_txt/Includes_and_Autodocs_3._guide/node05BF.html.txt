workbench.library/CloseWorkbenchObjectAorkbench.library/CloseWorkbenchObjectA ]" border=0> NAME CloseWorkbenchObjectA -- Close a drawer as if the user had clicked on the window close gadget. (V44) SYNOPSIS success = CloseWorkbenchObjectA(name,tags) D0 A0 A1 BOOL CloseWorkbenchObjectA(STRPTR name,struct TagItem *tags); success = CloseWorkbenchObject(name,...); BOOL CloseWorkbenchObject(STRPTR name,...); FUNCTION This routine attempts to close the named object as if the user had clicked on its drawer window close gadget. INPUTS name -- Name of the drawer to be closed. tags -- Additional options. TAGS No tags are defined yet (V44). RESULTS result -- FALSE if the object in question could not be closed, TRUE otherwise. If FALSE is returned, you can query the error code using dos.library/IoErr() . EXAMPLE /* Close the drawer "SYS:" */ CloseWorkbenchObjectA("SYS:",NULL); NOTES The name of the drawer to be closed is interpreted relative to the current directory of the program to call CloseWorkbenchObjectA(). For this function call to succeed, Workbench must be open. This means that the LoadWB command was executed and the Workbench screen has been opened. While the user is dragging icons, no on-screen rendering may take place. In this state Workbench may refuse to execute the CloseWorkbenchObject() call and return an error code instead (ERROR_OBJECT_IN_USE).
