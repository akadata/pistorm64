utility.library/UMult32 ]" border=0> NAME UMult32 -- unsigned 32 by 32 bit multiply with 32 bit result. (V36) SYNOPSIS result = UMult32(arg1,arg2); D0 D0 D1 ULONG UMult32(ULONG,ULONG); FUNCTION Returns the unsigned 32 bit result of multiplying arg1 by arg2. INPUTS arg1, arg2 - numbers to multiply RESULTS result - the unsigned 32 bit result of multiplying arg1 by arg2. NOTES Unlike other Amiga library function calls, the utility.library 32 bit math routines do NOT require A6 to be loaded with a pointer to the library base. A6 can contain anything the application wishes. This is in order to avoid overhead in calling them. In addition, the utility.library math routines preserve all address registers including A0 and A1 SEE ALSO SDivMod32() , SMult32() , UDivMod32() , SMult64() , UMult64() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
