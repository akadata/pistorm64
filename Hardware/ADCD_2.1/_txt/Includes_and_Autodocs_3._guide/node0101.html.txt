TITLE: console.device/CMD_READ

console.device/CMD_READ ]" border=0> NAME CMD_READ -- return the next input from the keyboard FUNCTION Read the next input, generally from the keyboard. The form of this input is as an ANSI byte stream: i.e. either ASCII text or control sequences. Raw input events received by the console device can be selectively filtered via the aSRE and aRRE control sequences (see the write command). Keys are converted via the keymap associated with the unit, which is modified with AskKeyMap and SetKeyMap If, for example, raw keycodes had been enabled by writing 1{ to the console (where is $9B or Esc[), keys would return raw keycode reports with the information from the input event itself, in the form: 1;0; ; ;0;0; ; q If there is no pending input, this command will not be satisfied, but if there is some input, but not as much as can fill io_Length, the request will be satisfied with the input currently available. IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice io_Command CMD_READ io_Flags IOF_QUICK if quick I/O possible, else zero io_Length sizeof(*buffer) io_Data char buffer[] a pointer to the destination for the characters to read from the keyboard. RESULTS This function sets the error field in the IOStdReq , and fills in the io_Data area with the next input, and io_Actual with the number of bytes read.
