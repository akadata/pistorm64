utility.library/Stricmp ]" border=0> NAME Stricmp -- case-insensitive string comparison. (V37) SYNOPSIS result = Stricmp(string1,string2); D0 A0 A1 LONG Stricmp(STRPTR,STRPTR); FUNCTION This function compares two strings, ignoring case using a generic case conversion routine. If the strings have different lengths, the shorter is treated as if it were extended with zeros. INPUTS string1, string2 - strings to be compared RESULTS result - relationship between string1 and string2 0 means string1 > string2 NOTES Whenever locale.library is installed in a system, this function is replaced by language-specific code. This means that depending on which language the user has currently selected, identical pairs of strings may return different values when passed to this function. This fact must be taken into consideration when using this function. SEE ALSO Strnicmp() , locale.library/StrnCmp() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
