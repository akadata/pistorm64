serial.device/SDCMD_BREAK ]" border=0> NAME Break -- send a break signal over the serial line FUNCTION This command sends a break signal (serial line held low for an extended period) out the serial port. For the built-in port, This is accomplished by setting the UARTBRK bit of regisrer ADKCON. After a duration (user specifiable via setparams, default 250000 microseconds) the bit is reset and the signal discontinued. If the QUEUEDBRK bit of io_SerFlags is set in the io_Request block, the request is placed at the back of the write-request queue and executed in turn. If the QUEUEDBRK bit is not set, the break is started immediately, control returns to the caller, and the timer discontinues the signal after the duration is completed. Be aware that calling BREAK may affect other commands such as ABORT, FLUSH, STOP, START, etc... IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort initialized io_Device set by OpenDevice io_Unit set by OpenDevice io_Command SDCMD_BREAK io_Flags set/reset IO_QUICK per above description RESULTS Error -- if the Break succeded, then Error will be null. If the Break failed, then the Error will be non-zero. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
