datatypes.library/NewDTObjectA ]" border=0> NAME NewDTObjectA - Create an data type object. (V39) SYNOPSIS o = NewDTObjectA (name, attrs); d0 d0 a0 Object *NewDTObjectA (APTR, struct TagItem *); o = NewDTObject (name, tag1, ...); Object *NewDTObject (APTR, Tag tag1, ...); FUNCTION This is the method for creating datatype objects from 'boopsi' classes. Boopsi' stands for "basic object-oriented programming system for Intuition".) You further specify initial "create-time" attributes for the object via a TagItem list, and they are applied to the resulting datatype object that is returned. INPUTS name - Name of the data source. Usually an existing file name. attrs - Pointer to a taglist containing additional arguments. TAGS DTA_SourceType - Specify the type of source data; such as coming from a file or clipboard (defaults to DTST_FILE). If source type is clipboard, then the name field contains the numeric clipboard unit. If source type is DTST_MEMORY, the name field will be ignored (V44). DTA_Handle - Can optionally be used instead of the name field. Must be a valid FileHandle if DTA_SourceType is DTST_FILE. Must be a valid IFFHandle if DTA_SourceType is DTST_CLIPBOARD. Will be ignored if DTA_SourceType is DTST_MEMORY. DTA_DataType - Specify the class of data. Data is a pointer to a valid DataType . This is only used when attempting to create a new object that doesn't have any source data. DTA_GroupID - Specify that the object must be of this type, or NewDTObject() will fail with IoErr() of ERROR_OBJECT_WRONG_TYPE. DTA_SourceAddress (APTR) -- For DTST_MEMORY source data, this specifies the memory address at which the source data is located. This must be non-NULL. This attribute is required for DTST_MEMORY source data (V44). DTA_SourceSize (ULONG) -- For DTST_MEMORY source data, this specifies the size of the source data (in bytes). This must be greater than 0. This attribute is required for DTST_MEMORY source data (V44). GA_Left, GA_RelRight, GA_Top, GA_RelBottom, GA_Width, GA_RelWidth, GA_Height, GA_RelHeight - Specify the placement of the object within the destination window. GA_ID - Specify the object ID. GA_UserData - Specify the application specific data for the object. RETURNS A boopsi object, which may be used in different contexts such as a gadget or image, and may be manipulated by generic functions. You eventually free the object using DisposeDTObject() . A NULL return indicates failure. Use IoErr() to get error value. Following is a summary of the error number used and there meaning as it relates to DataTypes. ERROR_REQUIRED_ARG_MISSING - Indicates that a required attribute wasn't passed in. ERROR_BAD_NUMBER - An invalid group ID was passed in. ERROR_OBJECT_WRONG_TYPE - Object data type doesn't match DTA_GroupID. ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE - Not enough memory. DTERROR_UNKNOWN_DATATYPE - Unable to open the class library associated with the data type. DTERROR_COULDNT_OPEN - Unable to open the data object. ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED - Unknown handle type. NOTES This function invokes the OM_NEW "method" for the class specified. The DTST_MEMORY source type introduced in V44 makes in-memory data available to subclasses as if the data were stored in a file. Thus, subclasses will see the data as DTST_FILE. Since the data does not correspond to an on-disk file, subclasses and examine hook code must not assume that they will be able to reopen the "file" whose data has been provided to them. EXAMPLE STRPTR fileName = "s:startup-sequence" Object *o; /* Simplest use is to just open an existing file */ if (o = NewDTObject ((APTR)fileName, NULL)) { /* Free the object when we are done with it */ DisposeDTObject (o); } SEE ALSO AddDTObject() , DisposeDTObject() , RemoveDTObject() , intuition.library/NewObjectA() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
