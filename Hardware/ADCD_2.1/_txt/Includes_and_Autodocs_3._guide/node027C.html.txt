gadtools.library/GT_BeginRefresh ]" border=0> NAME GT_BeginRefresh -- begin refreshing friendly to GadTools. (V36) SYNOPSIS GT_BeginRefresh(win) A0 VOID GT_BeginRefresh(struct Window *); FUNCTION Invokes the intuition.library/BeginRefresh() function in a manner friendly to the Gadget Toolkit. This function call permits the GadTools gadgets to refresh themselves at the correct time. Call GT_EndRefresh() function when done. INPUTS win - pointer to Window structure for which a IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW IDCMP event was received. NOTES The nature of GadTools precludes the use of the IDCMP flag WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH. You must handle IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW events in at least the minimal way, namely: case IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW: GT_BeginRefresh(win); GT_EndRefresh(win, TRUE); break; SEE ALSO intuition.library/BeginRefresh() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
