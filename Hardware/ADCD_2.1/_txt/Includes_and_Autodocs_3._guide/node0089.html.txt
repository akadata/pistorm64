bullet.library/ReleaseInfoA ]" border=0> NAME ReleaseInfoA -- Release data obtained with ObtainInfoA ReleaseInfo -- varargs form of ReleaseInfoA SYNOPSIS error = ReleaseInfoA(engineHandle, tagList) A0 A1 ULONG ReleaseInfoA(struct GlyphEngine *, struct TagItem *); error = ReleaseInfo(engineHandle, firstTag, ...) ULONG ReleaseInfo(struct GlyphEngine *, Tag , ...); FUNCTION This function releases the data obtained with ObtainInfoA . Data associated with tags that are not indirect, i.e. for which OT_Indirect is not set, need not be released, but it is not an error to do so. Released data may be immediately freed or may become a candidate to be expunged from memory when the system reaches a low memory condition, depending on the library's internal implementation. Each ReleaseInfoA tag item must be associated with a prior ObtainInfoA . INPUTS engineHandle -- the handle acquired via OpenEngine . tagList -- a tagList containing OT_ tags valid for inquiry paired with the data previously acquired for them with ObtainInfoA . Null pointers quietly accepted and ignored for indirect data. RESULT This function has no result. The only error that can occur is when the Obtain and Release pairs are mismatched: the application is assumed not to do that. EXAMPLE ULONG pointSize; struct GlyphMap *glyph; ... error = ObtainInfo(EngineHandle, OT_Glyph, &glyph, TAG_DONE); ... ReleaseInfo(EngineHandle, OT_Glyph, glyph, TAG_DONE); SEE ALSO ReleaseInfoA(), diskfont/diskfonttag.h , diskfont/oterrors.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
