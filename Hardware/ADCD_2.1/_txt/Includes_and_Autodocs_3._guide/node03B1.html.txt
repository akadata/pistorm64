intuition.library/FreeScreenBuffer ]" border=0> NAME FreeScreenBuffer -- Free a ScreenBuffer structure. (V39) SYNOPSIS FreeScreenBuffer( Screen , ScreenBuffer ) A0 A1 VOID FreeScreenBuffer( struct Screen *, struct ScreenBuffer * ); FUNCTION Frees a ScreenBuffer structure you got from AllocScreenBuffer() , and releases associated resources. You must call FreeScreenBuffer() before you close your screen. INPUTS Screen: pointer to the screen this ScreenBuffer is associated with. ScreenBuffer: pointer to a ScreenBuffer structure obtained from AllocScreenBuffer() . It is safe to call this function with a NULL argument. It will have no effect. RESULT None. NOTES Originally, FreeScreenBuffer() did not WaitBlit() before freeing a BitMap . The intent was that the application should do this. However, as this sort of thing is easily forgotten, WaitBlit() was added in V40. Application writers should ensure that freeing the buffer is safe by calling WaitBlit() themselves. The SB_SCREEN_BITMAP flag instructs AllocScreenBuffer() to provide a ScreenBuffer referring to the screen's actual bitmap. When you are done changing screen buffers, you must FreeScreenBuffer() the currently-installed ScreenBuffer before you close the screen. Intuition will recognize when FreeScreenBuffer() is called for the currently-installed ScreenBuffer , and will know to free the supporting structures but not the BitMap . CloseScreen() will take care of that. BUGS SEE ALSO AllocScreenBuffer() , ChangeScreenBuffer() , graphics.library/ChangeVPBitMap() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
