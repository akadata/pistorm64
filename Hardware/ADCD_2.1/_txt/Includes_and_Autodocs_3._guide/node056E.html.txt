This class also supports window relativity. This class is a subclass of rom strgclass which automatically creates a field bevel and supports GM_DOMAIN for layout groups. METHODS OM_NEW -- Passed to superclass, strgclass allocated, then OM_SET. OM_SET -- Passed to superclass, and strgclass is set. OM_UPDATE -- Passed to superclass, and strgclass is set then rendered. OM_DISPOSE -- Disposes strgclass object, then passed to superclass. GM_RENDER -- Passed to superclass, then strgclass object GM_HITTEST -- Overrides supperclass, returns GMR_HITTEST. GM_GOACTIVE -- Passed to superclass, strgclass, string activated GM_HANDLEINPUT -- Routes input to strgclass object. GM_GOINACTIVE -- Passed to superclass, strgclass, string deactivated. GM_DOMAIN -- Returns GDOMAIN_MINIMUM, GDOMAIN_NOMINAL and GDOMAIN_MAXIMUM dimensions. ATTRIBUTES GA_Disabled (BOOL) Determines whether the string is disabled or not. Changing disable state will invoke GM_RENDER. A disabled string is dusted in a ghosting pattern that is rendered in SHADOWPEN. Defaults to FALSE. Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE) GA_TextAttr (struct TextAttr *) Text attribute for the font to use for the string. Defaults to RPort->Font, which is often the screen or window font. Applicability is (OM_NEW) GA_ReadOnly (BOOL) Read-only gadgets ignore activation attempts. Defaults to FALSE. Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE) STRINGA_MinVisible (WORD) (V41) Set the minimum number of characters that should be visible for a 'GDOMAIN_MIMIMUM' domain size. Nominal domain sizes to twice this minimum. This is a handy addition (also present in V40.35) to ensure a mimimum number characters will be visible in a string gadget. Defaults to 4. Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE) NOTES The string class passes all tags to its strgclass child, please see strgclass tags & autodocs, and look in for the STRINGA_ tags. WARNING: string.gadget is ROM strgclass wrapper, depending on string.gadget version. Passing GA_Text can crash strgclass, please use STRING_TextVal as its intended. STRINGA_Font and STRINGA_LongVal are not directly supported, for numeric strings use our more powerful integer.gadget class. To specify the font for the gadget, use GA_TextAttr which is consistant with all other ReAction gadget attributes. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
