SYNOPSIS WriteExpansionByte( board, offset, byte ) A0 D0 D1 FUNCTION (Not typically called by user code) WriteExpansionByte writes a byte to a new-style expansion board. These boards have their writeable data organized as a series of nybbles in memory. This routine writes two nybbles in a very careful manner to work with all types of new expansion boards. To make certain types of board less expensive, an expansion board's write registers may be organized as either a byte-wide or nybble-wide register. If it is nybble-wide then it must latch the less significant nybble until the more significant nybble is written. This allows the following algorithm to work with either type of board: write the low order nybble to bits D15-D12 of byte (offset*4)+2 write the entire byte to bits D15-D8 of byte (offset*4) The offset is a byte offset into a ExpansionRom structure. The actual memory address read will be four times larger. The macros EROFFSET and ECOFFSET are provided to help get these offsets from C. INPUTS board - a pointer to the base of a new style expansion board. offset - a logical offset from the configdev base byte - the byte of data to be written to the expansion board.
