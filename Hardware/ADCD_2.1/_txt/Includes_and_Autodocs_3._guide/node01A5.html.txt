The entry removed is the first one for which SameLock with 'lock' returns that they are on the same object. The lock for the entry in the list is unlocked (not the entry passed in). INPUTS name - Name of device to remove lock from (without trailing ':') lock - Lock associated with the object to remove from the list RESULT success - Success/failure indicator. BUGS In V36 through V39.23 dos, it would fail to remove the first lock in the assign. Fixed in V39.24 dos (after the V39.106 kickstart).
