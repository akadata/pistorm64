layers.library/LockLayer ]" border=0> NAME LockLayer -- Lock layer to make changes to ClipRects. SYNOPSIS LockLayer( dummy, l ) a0 a1 void LockLayer( LONG , struct Layer *); FUNCTION Make this layer unavailable for other tasks to use. If another task is already using this layer then wait for it to complete and then reserve the layer for your own use. (this function does the same thing as graphics.library/LockLayerRom) Note: if you wish to lock MORE THAN ONE layer at a time, you must call LockLayerInfo() before locking those layers and then call UnlockLayerInfo() when you have finished. This is to prevent system "deadlocks". Further Note: while you hold the lock on a layer, Intuition will block on operations such as windowsizing, dragging, menus, and depth arranging windows in this layer's screen. It is recommended that YOU do not make Intuition function calls while the layer is locked. INPUTS dummy - unused l - pointer to a layer BUGS SEE ALSO UnlockLayer() , LockLayerInfo() , UnlockLayerInfo() , graphics.library/LockLayerRom() , graphics/layers.h , graphics/clip.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
