This consists of a DeviceNode , a FileSysStartupMsg , a disk environment vector, and up to two bcpl strings. See the libraries/dosextens.h and libraries/filehandler.h include files for more information. MakeDosNode will allocate all the memory it needs, and then link the various structure together. It will make sure all the structures are long-word aligned (as required by the DOS). It then returns the information to the user so he can change anything else that needs changing. Typically he will then call AddDosNode() to enter the new device into the dos tables. INPUTS parameterPkt - a longword array containing all the information needed to initialize the data structures. Normally I would have provided a structure for this, but the variable length of the packet caused problems. The two strings are null terminated strings, like all other exec strings. longword description -------- ----------- 0 string with dos handler name 1 string with exec device name 2 unit number (for OpenDevice) 3 flags (for OpenDevice) 4 # of longwords in rest of environment 5-n file handler environment (see libraries/filehandler.h) RESULTS deviceNode - pointer to initialize device node structure, or null if there was not enough memory. You may need to change certain fields before passing the DeviceNode to AddDosNode() .
