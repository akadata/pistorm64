(V36) SYNOPSIS RPort = ObtainGIRPort( GInfo ) D0 A0 struct RastPort *ObtainGIRPort( struct GadgetInfo * ); FUNCTION Sets up a RastPort for use (only) by custom gadget hook routines. This function must be called EACH time a hook routine needing to perform gadget rendering is called, and must be accompanied by a corresponding call to ReleaseGIRPort() . Note that if a hook function passes you a RastPort pointer, e.g., GM_RENDER, you needn't call ObtainGIRPort() in that case. INPUTS A pointer to a GadgetInfo structure, as passed to each custom gadget hook function. RESULT A pointer to a RastPort that may be used for gadget rendering. This pointer may be NULL, in which case you should do no rendering. You may (optionally) pass a null return value to ReleaseGIRPort() .
