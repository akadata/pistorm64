(V39) ObtainBestPen --- varargs stub for ObtainBestPenA SYNOPSIS color | -1 =ObtainBestPenA( cm, R, G, B, taglist) a0 d1 d2 d3 a1 LONG ObtainBestPenA( struct ColorMap *, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, struct TagItem *); color = ObtainBestPen(cm,r,g,b,tags....); INPUTS cm = colormap R = red level (32 bit left justified fraction) G = green level (32 bit left justified fraction) B = blue level (32 bit left justified fraction) taglist = a pointer to a standard tag list specifying the color matching settings desired: OBP_Precision - specifies the desired precision for the match. Should be PRECISION_GUI, PRECISION_ICON, or PRECISION_IMAGE or PRECISION_EXACT. Defaults to PRECISION_IMAGE. OBP_FailIfBad - specifies that you want ObtainBestPen to return a failure value if there is not a color within the given tolerance, instead of returning the closest color. With OBP_FailIfBad==FALSE, ObtainBestPen will only fail if the ViewPort contains no sharable colors. Defaults to FALSE. FUNCTION This function can be used by applications to figure out what pen to use to represent a given color. The system will attempt to find the color in your viewport closest to the specified color. If there is no color within your tolerance, then a new one will be allocated, if available. If none is available, then the closest one found will be returned. RESULT The correct pen value, or -1 if no sharable palette entries are available. BUGS NOTES If this call succceeds, then you must call ReleasePen() when you are done with the color. The error metric used for ObtainBestPen() is based on the magnitude squared between the two RGB values, scaled by the percentage of free entries.
