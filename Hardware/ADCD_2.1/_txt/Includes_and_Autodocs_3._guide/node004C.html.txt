SYNOPSIS result = SetSuperAttrs( cl, obj, tag, ... ) ULONG SetSuperAttrs( struct IClass *, Object *, ULONG, ... ); FUNCTION Boopsi support function which invokes the OM_SET method on the superclass of the supplied class for the supplied object. Allows the ops_AttrList to be supplied on the stack (i.e. in a varargs way). The equivalent non-varargs function would simply be DoSuperMethod( cl, obj, OM_SET, taglist, NULL ); INPUTS cl - pointer to boopsi class whose superclass is to receive the OM_SET message obj - pointer to boopsi object tag - list of tag-attribute pairs, ending in TAG_DONE RESULT result - class and message-specific result. NOTES This function first appears in the V37 release of amiga.lib. While it intrinsically does not require any particular release of the system software to operate, it is designed to work with the boopsi subsystem of Intuition, which was only introduced in V36.
