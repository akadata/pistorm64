graphics.library/InitArea ]" border=0> NAME InitArea -- Initialize vector collection matrix SYNOPSIS InitArea( areainfo, buffer, maxvectors ) a0 a1 d0 void InitArea(struct AreaInfo *, void *, SHORT); FUNCTION This function provides initialization for the vector collection matrix such that it has a size of (max vectors ). The size of the region pointed to by buffer (short pointer) should be five (5) times as large as maxvectors. This size is in bytes. Areafills done by using AreaMove , AreaDraw , and AreaEnd must have enough space allocated in this table to store all the points of the largest fill. AreaEllipse takes up two vectors for every call. If AreaMove/Draw/Ellipse detect too many vectors going into the buffer they will return -1. INPUTS areainfo - pointer to AreaInfo structure buffer - pointer to chunk of memory to collect vertices maxvectors - max number of vectors this buffer can hold RESULT Pointers are set up to begin storage of vectors done by AreaMove , AreaDraw , and AreaEllipse .
