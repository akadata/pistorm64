SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrs(node, firsttag, ...) VOID SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA(struct Node *, struct TagItem *) SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA(node, taglist) FUNCTION Changes attributes for a SpeedBar node. Since the SpeedBar class uses a private node structure, this is the only way to change node attributes. You may NOT change node attributes when the node is in a list attached to a SpeedBar gadget. You must first detach the list with SPEEDBAR_Labels, ~0 before you can change attributes, and then re-attach the list.
