realtime.library/ExternalSync ]" border=0> NAME ExternalSync -- provide external source clock for a player's conductor. (V37) SYNOPSIS result = ExternalSync(player, minTime, maxTime); D0 A0 D0 D1 BOOL ExternalSync(struct Player *, LONG , LONG); FUNCTION Allows external applications to constrain conductor time between minTime and maxTime, with the restraint that time can never run backwards. Does nothing if the given player is not the current External Sync source. INPUTS player - player referencing the conductor to change minTime, maxTime - time constraints RESULTS result - TRUE if everything went OK, FALSE if the player is not the current sync source or there is no conductor for the player.
