card.resource/OwnCard ]" border=0> NAME OwnCard -- Own credit card registers, and memory SYNOPSIS return = OwnCard( handle ) d0 a1 struct CardHandle *OwnCard( struct CardHandle * ); FUNCTION This function is used to obtain immediate, or deferred ownership of a credit-card in the credit-card slot. Typically an EXEC STYLE DEVICE will be written to interface between an application, and a credit card in the slot. While applications, and libraries can attempt to own a credit-card in the card slot, the rest of this documentation assumes a device interface will be used. Because credit-cards can be inserted, or removed by the user at any time (otherwise known as HOT-INSERTION, and HOT-REMOVAL), the card.resource provides devices with a protocol which lets many devices bid for ownership of a newly inserted card. In general, devices should support HOT-REMOVAL, however there are legitimate cases where HOT-REMOVAL is not practical. For these cases this function allows you to own the resource using the CARDB_RESETREMOVE flag. If the card is removed before your device calls ReleaseCard() , the machine will RESET . INPUTS handle - pointer to a CardHandle structure. struct CardHandle { struct Node cah_CardNode; struct Interrupt *cah_CardRemoved; struct Interrupt *cah_CardInserted; struct Interrupt *cah_CardStatus; UBYTE cah_CardFlags; }; The following fields in the structure must be filled in by the application before calling OwnCard() - cah_CardNode.ln_Pri - See table below. The Node field is used by the resource to add your handle to a sorted list of CardHandle structures. This list is used by the resource to notify devices when the device owns the credit-card. Your device will only be notified (at most) one time per card insertion, and perhaps less often if some higher priority device on the notification list retains ownership of a card in the slot. Priority Comments -------------------------------------------------- >= 21 Reserved for future use 10-20 To be used by third party devices (e.g., I/O CARD manufacturers) which look for specific card tuples to identify credit-cards. 01-19 Reserved for future use 00 To be used by general purpose devices which have loose card specification requirements. CardHandle structure. cah_CardNode.ln_Name - Must be initialized to NULL, or name of device which owns this structure. cah_CardRemoved - Pointer to an initialized interrupt structure. Only the is_Data, and is_Code fields need to be initialized. This is the interrupt code which will be called when a credit-card which your device owns is removed. Once you receive this interrupt, all credit-card interface control registers are reset (e.g., programming voltage, access speed, etc.), and you should stop accessing the card as soon as possible. Because your code is called on interrupt time, you should do the least amount possible, and use little stack space. This pointer can be NULL if you have asked for reset on card-removal, and you never turn reset off. cah_ CardInserted - Pointer to an initialized interrupt structure. Only the is_Data, and is_Code fields need to be initialized. This is the code which will be called when your CardHandle owns the credit-card in the slot. Note that your code may be called on the context of an interrupt, or a task in FORBID, therefore you should do the least amount possible, and use little stack space. Note that it is possible to receive a card removed interrupt immediately before you receive this interrupt if the card is removed while your CardInserted interrupt is being called. Your device owns the credit-card until the card is manually removed by the user, or you release the card by calling ReleaseCard() . Your device should examine the card in the slot (e.g., look for specific tuples), and decide if the card is of a type your device understands. If not, release ownership of the card by calling ReleaseCard() so that other devices will be given a chance to examine the current card in the credit-card slot. cah_CardStatus - Pointer to an initialized interrupt structure. Only the is_Data, and is_Code fields need to be initialized. Note that your code will be called on the context of an interrupt, therefore you should do the least amount possible, and use little stack space. Note that it is possible to receive a card removed interrupt immediately before you receive this interrupt if the card is removed during this interrupt. If this pointer is NULL, you will not receive card status change interrupts. Your interrupt code will be called with a mask value in register D0, and a pointer to your data in A1. The mask value in D0 can be interpreted using the same bit definitions returned by ReadCardStatus() . Note that more than one bit may be set, and the mask only tells you what has changed, not the current state. Use ReadCardStatus() if you need to determine the current state of the status bits. Not all status change interrupts will necessarily be enabled on all systems. For example, on some systems BVD2/DA status change interrupts will not be enabled so that digital audio can occur without generating many interrupts. Status change interrupts are typically meant to be used for monitoring BSY/IRQ, WR, and BVD1/SC. Battery voltage low detection would best be done by a separate utility which periodically polls BVD1 & BVD2 by using the ReadCardStatus() function. Typically the mask value in D0 MUST be returned unchanged on exit from your code. The return value in D0 is then used to clear the source(s) of the interrupt. In the rare case that you need to keep a status change interrupt active, clear the appropriate bit(s) in D0 before returning via RTS. Clear no bits other than those defined as valid bits for ReadCardStatus()! !!!NEW FOR V39!!! See definition of CARDB_POSTSTATUS below. cah_CardFlags - Optional flags (all other bits must be 0). - CARDB_RESETREMOVE means you want the machine to reset if the credit-card in the slot is removed while you own the credit-card. - CARDB_IFAVAILABLE means you only want ownership of the credit-card in the slot if it is immediately available. If it is available, your CardHandle structure will be added to a list so that you can be notified via an interrupt when the credit-card is removed by the user. If the credit-card is not immediately available (either because there is no credit-card in the slot, or because some other device owns the credit-card), your CardHandle structure will NOT be added to the notification list. - CARDB_DELAYOWNERSHIP means you never want a successful return from OwnCard() even if the credit-card is available. Rather you will be notified of ownership via your cah_CardInserted interrupt. If you use this flag, OwnCard() will always return -1. This flag cannot be used with the CARDB_IFAVAILABLE flag. - CARDB_POSTSTATUS is new for V39 card.resource (check resource base VERSION before using). It is meant to be used by drivers which want to service the card hardware AFTER the status change interrupt has been cleared on the gate array. Previously a PORTS interrupt server had to be added to do this; this is somewhat more efficient, and easier to use. Your status change interrupt is first called with status change bits in register D0. You would examine these bits, and set a flag(s) for the POST callback. When you return from the status change interrupt, the interrupt on the gate array is cleared (based on what you return in register D0), and your status change interrupt is immediately called again, but this time with 0 in D0. The value you return in D0 for the POST callback case is ignored. ALL other fields are used by the resource, and no fields in the structure may be modified while the structure is in use by the resource. If you need to make changes, you must remove your CardHandle (see ReleaseCard() ), make the changes, and then call OwnCard() again. RESULTS 0 - indicates success, your device owns the credit card. -1 - indicates that the card cannot be owned (most likely because there is no card in the credit card slot). ptr - indicates failure. Returns pointer to the CardHandle structure which owns the credit card. NOTES This function should only be called from a task. CardHandle interrupts are called with a pointer to your data in A1, and a pointer to your code in A5. With the exception of status change interrupts, D0-D1, A0-A1, and A5-A6 may be treated as scratch registers. Status change interrupts are also called with meaningful data in D0, and expect D0 be preserved upon RTS from your code. No other registers are guaranteed to contain initialized data. All other registers must be preserved. SEE ALSO ReleaseCard() , ReadCardStatus() , resources/card.i, resources/card.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
