(V36) SYNOPSIS DisposeObject( Object ) A0 VOID DisposeObject( APTR ); FUNCTION Deletes a boopsi object and all of it auxiliary data. These objects are all created by NewObject() .

INPUTS Object = abstract pointer to a boopsi object returned by NewObject() . The pointer may be NULL, in which case this function has no effect. NOTES This function invokes the OM_DISPOSE method. RESULT None. BUGS SEE ALSO NewObject() , SetAttrs(), GetAttr() , MakeClass() , Document "Basic Object-Oriented Programming System for Intuition" and the "boopsi Class Reference" document.
