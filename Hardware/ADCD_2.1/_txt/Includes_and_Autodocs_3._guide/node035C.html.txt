iffparse.library/CloseIFF ]" border=0> NAME CloseIFF -- close an IFF context. (V36) SYNOPSIS CloseIFF(iff); A0 VOID CloseIFF(struct IFFHandle *); FUNCTION Completes an IFF read or write operation by closing the IFF context established for this IFFHandle structure. The IFFHandle structure itself is left ready for re-use and a new context can be opened with OpenIFF() . This function can be used for cleanup if a read or write fails partway through. As part of its cleanup operation, CloseIFF() calls the client- supplied stream hook vector. The IFFStreamCmd packet will be set as follows: sc_Command: IFFCMD_CLEANUP sc_Buf: (Not applicable) sc_NBytes: (Not applicable) This operation is NOT permitted to fail; any error code returned will be ignored (best to return 0, though). DO NOT write to this structure. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle structure previously opened with OpenIFF() . Starting with V39, this may be NULL.
