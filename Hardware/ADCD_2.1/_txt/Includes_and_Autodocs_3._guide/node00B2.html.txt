cd.device/CD_READ ]" border=0> NAME CD_READ -- read data from disk. FUNCTION Reads data from the CD into memory. Data may be accessed on WORD boundaries (you are not restricted to sector boundaries as with normal disk devices). Data lengths can also be described in WORD amounts. IO REQUEST INPUT io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command CD_READ io_Data pointer to the buffer where the data should be put io_Length number of bytes to read, must be a WORD multiple. io_Offset byte offset from the start of the disk describing where to read data from, must be a WORD multiple. IO REQUEST RESULT io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in io_Actual - if io_Error is 0, number of bytes actually transferred NOTES If an error occurs when attempting a CD_READ, the software will retry up to 10 times before giving up on the request. If the drive is in double-speed and an error occurs, the software will retry once more in double-speed, and if this fails, will retry the next 9 times in single-speed.
