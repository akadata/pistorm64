(V37) SYNOPSIS player = CreatePlayerA(tagList); D0 A0 struct Player *CreatePlayerA(struct TagItem *); player = CreatePlayer(firstTag, ...); struct Player *CreatePlayer(Tag, ...); FUNCTION Creates a player structure with the desired attributes. INPUTS tagList - pointer to an array of tags providing optional extra parameters, or NULL TAGS PLAYER_Name (STRPTR) - name of the player (generally the application's name). Default is no name. (V37) PLAYER_Hook (struct Hook *) - function to call when time changes occur. Default is no function. The Hook is called with: A0 - address of Hook structure A1 - message, currently pmTime or pmState A2 - address of Player structure Note that your hook function is not necessarily called TICK_FREQ times per second. This is the maximum number of times it can be called. (V37) PLAYER_Priority (BYTE) - priority for the player, from -128 to +127. Default is 0. (V37) PLAYER_Conductor (STRPTR) - name of the conductor to link with. If this conductor doesn't exist, it is created automatically. If ~0 is passed, creates a private conductor. (V37) PLAYER_Ready (BOOL) - set/clear the "ready" flag. Default is FALSE. (V37) PLAYER_AlarmTime (LONG) - sets this player's alarm time, and the PLAYERF_ALARMSET flag. (V37) PLAYER_Alarm (BOOL) - if TRUE sets the PLAYERF_ALARMSET flag, FALSE clears the flag. Default is FALSE. (V37) PLAYER_AlarmSigTask (struct Task *) - task to signal on notify or alarm. Default is no task. Having no task automatically forces the PLAYERF_ALARMSET flag off. (V37) PLAYER_AlarmSigBit (BYTE) - signal bit to use on alarm or -1 to disable. Default is -1. Having a signal bit of -1 automatically forces the PLAYERF_ALARMSET flag off. (V37) PLAYER_Quiet (BOOL) - when TRUE, this player is ignored. Mainly used by external sync applications. Default is FALSE. (V37) PLAYER_UserData (VOID *) - sets the player's UserData value. Default is NULL. (V37) PLAYER_ID (UWORD) - sets the player's ID value. Default is 0. (V37) PLAYER_Conducted (BOOL) - if TRUE sets the PLAYERF_CONDUCTED flag, FALSE clears the flag. Default is FALSE. (V37) PLAYER_ExtSync (BOOL) - if TRUE, attempts to become external sync source. (V37) PLAYER_ErrorCode (LONG *) - optional pointer to a longword which will receive an error code whenever this function fails. Possible error values currently include: RTE_NOMEMORY - memory allocation failed RTE_NOTIMER - timer (CIA) allocation failed RESULTS player - a pointer to a Player structure on success or NULL on failure. When NULL is returned, an error code can be returned in the longword variable pointed to by the optional PLAYER_ErrorCode tag.
