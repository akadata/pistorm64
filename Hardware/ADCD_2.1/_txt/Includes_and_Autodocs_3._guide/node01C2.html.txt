dos.library/StartNotify ]" border=0> NAME StartNotify -- Starts notification on a file or directory (V36) SYNOPSIS success = StartNotify(notifystructure) D0 D1 BOOL StartNotify(struct NotifyRequest *) FUNCTION Posts a notification request. Do not modify the notify structure while it is active. You will be notified when the file or directory changes. For files, you will be notified after the file is closed. Not all filesystems will support this: applications should NOT require it. In particular, most network filesystems won't support it. INPUTS notifystructure - A filled-in NotifyRequest structure RESULT success - Success/failure of request BUGS The V36 floppy/HD filesystem doesn't actually send notifications. The V36 ram handler (ram:) does. This has been fixed for V37. SEE ALSO EndNotify() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
