exec.library/WaitIO ]" border=0> NAME WaitIO -- wait for completion of an I/O request SYNOPSIS error = WaitIO(iORequest) D0 A1 BYTE WaitIO(struct IORequest *); FUNCTION This function waits for the specified I/O request to complete, then removes it from the replyport. If the I/O has already completed, this function will return immediately. This function should be used with care, as it does not return until the I/O request completes; if the I/O never completes, this function will never return, and your task will hang. If this situation is a possibility, it is safer to use the Wait() function. Wait() will return return when any of a specified set of signal is received. This is how I/O timeouts can be properly handled. WARNING If this IORequest was "Quick" or otherwise finished BEFORE this call, this function drops though immediately, with no call to Wait() . A side effect is that the signal bit related the port may remain set. Expect this. When removing a known complete IORequest from a port, WaitIO() is the preferred method. A simple Remove() would require a Disable/Enable pair! INPUTS iORequest - pointer to an I/O request block RESULTS error - zero if successful, else an error is returned (a sign extended copy of io_Error).
