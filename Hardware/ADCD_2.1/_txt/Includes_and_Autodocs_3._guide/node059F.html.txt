(V39) SYNOPSIS object = FindNamedObject(nameSpace, name, lastObject); D0 A0 A1 A2 struct NamedObject *FindNamedObject(struct NamedObject *, STRPTR , struct NamedObject *); FUNCTION Finds an object and adds to the open count of the object. The object is guaranteed not to be freed until ReleaseNamedObject() is called. The name comparison is caseless, using the current locale string comparison routines. If name is NULL, then all objects will be matched. If lastObject is non-NULL, it must be an object from the same NameSpace found on a previous call to FindNamedObject(). It will not be freed by this call. The search will start at the node after lastobject, if non-NULL. nameSpace is the name space from the named object given or the root name space if NULL is given. INPUTS nameSpace - the name space to search name - the name of the object to search for lastObject - the starting point for the search or NULL RESULT object - the first match found, or NULL for no match SEE ALSO ReleaseNamedObject() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
