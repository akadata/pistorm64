(V36) SYNOPSIS customObj = CxCustom(action,id); CxObj *CxCustom(LONG(*)(),LONG); FUNCTION This function creates a custom commodity object. The action of this object on receiving a commodity message is to call a function of the application programmer's choice. The function provided ('action') will be passed a pointer to the actual commodities message (in commodities private data space), and will actually execute as part of the input handler system task. Among other things, the value of 'id' can be recovered from the message by using the function CxMsgID() . The purpose of this function is two-fold. First, it allows programmers to create Commodities Exchange objects with functionality that was not imagined or chosen for inclusion by the designers. Secondly, this is the only way to act synchronously with Commodities. This function is a C-language macro for CreateCxObj() , defined in . INPUTS action - a function to call whenever a message reaches the object id - a message id to assign to the object RESULTS customObj - a pointer to the new custom object, or NULL if it could not be created.
