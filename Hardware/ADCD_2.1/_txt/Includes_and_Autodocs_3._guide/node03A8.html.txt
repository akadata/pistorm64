SYNOPSIS DrawBorder( RastPort , Border , LeftOffset, TopOffset ) A0 A1 D0 D1 VOID DrawBorder( struct RastPort *, struct Border *, WORD, WORD ); FUNCTION First, sets up the draw mode and pens in the RastPort according to the arguments of the Border structure. Then, draws the vectors of the border argument into the RastPort , offset by the left and top offsets. As with all graphics rendering routines, the border will be clipped to to the boundaries of the RastPort's layer, if it exists. This is the case with window RastPorts. This routine will draw all borders in the NULL-terminated list linked by the NextBorder field of the border argument. INPUTS RastPort = pointer to the RastPort to receive the border rendering Border = pointer to a Border structure LeftOffset = the offset to be added to each vector's x coordinate TopOffset = the offset to be added to each vector's y coordinate RESULT None BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
