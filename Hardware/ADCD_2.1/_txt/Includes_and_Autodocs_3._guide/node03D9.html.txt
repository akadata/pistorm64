SYNOPSIS PrintIText( RastPort , IText, LeftOffset, TopOffset ) A0 A1 D0 D1 VOID PrintIText( struct RastPort *, struct IntuiText *, WORD, WORD ); FUNCTION Prints the IntuiText into the specified RastPort . Sets up the RastPort as specified by the IntuiText values, then prints the text into the RastPort at the IntuiText x/y coordinates offset by the left/top arguments. Note, though, that the IntuiText structure itself may contain further text position coordinates: those coordinates and the Left/TopOffsets are added to obtain the true position of the text to be rendered. This routine does window layer clipping as appropriate -- if you print text outside of your window, your characters will be clipped at the window's edge, providing you pass your window's (layered) RastPort . If the NextText field of the IntuiText argument is non-NULL, the next IntuiText is rendered as well, and so on until some NextText field is NULL. IntuiText with the ITextFont field NULL are displayed in the font of the RastPort . If the RastPort font is also NULL, the system default font, as set via the Preferences tool, will be used. INPUTS RastPort = the RastPort destination of the text IText = pointer to an instance of the structure IntuiText LeftOffset = left offset of the IntuiText into the RastPort TopOffset = top offset of the IntuiText into the RastPort RESULT None BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
