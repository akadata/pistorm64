INPUTS rp -- Pointer to the RastPort to draw into; the RastPort clipping rules, font, style, text colours and drawing mode will be used. icon -- Pointer to a struct DiskObject . label -- Pointer to a NUL-terminated string, or NULL if no label text is to be printed. leftEdge, topEdge -- Coordinates at which the icon image should be drawn, including its border; please note that the icon label may extend in whole or in part beyond the leftEdge you have specified. state -- Select how and which icon image should be drawn; see intuition/imageclass.h for supported states. tags -- Additional drawing options TAGS ICONDRAWA_DrawInfo (struct DrawInfo *) -- Drawing information data associated with the RastPort to draw into. The DrawInfo contents affect the colours of the border drawn around the icon image and also carry display aspect ratio information. If this tag is NULL, the default rendering pens for the screen selected via IconControl(...,ICONA_SetGlobalScreen,...) will be used instead. This tag defaults to NULL. ICONDRAWA_Frameless (BOOL) -- Draw the icon without the surrounding border. This tag defaults to FALSE. ICONDRAWA_Borderless (BOOL) -- Draw the icon without the surrounding border and frame. This tag defaults to FALSE. ICONDRAWA_EraseBackground (BOOL) -- When drawing a frameless icon, erase the icon background before drawing the icon. This tag defaults to TRUE. EXAMPLE /* Draw the icon in its normal state, without * a label but including a frame. */ struct RastPort *rp; struct DiskObject *icon; DrawIconStateA(rp,icon,NULL,0,0,IDS_NORMAL,NULL); /* The same again, but without a frame. */ DrawIconState(rp,icon,NULL,0,0,IDS_NORMAL, ICONDRAWA_Frameless,TRUE, TAG_DONE); /* Draw the icon in selected state with a border; the * frame colours come from the given DrawInfo . */ struct DrawInfo *drawInfo; DrawIconState(rp,icon,NULL,0,0,IDS_SELECTED, ICONDRAWA_DrawInfo,drawInfo, TAG_DONE); SEE ALSO workbench/icon.h workbench/workbench.h intuition/imageclass.h intuition/screens.h intuition.library/DrawImageState icon.library/GetIconRectangleA icon.library/IconControlA [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
