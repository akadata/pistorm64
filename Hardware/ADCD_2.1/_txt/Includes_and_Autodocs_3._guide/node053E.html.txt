resource.library/--background-- ]" border=0> NAME resource.library -- resource handling for BOOPSI classes DESCRIPTION The resource.library offers an API to handle resource objects (an object file created from ReActor or similar BOOPSI creator tools). One can create BOOPSI objects and groups of BOOPSI objects and resource tracking is completly done by resource.library. A resource object ist an AmigaDOS hunk object file that contains data structures with all necessary informations for creating BOOPSI objects. Special class informations allows to handle intuition BOOPSI objects. Strings are automatically localized if needed. The resource objects contains references to labels (for the locale string IDs) and strings (for the default strings) which has to be linked with symbol definitions from the application (a new catcomp version is available to create assembler source files for those definitions). The default label for the resource object is _RCTResource (defined by ReActor). Use a statement like extern char RCTResource[]; to access the resource object. The variable RCTResource has to be used as the first argument to RL_OpenResource . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
