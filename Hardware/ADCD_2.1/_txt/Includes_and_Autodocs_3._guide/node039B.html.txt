(V36) SYNOPSIS ChangeWindowBox( Window , Left, Top, Width, Height ) A0 D0 D1 D2 D3 VOID ChangeWindowBox( struct Window *, WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD ); FUNCTION Makes simultaneous changes in window position and dimensions, in absolute (not relative) coordinates. Like MoveWindow() and SizeWindow() , the effect of this function is deferred until the next input comes along. Unlike these functions, ChangeWindowBox() specifies absolute window position and dimensions, not relative. This makes for more reliable results considering that the action is deferred, so this function is typically preferable to MoveWindow() and SizeWindow() paired. You can detect that this operation has completed by receiving the IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW IDCMP message The dimensions are limited to legal range, but you should still take care to specify sensible inputs based on the window's dimension limits and the size of its screen. This function limits the position and dimensions to legal values. INPUTS Window = the window to change position/dimension Left, Top, Width, Height = new position and dimensions RESULT Position and dimension are changed to your specification, or as close as possible. Returns nothing. BUGS SEE ALSO MoveWindow() , SizeWindow() , ZipWindow() , layers.library/MoveSizeLayer() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
