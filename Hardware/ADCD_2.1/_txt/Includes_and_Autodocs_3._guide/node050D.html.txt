printer.device/PRD_DUMPRPORTTAGS ]" border=0> NAME PRD_DUMPRPORTTAGS -- dump the specified RastPort to a printer (V44) FUNCTION Print a rendition of the supplied RastPort , using the supplied ColorMap , position and scaling information, as specified in the printer preferences. IO REQUEST io_Message mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible. io_Command PRD_DUMPRPORT . io_Flags IOB_QUICK set if quick I/O is possible. io_RastPort ptr to a RastPort . io_ColorMap ptr to a ColorMap . io_Modes the 'modes' flag from a ViewPort structure, (the upper word is reserved and should be zero). If you are running under version 36, or greater of graphics.library, it is recommended that you fill in "io_Modes" with the ULONG (32-bit) value returned from calling: ULONG ModeID = GetVPModeID(struct ViewPort *); Doing so provides for upwards compatability with the new display modes available under V36 (example: aspect ratio calculations for new display modes). io_SrcX x offset into the RastPort to start printing from. io_SrcY y offset into the RastPort to start printing from. io_SrcWidth width of the RastPort to print (from io_SrcX). io_SrcHeight height of the RastPort to print (from io_SrcY). io_DestCols width of the printout in printer pixels. io_DestRows height of the printout in printer pixels. io_Special flag bits io_TagList a list of tags to specify more parameters for the dump. TAGS DRPA_SourceHook a pointer to struct Hook which is called to read the source data. io_RastPort and io_ColorMap are ignored and should be NULL. The hook is called with object == NULL and message is a pointer to struct DRPSourceMsg . It must read an array of source data. Each pixel of the array is an ULONG of form 0x00RRGGBB. Some printer drivers have set PPCB_NOSTRIPE which means they cannot print in stripes. Using DRPA_SourceHook is the best way for printing for such printers because you can still prepare the printer source data in stripes then. The Source Hook is always called in the context of the printer driver DOS process. DRPA_AspectX the X aspect ratio. DRPA_AspectY the Y aspect ratio. This values overwrites the aspect ratio from GfxBase or io_Modes and is used for scaling. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
