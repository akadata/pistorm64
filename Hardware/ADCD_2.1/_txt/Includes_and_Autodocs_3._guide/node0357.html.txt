INPUTS name -- Name of the object the icon is to be stored for, or NULL if a default icon is to be stored. icon -- The icon to be stored. tags -- Storage options. TAGS ICONPUTA_NotifyWorkbench (BOOL) -- Set this to TRUE to notify Workbench of the fact that an icon was changed. This tag defaults to FALSE. ICONPUTA_PutDefaultType (LONG) -- Type of the default icon this icon is to replace; must be one of WBDISK, WBDRAWER, WBTOOL, WBPROJECT, WBGARBAGE, WBDEVICE or WBKICK. If this tag is used, the "name" parameter will be ignored. ICONPUTA_PutDefaultName (STRPTR) -- Name of the default object type this icon is to be stored as. If this tag is used, the "name" parameter will be ignored. ICONPUTA_DropPlanarIconImage (BOOL) -- If you decide that the palette mapped icon imagery is sufficient to represent an icon, you can tell icon.library not to store the original, planar icon image data with the icon file. To do this, set this tag to TRUE. Instead of the planar icon images, a single default image will be stored. This can result in space savings but may not look too pretty. This tag defaults to FALSE. ICONPUTA_DropChunkyIconImage (BOOL) -- This tag can be used to keep the chunky icon image data from getting written to disk. This tag defaults to FALSE. ICONPUTA_DropNewIconToolTypes (BOOL) -- This tag controls whether any NewIcon tool types will be omitted when writing the icon to disk. TRUE will omit the data. This tag defaults to FALSE. ICONPUTA_OptimizeImageSpace (BOOL) -- A palette mapped icon image might not use the entire icon palette. By default, icon.library does not bother about this, it expects the creator of the icon to choose its palette efficiently. But just in case, you can tell icon.library to attempt to identify how many colours are really in use and to optimize its image compressor for them. This may take extra time and is not recommended for daily use. This tag defaults to FALSE. ICONPUTA_OnlyUpdatePosition (BOOL) -- This tag can be used to reduce the overhead in updating icon information on disk if the only information changed is the icon position. For this case, you can set this tag to TRUE. The icon to be modified will have only its do_CurrentX/do_CurrentY member values changed, the remainer will stay unmodified. Please note that this tag only takes effect if the ICONPUTA_PutDefaultType and ICONPUTA_PutDefaultName tags are omitted. This tag defaults to FALSE. ICONPUTA_PreserveOldIconImages (BOOL) -- Before writing a palette mapped icon back to disk, icon.library will make sure that the original planar image data is stored in the file. If you don't want that to happen, set this option to FALSE. This tag will allow you to change the planar icon image data written back to disk. This tag defaults to TRUE. ICONA_ErrorCode (LONG *) -- Pointer to a LONG word variable to store error codes in. Note that this variable will be initialized regardless of whether an error occured or not. Thus, you can check for an error condition by comparing the variable contents against 0; 0 indicates success, all other values are error codes as defined by dos.library. RESULT success -- TRUE if the icon file could be stored, FALSE otherwise. You can use IoErr() to retrieve the error code or use the ICONA_ErrorCode tag instead. EXAMPLE /* Store an icon as the default "picture" icon. */ struct DiskObject *icon; LONG errorCode; BOOL success; success = PutIconTags(NULL,icon, ICONPUTA_PutDefaultName,"picture", ICONA_ErrorCode,&errorCode, TAG_DONE); if(success == FALSE) { Printf("could not store default picture icon;n"); PrintFault(errorCode,NULL); } NOTES This function is a superset of PutDefDiskObject() and PutDiskObject() . If the name of the icon file to be stored would be too long to fit (as set with IconControl(..., ICONCTRLA_SetGlobalMaxNameLength, ...)) then PutIconTagList() will silently pretend that the icon file has been written to disk. However, it will not store the icon file on the disk since there would a risk of accidentally overwriting the file the icon belongs to. If you want to know whether the icon you wrote was in fact written to disk, provide an error code pointer with the ICONA_ErrorCode tag. If the name of the file was too long, PutIconTagList() will still pretend that the icon file was written successfully, but the error code ERROR_TOO_MANY_LEVELS will be stored in the variable you passed in with the ICONA_ErrorCode tag.
