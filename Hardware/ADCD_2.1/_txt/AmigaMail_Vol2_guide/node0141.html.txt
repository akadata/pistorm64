TITLE: Level 2 Quality: The Next Standard

Level 2 Quality: The Next Standard ]" border=0> In addition to the requirements of the Level One, products need to be compelling enough to compete successfully in the marketplace. 32. All titles must have an important and distinguishing value over doing the product on magnetic media, or by book, or by cassette. Products should have greater detail, more choices, more ``sizzle'', be easier to use, or be faster to perform a function. Ports from another platform--including the Amiga--must be enhanced (music, speech, additional video, more choices, etc.). An example of an excellent port is SimCity which added digital audio and rewrote the user interface to take advantage of the numeric keypad on the IR controller. 33. Timely response is important. On a multitasking operating system, the time that elapses from when a selection is made till the activity begins should be no more than three seconds. This is part perception (i.e., start showing a graphic change while still loading), part disk organization (to speed access times), and part programming (sometimes things can be cached or optimized). (Asterix appears to have achieved this goal, so it is therefore possible.) To reiterate, first audio/visual feedback, then some type of transition interlude which lasts no longer than three seconds, then the desired result. For very long searches that cannot be done in a short period of time, inform the user of the progress of the search. Options include putting up a screen and start listing ``hits'' or showing a ``gas gauge'' depicting the progress of a search. 34. Multimedia elements should be comparable to video or cartoons viewed on TV. These elements (animations, speech, music, sounds, video) should be streamed from disk so that they can be more in-depth and longer in duration. The animations should normally be 3 dimensional and change focus (i.e., background, perspective), not limited to a static background screen. 35. Educational titles and adventure type recreational products need to have a depth of interactivity options. For instance, if a character is walking down a street, the user should be able to go down alleyways, into buildings, etc. Each screen or in each section should have more than one (and more than two!) things that can be done. These options should include non-linear choices, i.e., being able to jump around. Linear choices are really no choices at all because you must follow a prescribed path. 36. Educational titles should have some type of testing function to allow you to examine your progress in a section. The Bookmark feature should be used if appropriate (e.g., game scores, place in a book, tests, etc.). 37. Reference titles should allow numbers and spaces to be input for searches. All reference titles should support searches on keywords in body or title, and not be just an alphabetized index of options (similar to the index of a book). They should also have the Bookmark feature using Non-Volatile RAM (NVR) to save search criteria and possibly the resultant elements. 38. Recreational titles should use continuous streamed animations and CD audio for background. They should be able to save game states and high scores using NVR. 39. Possible suggestions: Online help Templates to fit on top of the IR controller to simplify the buttons for complex products (i.e., flight simulator). Optionally viewable demo commercials of other products. Hardware add-ons (a la Nintendo). Supply a formatted disk (or at least a disk label) if the product can use a floppy.
