TITLE: Using Multiple RastPorts

Using Multiple RastPorts ]" border=0> A RastPort specifies attributes needed to perform many rendering operations. These include the RastPort's foreground, background, and drawing mode. The Graphics library functions SetAPen(), SetBPen(), and SetDrMd() set each of these attributes, respectively. Although these functions appear to have fairly simple purposes in life, the SetAPen(), SetBPen(), and SetDrMd() are quite CPU intensive routines. These functions require recalculating values that the OS caches in private parts of the RastPort. If an application only requires a few different combinations of foreground/background/draw mode, it can improve its performance by using a different RastPort structure for each combination. An application sets the attributes of several RastPorts only once which is generally more efficient that setting the attributes of one RastPort every time the rendering attributes change. Assume an application has a window in which it renders all of its data in pen 1, and clears any part of its display using color 0. Such an application can improve its rendering performance by doing the following: struct RastPort dataRP; struct RastPort clrRP; dataRP = *window->RPort; SetAPen(&dataRP,1); SetBPen(&dataRP,0); clrRP = *window->RPort; SetAPen(&clrRP,0); /* renders to the window's RastPort in color 1 */ Text(&dataRP,"hello",5); /* clears a section of the window's RastPort in color 0 */ RectFill(&clrRPort,0,0,10,10); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
