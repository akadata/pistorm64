TITLE: DeleteCxObjAll()

DeleteCxObjAll() ]" border=0> Cleaning up after a commodity requires deleting its CxObjects. If a commodity has a lot of CxObjects, deleting each individually can be a bit tedious. DeleteCxObjAll() will delete a CxObject and any other CxObjects that are attached to it. void DeleteCxObjAll( CxObj *delete_co ); HotKey uses this function to delete all its CxObjects. A commodity that uses DeleteCxObjAll() to delete all its CxObjects should make sure that they are all connected to the main one. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
