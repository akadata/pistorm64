Credits ]" border=0> I thank greatly the input and bug reports I got from Bill Hawes during the development of the 2.0 DOS and it's shell interface. It's still extremely ungainly, but it is now usable. I also thank Michael B. Smith and Jesper Steen Moller for taking the initial confusing Usenet article I posted and making working shells from that information, and John Orr for making me write this article and producing the example (which helped make me clean up confusing points in it).
