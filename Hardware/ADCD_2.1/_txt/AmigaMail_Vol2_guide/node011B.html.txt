Opening a SANA-II Device ]" border=0> As when opening any other Exec device, on the call to OpenDevice() a SANA-II device receives an IORequest structure which the device initializes for the opener's use. The opener must copy this structure if it desires to use multiple asynchronous requests. The SANA-II IORequest is defined as follows: struct IOSana2Req { struct IORequest ios2_Req; ULONG ios2_WireError; ULONG ios2_PacketType; UBYTE ios2_SrcAddr[SANA2_MAX_ADDR_BYTES]; UBYTE ios2_DstAddr[SANA2_MAX_ADDR_BYTES]; ULONG ios2_DataLength; APTR *ios2_Data; APTR *ios2_StatData; APTR *ios2_BufferManagement; }; ios2_Req - A standard Exec device IORequest. ios2_WireError - A more specific device code which may be set when there is an io_Error. See devices/sana2.h > for the defined WireErrors. ios2_PacketType - The type of packet requested. See the section on " Packet Type ". ios2_SrcAddr - The device fills in this field with the interface (network hardware) address of the source of the packet that satisfied a read command. The bytes used to hold the address will be left justified but the bit layout is dependent on the particular type of network. ios2_DstAddr - Before the device user sends a packet, it fills this with the interface destination address of the packet. On receives, the device fills this with the interface destination address. Other commands may use this field differently (see the SANA-II Network Device Driver Autodocs ). The bytes used to hold the address will be left justified but the bit layout is dependent on the particular type of network. ios2_DataLength - The device user initializes this field with the amount of data available in the Data buffer before passing the IOSana2Req to the device. The device fills in this field with the size of the packet data as it was sent on the wire. This does not include the header and trailer information. Depending on the network type and protocol type, the driver may have to calculate this value. This is generally used only for reads and writes (including broadcast and multicast). ios2_Data - A pointer to some abstract data structure containing packet data. Drivers may not directly manipulate or examine anything pointed to by Data! This is generally used only for reads and writes (including broadcast and multicast). ios2_StatData - Pointer to a structure in which to place a snapshot of device statistics. The data area must be long word aligned. This is only used on calls to the statistics commands. ios2_BufferManagement - The opener places a pointer to a tag list in this field before calling OpenDevice(). Functions pointed to in the tag list are called by the device when processing IORequests from the opener. When returned from OpenDevice(), this field contains a pointer to driver-private information used to access these functions. See " Buffer Management " below for more details. The flags used with the device on OpenDevice() are (SANA2OPB_xxx): SANA2OPB_MINE - Exclusive access to the unit requested. SANA2OPB_PROM - Promiscuous mode requested. Hardware which supports promiscuous mode allows all packets sent over the wire to be captured whether or not they are addressed to this node. The flags used during I/O requests are (SANA2IOB_xxx): SANA2IOB_RAW - Raw packet read/write requested. Raw packets should include the entire data-link layer packet. Devices with the same hardware device number should have the same raw packet format. SANA2IOB_BCAST - Broadcast packet (received). SANA2IOB_MCAST - Multicast packet (received). SANA2IOB_QUICK - Quick IO requested. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
