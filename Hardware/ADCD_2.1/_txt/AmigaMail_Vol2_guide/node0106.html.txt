Kinds of Servers ]" border=0> There are two kinds of servers. Those which process one request at a time are called "iterative servers". Those which simultaneously service multiple requests (often by spawning a process to handle each request) are called "concurrent servers". Iterative servers are generally easier to write, but are only suitable for services which can be handled quickly and/or will not be accessed by multiple clients. Applications which use connectionless protocols (UDP) frequently have iterative servers, while applications with connection-oriented protocols (TCP) usually have concurrent servers.
