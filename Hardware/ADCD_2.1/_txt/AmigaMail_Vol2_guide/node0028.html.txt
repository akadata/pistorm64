Other Hardware Issues ]" border=0> * Battery-backed clock is different on A3000. Use battclock.resource to access the real-time clock if battclock.resource can be opened. * A 68030 hardware characteristic causes longword-aligned longword writes to allocate a valid entry in the data cache, even if the hardware area shouldn't be cached. This can cause problems for IO registers and shared memory devices. To solve this: 1) Don't do that 2) Flush the cache or 3) Use Enforcer Quiet. See the Motorola 68030 manual under the description of the Write Allocate bit (which must be set for the Amiga to run with the Data Cache). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
