sysiclass ]" border=0> Class: sysiclass Superclass: imageclass Description: Class for system and standard application images. Include File: New Methods: ------------ None. Changed Methods: ---------------- OM_NEW - Executes a drawing commands list to create a fast-rendering image object. The glyph of the object is defined by the attribute SYSIA_Which. The SYSIA_DrawInfo parameter is required at initialization, as is IA_Height. Image size defaults are established by SYSIA_Size, but some images (title bar gadget images) require IA_Height. Images are scaled to their dimensions. Attributes: ----------- SYSIA_DrawInfo (IS) This attribute must be passed to OM_NEW and OM_SET to allow the image to be generated into a bitmap cache. SYSIA_Which (I) Identifies which of the system image glyphs the caller wants. It can be one of the following: DEPTHIMAGE Window depth arrangement image. ZOOMIMAGE Window Zoom image. SIZEIMAGE Window Sizing image. CLOSEIMAGE Window close image. SDEPTHIMAGE Screen depth arrangement image. LEFTIMAGE Left arrow image. UPIMAGE Up arrow image. RIGHTIMAGE Right arrow image. DOWNIMAGE Down arrow image. CHECKIMAGE Checkmark image. MXIMAGE Radio button image. SYSIA_Size (I) Identifies which default dimensions to use for the object. This generalizes Intuition's older concept of two different system image dimensions. The system currently uses SYSISIZE_MEDRES as the default, SYSISIZE_HIRES for screens with title bars greater than 22 pixels, and SYSISIZE_LORES for screens with fat pixels.
