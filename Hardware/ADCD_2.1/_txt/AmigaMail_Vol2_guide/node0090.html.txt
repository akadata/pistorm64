TITLE: Opening Screens and Windows

Opening Screens and Windows ]" border=0> Intuition V36 supplies two new functions to open screens and windows: OpenScreenTagList() and OpenWindowTagList(). They provide added functionality over the older OpenScreen() and OpenWindow() functions. Instead of the NewScreen and NewWindow structures, an array of parameters called tags is passed to the function in the form of a TagItem structure pointer. This array is known as a tag list. For a description of using tags in Intuition, see the Amiga Mail article ``TagItems and Tag Lists''. The following is a simple example of the usage of OpenScreenTagList() and OpenWindowTagList(), using only a tag list as a parameter to each function. struct TagItem tagitem[3]; struct Screen *screen; struct Window *window; tagitem[0].ti_Tag = SA_DisplayID; tagitem[0].ti_Data = HIRES_KEY; /* Use HIRES displaymode for default monitor */ tagitem[1].ti_Tag = SA_Title; tagitem[1].ti_Data = "AmigaMail Test Screen"; tagitem[2].ti_Tag = TAG_DONE; /* Marks the end of the tag array. */ /* All others options will be set to default. Note this screen will not open with the 'New Look', due to the absence of the SA_Pens tag and data. Further examples will have this tag */ if (screen = OpenScreenTagList(NULL, tagitem)) { tagitem[0].ti_Tag = WA_CustomScreen; tagitem[0].ti_Data = screen; /* Open on my own screen */ tagitem[1].ti_Tag = WA_Title; tagitem[1].ti_Data = "AmigaMail Test Window"; tagitem[2].ti_Tag = TAG_DONE; /* Marks the end of the tag array. */ /* Use defaults for everything else. Will open as big as the screen. */ if (window = OpenWindowTagList(NULL, tagitem)) { /* rest of code */ CloseWindow(window); } CloseScreen(screen) } See the intuition/intuition.h and intuition/screens.h include files for a complete list of currently supported tags. Intuition.library provides a function to get information about screens and display modes called GetScreenDrawInfo(). This function returns a subset of the data supplied by the graphics.library's GetDisplayInfoData() function. Given a pointer to a screen, GetScreenDrawInfo() returns a pointer to a DrawInfo structure describing that screen. Note that this structure is read-only. The DrawInfo structure contains information about the resolution, default font and pen colors of the screen. Since the system allocates the DrawInfo structure when GetScreenDrawInfo() is called, a program must tell the system to free it by calling FreeScreenDrawInfo(). Of course, a program should only release the DrawInfo structure after it is no longer needed. When using GetScreenDrawInfo() on a public screen, the screen should first be locked using Intuition's LockPubScreen() function. This will prevent a public screen from closing while your program is looking at the screen's DrawInfo structure. UnlockPubScreen() will unlock the screen. Public screens are discussed in more detail later in this article. The graphics.library function GetVPModeID() provides a way of determining the display mode ID associated with a ViewPort. Passed the ViewPort attached to a screen, the function will return the display mode ID for that ViewPort, or INVALID_ID if no display mode ID is associated with the ViewPort. An example of the usage of GetVPModeID() and the other functions discussed so far in this article are provided in at the end of thisarticle in example 1, CloneWB.c . This example also uses the stack-based amiga.lib support library functions OpenScreenTags() and OpenWindowTags(), both of which are documented in the release 2.0 Autodocs.
