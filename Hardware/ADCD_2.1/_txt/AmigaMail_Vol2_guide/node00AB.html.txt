TITLE: IM_DRAWFRAME

IM_DRAWFRAME ]" border=0> The IM_DRAWFRAME method instructs the image to render itself within the confines of the given rectangle. It receives the following parameters: struct impDraw { ULONG MethodID; struct RastPort *imp_RPort; struct { WORD X; WORD Y; } imp_Offset; ULONG imp_State; struct DrawInfo *imp_DrInfo; struct { WORD Width; WORD Height; } imp_Dimensions; }; The Width and Height fields provide the object's rectangular bounds. How the image object deals with the frame is implementation specific. Typically, a scaleable image will scale itself as best it can to fit into the rectangle. The mytextlabelclass.c example does not actually implement this method, instead mytextlabelclass treats IM_DRAWFRAME like the IM_DRAW method. In general, applications that use this method to draw an object should use the IM_ERASEFRAME method (see below) to erase it. This will ensure that the image was erased at the proper scale.
