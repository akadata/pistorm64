TITLE: Help Key

Help Key ]" border=0> The A500 keyboard has a Help key, rawkey code 5F. To run effectively on both the CDTV and A500 with an A570, applications should support both the Escape key and the Help key to obtain Help functions. If an application detects that the user has pressed either the Help key or the Escape key on the Amiga keyboard, the application should provide a help function to the user.
