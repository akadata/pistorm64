XTRN (0x5854524E) / Externally controlled object / ]" border=0> The XTRN chunk was created primarily to allow ProVector to link DR2D objects to ARexx functions. struct XTRNstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; short ApplCallBacks; /* From #defines, below */ short ApplNameLength; char ApplName[ApplNameLength]; /* Name of ARexx func to call */ }; ApplName[] contains the name of the ARexx script ProVector calls when the user manipulates the object in some way. The ApplCallBacks field specifies the particular action that triggers calling the ARexx script according to the #defines listed below. /* Flags for ARexx script callbacks */ #define X_CLONE 0x0001 /* The object has been cloned */ #define X_MOVE 0x0002 /* The object has been moved */ #define X_ROTATE 0x0004 /* The object has been rotated */ #define X_RESIZE 0x0008 /* The object has been resized */ #define X_CHANGE 0x0010 /* An attribute (see ATTR) of the object has changed */ #define X_DELETE 0x0020 /* The object has been deleted */ #define X_CUT 0x0040 /* The object has been deleted, but stored in the clipboard */ #define X_COPY 0x0080 /* The object has been copied to the clipboard */ #define X_UNGROUP 0x0100 /* The object has been ungrouped */ For example, given the XTRN object: FORM xxxx DR2D { XTRN xxxx { X_RESIZE | X_MOVE, 10, "Dimension" } ATTR xxxx { 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.0 } FORM xxxx DR2D { GRUP xxxx { 2 } STXT xxxx { 0, 0.5, 1.0, 6.0, 5.0, 0.0, 4, "3.0" } OPLY xxxx { 2, { 5.5, 5.5, 8.5, 5.5 } } } } ProVector would call the ARexx script named Dimension if the user resized or moved this object. What exactly ProVector sends depends upon what the user does to the object. The following list shows what string(s) ProVector sends according to which flag(s) are set. The parameters are described below. X_CLONE "appl CLONE objID dx dy" X_MOVE "appl MOVE objID dx dy" X_ROTATE "appl ROTATE objID cx cy angle" X_RESIZE "appl RESIZE objID cx cy sx sy" X_CHANGE "appl CHANGE objID et ev ft fv ew jt fn" X_DELETE "appl DELETE objID" X_CUT "appl CUT objID" X_COPY "appl COPY objID" X_UNGROUP "appl UNGROUP objID" where: appl is the name of the ARexx script CLONE, MOVE, ROTATE, RESIZE, etc. are literal strings objID is the object ID that ProVector assigns to this object (dx, dy) is the position offset of the CLONE or MOVE (cx, cy) is the point around which the object is rotated or resized angle is the angle (in degrees) the object is rotated sx and sy are the scaling factors in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. et is the edge type (the dash pattern index) ev is the edge value (the edge color index) ft is the fill type fv is the fill index ew is the edge weight jt is the join type fn is the font name The X_CHANGE message reflects changes to the attributes found in the ATTR chunk. If the user resized the XTRN object shown above by factor of 2, ProVector would call the ARexx script Dimension like this: Dimension RESIZE 1985427 7.0 4.75 2.0 2.0 [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
