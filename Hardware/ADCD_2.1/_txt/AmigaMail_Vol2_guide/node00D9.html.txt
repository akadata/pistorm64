TITLE: Rotating

Rotating ]" border=0> Taking advantage of other features of the Bullet library is a matter of setting other engine parameters using one of the SetInfo() functions with some other level 0 tags. One interesting feature of the IntelliFont engine is its ability to rotate glyphs. By setting the OT_RotateSin and OT_RotateCos values, the IntelliFont engine can rotate a glyph's baseline from the glyph origin (the glm_XOrigin and glm_YOrigin from the GlyphMap structure). The OT_RotateSin and OT_RotateCos are, respectively, the sine and cosine of the baseline rotation angle. The engine can rotate to any angle. The sine and cosine must correspond to the same angle and must be in the sine and cosine value range (0 through 1 inclusive). The engine does not do any error checking on the sine and cosine values. As a result, the engine will yield strange results if the sine and cosine are from very different angles or if these values are out of range for sines and cosines (greater than 1). By default, the engine sets these values to 0.0 and 1.0, the sine and cosine of 0 degrees. These values are encoded as fixed point binary fractions (the negative values are two's complement). When setting the baseline rotation, an application must set both the sine and cosine. It must set OT_RotateSin first, then OT_RotateCos. An application can set both values in the same SetInfo() function, but the sine must come first. For example, to set the rotation angle to 150 degrees: The sine of 150 degrees is 0.5 which is 0x00008000 in hex. The cosine of 150 degrees is approximately -0.866 which is approximately 0xffff224c in hex (two's complement), so: . . . if (SetInfo(ge, OT_RotateSin, 0x8000, OT_RotateCos, 0xFFFF224C, TAG_END) == OTERR_Success) /* If SetInfo() returns OTERR_Success, */ /* it worked OK. */ { /* The baseline rotation has been set, now the application can */ /* render it. */ . . .
