TITLE: Image Class Example

Image Class Example ]" border=0> The image class example code, mytextlabelclass.c , illustrates a complete custom image class. This image class provides an application with textual labels that have a particular character underlined. This is useful for indicating which key controls a gadget (although the example provided only utilizes imageclass objects; there are no gadgets involved). A custom image can be used in the place of any standard Intuition Image structure. For example, an application can attach an imageclass object to: the GadgetRender and SelectRender fields of a Gadget structure (defined in ), the ReqImage field of a Requester structure, or even the ItemFill field of the MenuItem structure. Under Intuition V36, the DrawImage() function passed an invalid DrawInfo structure, therefore it wasn't possible to use a custom imageclass object and the DrawImage() together. With V37, a NULL DrawInfo is passed when no valid DrawInfo is available. The example code ( usemyIC.c ) initializes and uses a custom imageclass object. Notice that usemyIC.c directly manipulates fields within the Image structure embedded within the boopsi imageclass object. This is legal for image classes whose immediate superclass is imageclass (for the LeftEdge, TopEdge, Width, Height, ImageData, PlanePick, and PlaneOnOff Image structure fields only; the other Image structure fields are off limits). Indirect subclasses of imageclass may not alter the values in the embedded Image structure as future direct subclasses of imageclass may need to know about changes to values in the Image structure.
