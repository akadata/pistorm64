TITLE: XII-1: CDTV Application Guidelines

XII-1: CDTV Application Guidelines ]" border=0> Staff A CDTV application is not simply an Amiga application running in a different box. The CDTV player imposes certain restrictions on an application--no menus and large icons, for example, and provides certain benefits--large storage capacity and digital audio. The wise CDTV developer respects the former and takes advantage of the latter. The list below gives you, the developer, a quick reference to the do's and don'ts of CDTV applications. It contains rules and common sense advice. They are broken into two groups, minimum requirements and quality standards. Minimum Requirements - The minimum necessary to be an acceptable CDTV application. Quality Standards - To get into people's homes, you need to do more than the minimum. These will help you make the trip. Level 1 Minimum Requirements Reference Titles Recreation Titles Level 2 Quality: The Next Standard [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
