TITLE: Installing a Broker

Installing a Broker ]" border=0> The Commodities Exchange input handler maintains a master list of CxObjects to which it diverts input events using CxMessages. The CxObjects in this master list are a special type of CxObject called a broker. The only thing a broker CxObject does is div ert CxMessages to its own personal list of CxObjects. A commodity creates a broker and attaches other CxObjects to it. These attached objects take care of the actual input handler related work of the commodity and make up the broker's personal list. Program listing 1, Broker.c , (located at the end of this article) is a very simple example of a working commodity. It serves only to illustrate the basics of a commodity, not to actually perform any useful function. It shows how to set up a broker and p rocess commands from the controller program. Besides opening commodities.library and creating an Exec message port, setting up a commodity requires creating a broker. The function CxBroker() creates a broker and adds it to the master list. CxObj *CxBroker(struct NewBroker *nb, long *error); CxBroker()'s first argument is a pointer to a NewBroker structure: struct NewBroker { BYTE nb_Version; /* There's an implicit pad byte after */ BYTE *nb_Name; /* this BYTE */ BYTE *nb_Title; BYTE *nb_Descr; SHORT nb_Unique; SHORT nb_Flags; BYTE nb_Pri; /* There's an implicit pad byte after this BYTE */ struct MsgPort *nb_Port; WORD nb_ReservedChannel; }; Commodities Exchange gets all the information it needs about the broker from this structure. NewBroker's nb_Version field contains the version number of the NewBroker structure. This should be set to NB_VERSION which is defined in . The nb_Name, nb_Title, and nb_Descr point to strings which hold the name, title, and description of the broker. The two bit fields, nb_Unique and nb_Flags, toggle certain features of Commodities Exchange based on their values. They are discussed in detail later in this article. The nb_Pri field contains the broker's priority. Commodities Exchange inserts the broker into the master list based on this number. Higher priority brokers get CxMessages before lower priority brokers. CxBroker()'s second argument is a pointer to a LONG. If this pointer is not NULL, CxBroker() fills in this field with one of the following codes from : CBERR_OK 0 /* No error */ CBERR_SYSERR 1 /* System error , no memory, etc */ CBERR_DUP 2 /* uniqueness violation */ CBERR_VERSION 3 /* didn't understand nb_VERSION */ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
