TITLE: Matching

Matching ]" border=0> Once a pattern is parsed, it can be compared to a string using either the case sensitive MatchPattern() or the case insensitive MatchPatternNoCase() functions. These functions have the following synopsis: BOOL MatchPattern(UBYTE *mytokenpattern, UBYTE *mystring); BOOL MatchPatternNoCase (UBYTE *mytokenpattern, UBYTE *mystring); These functions will compare the wildcard pattern string, mytokenpattern (created by ParsePattern/NoCase()), to mystring. If mystring matches the pattern in mytokenpattern, these routines return TRUE, otherwise they return FALSE. Because these routines are recursive, they can use a lot of stack space, although they will not use more than 1500 bytes of stack space. Make sure the stack space is at least 1500 bytes before calling these routines. In V36, these routines did not perform any stack checking. This was added in V37. If either of these functions detect a stack overflow, they will return 0 and IoErr() will return ERROR_TOO_MANY_LEVELS. If IoErr() returns 0, there was simply no match. The Pattern.c example at the end of this article shows how to use the parse and match functions and allows you to test and experiment with patterns. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
