Genlock ]" border=0> The Genlock button on the CDTV remote is for mode selection of an optional video genlock device that can be installed in the CDTV. This button has no equivalent on the A570. If you want to support this feature in an application running on an A570, you cannot be sure that the genlock used with the Amiga supports software control of mode switching. Again, mention this fact in the user manual. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
