TITLE: Escape Key

Escape Key ]" border=0> The ESCAPE key requires special attention with a keyboard. On the CDTV remote control, the ESCAPE key generates the ESCAPE rawkey code of 45 hex, the same code as on the A500's keyboard. The CDTV User Interface Guidelines recommend that titles use the ESCAPE button as a HELP key. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
