TITLE: Acknowledgments

Acknowledgments ]" border=0> Many people and companies have contributed to the SANA-II Network Device Driver Specification. The original SANA-II Autodocs and includes were put together by Ray Brand, Perry Kivolowitz (ASDG) and Martin Hunt. Those original documents evolved to their current state and grew to include this document at the hands of Dale Larson and Greg Miller. Brian Jackson and John Orr provided valuable editing. Randell Jesup has provided sage advice on several occasions. The buffer management callback mechanism was his idea. Dale Luck (GfxBase) and Rick Spanbauer (Ameristar Technologies) have provided valuable comments throughout the process. Nicolas Benezan (ADONIS) provided many detailed and useful comments on weaknesses in late drafts of the specification. Thanks to all the above and the numerous others who have contributed with their comments, questions and discussions. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
