XIII-1: Video Adapter Diagrams ]" border=0> by Adam Levin-Delson All Amigas have a video connector which supplies RGB output in both analog and digital formats. This allows the Amiga to use many different types of monitors. Besides this standard Amiga video connector, the A3000 (and A3000T) have a ``Video Display Enhancer'' (VDE) connector which supplies an analog RGB signal at up to twice the bandwidth of the standard Amiga port. Commodore sells a number of monitors which have cables that allow you to connect them to the Amiga. Other manufacturers sell monitors that will work with an Amiga, but many of these monitors are not pin-compatible with the Amiga. This can be remedied by buying or building an adapter which either reconfigures the wiring or adds the necessary circuitry between the computer and monitor. This article contains the wiring diagrams for those adapters.
