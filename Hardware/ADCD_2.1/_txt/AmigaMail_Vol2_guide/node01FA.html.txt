sana2.device/S2_READORPHAN ]" border=0> NAME ReadOrphan -- Get a packet for which there is no reader. FUNCTION Get the next packet available that does not satisfy any then-pending CMD_READ requests. The data returned in the ios2_Data structure is normally the Data Link Layer packet type field and the packet data. If bit SANA2IOB_RAW is set in ios2_Flags, then the entire Data Link Layer packet, including both header and trailer information, will be returned. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - CMD_READORPHAN. ios2_Flags - Supported flags are: SANA2IOB_RAW SANA2IOB_QUICK ios2_DataLength - Length of the Data to be sent. ios2_Data - Abstract data structure which packet data is contained in. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. ios2_Flags - The following flags may be returned: SANA2IOB_RAW SANA2IOB_BCAST SANA2IOB_MCAST ios2_SrcAddr - Source interface address of packet. ios2_DstAddr - Destination interface address of packet. ios2_DataLength - Length of the Data to be sent. ios2_Data - Abstract data structure which packet data is contained in. NOTES This is intended for debugging and management tools. Protocols should not use this. As with 802.3 packets on an ethernet, to determine which protocol family the returned packet belongs to you may have to specify SANA2IOB_RAW to get the entire data link layer wrapper (which is where the protocol type may be kept). Notice this necessarily means that this cannot be done in a network interface independent fashion. The driver will, however, fill in the PacketType field to the best of its ability.
