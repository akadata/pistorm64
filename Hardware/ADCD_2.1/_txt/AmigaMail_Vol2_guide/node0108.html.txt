Finding Servers ]" border=0> A client "finds" its server by the server's transport address. As was mentioned eariler, the transport address consists of a protocol, a host address, and a port number. For the TCP/IP protocol stack, the protocol is either TCP or UDP. The next thing the client needs to build after the transport address is an internet address for the server's machine. Normally the client obtains that address from the user. The address can be in one of two forms, an internet address (in dotted decimal notation), or a host name which is an ASCII string that corresponds to the host's internet address. If the client gets a host name, it asks the socket.library what internet address corresponds to the host name. When a server starts, it opens a socket and bind()s that socket using the server's well-known port number. There are two ways for the server's well-known port to become well-known: 1) A server's well-known port number can be hard-coded into both the client and server. This is recommended for prototyping new programs, but is a Very Bad Thing for programs which will be distributed. The port number is arbitrary, but must not be one of the reserved ports (see the next section) and must not conflict with a port number already in use. 2) Port numbers can be configurable. All distributed network applications should use configurable port numbers. In programs written for AS225, you should use the inet:db/services file to configure a port number. The function getservbyname() accepts a protocol (UDP or TCP) and the name of a well-known server and returns the port number of that service. This requires you to configure your application by adding an entry to the inet:db/services file on every machine which will use the application. Many standard Internet applications and Unix remote services are already in the inet:db/services file that comes with AS225. If your application isn't already included, your installation scripts should add the entry for your application to inet:db/services. Offer a default value, but let your user actually pick the number since your port number must not conflict with another (pre-existing) port number. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
