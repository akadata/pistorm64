TITLE: Sample Enforcer Output

Sample Enforcer Output ]" border=0> Here is a sample Enforcer hit which was caused by a program called Lawbreaker which tried to read from location $14. Program Counter (approximate)= 343F4A Fault address = 14 User stack pointer = 348734 DOS process address = 339590 Data: DDDD0000 DDDD1100 DDDD2200 DDDD3300 DDDD4400 DDDD5500 DDDD6600 DDDD7700 Addr: AAAA0000 AAAA1100 AAAA2200 AAAA3300 AAAA4400 AAAA5500 AAAA6600 00002E28 Stck: 00210D70 00000FA0 00339F84 BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB READ-WORD (---)(-)(-) SR=0008 SSW=0161 Background CLI, "lawbreaker", Hunk #0, Offset $5A Program Counter - Normally, this is the address of the instruction that was executing when the Enforcer hit occurred. For some types of Enforcer hits, this is the address of the instruction that executed after the hit. Note that if a program passes a bad pointer or an improperly initialized structure to a system ROM routine, it can cause the ROM code to read or write to an illegal address. Fault Address - This is the address where the illegal access occurred. In this example, the illegal access occurred at address $14, and as specified later in the debugging output, this access was a READ-WORD access. So the illegal memory access was an attempt to read a word (2 bytes) at address $14. Low memory accesses are often caused by NULL pointers to structures. If, for example, a ROM routine references a WORD-sized structure member at offset $20, and an application passes the ROM routine a NULL pointer as a pointer to that structure, Enforcer will report that the ROM routine tried to read a word at address $20. User Stack Pointer - This is the value that was in register A7 when the Enforcer hit occurred. It points to the top of the stack for the task that was running when the Enforcer hit occurred. DOS Process Address - This points to the Task structure of the task that was running when the Enforcer hit occurred. Data/Addr (Register Dump) - This is the contents of registers D0-D7 and A0-A7. This information can help assembly programmers and programmers who like to debug at a low level. Notice that register A7, the stack pointer, no longer contains the stack pointer for the task that caused the Enforcer hit (A7 does not match the user stack pointer above). Ignore the value in A7. Stck (Stack Dump) - This is the eight long words at the top of the offending program's stack. For those who need to see more of the stack, there is a special version of Enforcer called Enforcer.megastack. that shows the last 32 long words on the stack. Access Type - This tells what kind of memory access the Enforcer hit is. In this example the access is a READ-WORD, which most likely is a result of Lawbreaker accessing a word-sized structure member. There are two other read access types: READ-BYTE, which is generally a result of a bad string pointer, and READ-LONG, which is normally a result of a bad pointer or a bad pointer within a structure. When an errant program directly or indirectly writes over Enforcer-protected memory, Enforcer reports a WRITE-BYTE, WRITE-WORD, or WRITE-LONG type access. When Enforcer issues an INSTRUCTION type memory access, the CPU tried to load an instruction from an invalid address. Some common causes for this type of Enforcer hit are: An errant program has overwritten a program's instructions, An errant program has overwritten a subroutine return address that was on the stack, The CPU tried to execute a library function using an invalid library base. Notice that the errant program is not necessarily the program that caused the Enforcer hit. Interrupt/Forbid/Disable - The series of parentheses after the access type indicate if the Enforcer hit occurred in an interrupt (and if so, the interrupt level), Forbid, or Disable state: (I-n)(-)(-) The hit occurred in an n level interrupt. (---)(F)(-) The hit occurred while the Amiga was in a Forbid state. (---)(-)(D) The hit occurred while the Amiga was in a Disable state. SR (Status Register) - The CPU's status register (see 680x0 manual for more information). SSW (Special Status Word) - The special status word for 68010 though 68040 CPUs (see 680x0 manual for more information). Program Name - The program name is the name of the task or command that was executing when the Enforcer hit occurred. Hunk Number and Offset - If possible, Enforcer also provides a hunk offset to where the program counter was if the hit occurred within the program's own code instructions. This will only work if the errant program was started from a shell. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
