TITLE: XII-17: Memory Limits for Various CDTV Configurations

XII-17: Memory Limits for Various CDTV Configurations ]" border=0> by Adam Levin-Delson RAM space is at a premium in the CDTV, so for the developer who is creating CDTV titles, it is important to know what the limits of system memory are. This is especially true for developers who want their titles to work on a variety of CDTV/A500 configurations. To help assist developers in making titles work on the maximum number of configurations, the following chart shows a variety of hardware configurations capable of playing CDTV discs. For comparison purposes, all machines were allowed to boot far enough to open the Workbench screen (in the default size) and a CLI/Shell window. This represents a reasonable starting point for developers to estimate if their application will fit into a CDTV's memory (To properly ascertain the amount of free memory in a particular CDTV/A500(+) at run time, use the Exec library's AvailMem() function). These results are not guaranteed for any particular configuration, they can and will change depending upon many variables, including additional hardware, overscan or interlaced screens, etc. Use this information only as a guideline. Do not assume that these result will remain constant in future releases of the OS. WARNING: -------- A title that consumes too much memory on a current configuration may not work in the future if a new release of the OS consumes even a little more memory. Important note about Workbench V1.3 and V 2.0. Under 1.3, the Workbench screen and initial CLI always open upon booting with an AmigaDOS disc. Under 2.0, the system only opens the Workbench screen when necessary, and only opens an initial CLI if the Startup-sequence attempts to output text. The C:Avail program first calculates the amount of free RAM and then prints out the results. Under 2.0, this means the amount of memory printed by Avail would differ from the amount of memory actually free by the amount needed to create the Workbench screen and initial CLI.
