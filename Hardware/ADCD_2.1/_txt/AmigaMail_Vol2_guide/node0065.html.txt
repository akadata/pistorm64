TITLE: Console Only Packets

Console Only Packets ]" border=0> The remaining packets are only used for console handlers and do not need to be implemented by a file system. ACTION_SCREEN_MODE 994 SetMode() in 2.0 ARG1: LONG Mode (zero or one) RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE Switch the console to and from RAW mode. An ARG1 of one indicates the unprocessed, raw mode while an ARG1 of zero indicates the processed, ``cooked'' mode. ACTION_CHANGE_SIGNAL 995 ARG1: LONG The fh_Arg1 of the console file handle ARG2: APTR MsgPort of the process to signal ARG3: LONG Reserved, currently this must be zero RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE This packet redirects what process the console handler signals when the user hits Control-C, Control-D, Control-E, or Control-F. Normally the process that opened the file handle receives the break signal. ACTION_WAIT_CHAR 20 WaitForChar() ARG1: ULONG Timeout in microseconds RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE Performs a timed read of a character. The WaitForChar() function uses this packet. ACTION_DISK_INFO 25 ARG1: BPTR Pointer to an InfoData structure to fill in RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) The ACTION_DISK_INFO packet has a special meaning for console style handlers. When presented with this packet, a console style handler should return a pointer to the window associated with the open handle in the InfoData structure's id_VolumeNode field (the InfoData structure is defined in ). Note that some consoles can return a NULL Window pointer (for example, an AUTO CON: or a AUX: console). The Amiga's standard console handler, CON:, also returns a pointer to the console handler's IO request in the id_InUse field. In some cases, the IO request's io_Unit field (which normally point to a ConUnit structure) will be NULL. See also the ACTION_DISK_INFO packet in the ``Volume Manipulation/Information'' section.
