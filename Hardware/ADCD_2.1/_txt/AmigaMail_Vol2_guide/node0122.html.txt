TITLE: Errors

Errors ]" border=0> The SANA-II extended IORequest structure (struct IOSana2Req) includes both the ios2_Error and ios2_WireError fields. Driver users must always check IOSana2Reqs on return for an error in ios2_Error. ios2_Error will be zero if no error occurred, otherwise it will contain a value from or . If there was an error, there may be more specific information in ios2_WireError. Drivers are required to fill in the WireError if there is an applicable error code. Error codes are #defined in the "defined errors" sections of the file : IOSana2Req S2io_Error field (S2ERR_xxx): S2ERR_NO_RESOURCES - Insufficient resources available. S2ERR_BAD_ARGUMENT - Noticeably bad argument. S2ERR_BAD_STATE - Command inappropriate for current state. S2ERR_BAD_ADDRESS - Noticeably bad address. S2ERR_MTU_EXCEEDED - Write data too large. S2ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED - Command is not supported by this driver. This is similar to IOERR_NOCMD as defined in but S2ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED indicates that the requested command is a valid SANA-II command and that the driver does not support it because the hardware is incapable of supporting it (e.g., S2_MULTICAST). Note that IOERR_NOCMD is still valid for reasons other than a lack of hardware support (i.e., commands which are no-ops in a SANA-II driver). S2ERR_SOFTWARE - Software error of some kind. S2ERR_OUTOFSERVICE - When a hardware device is taken off-line, any pending requests are returned with this error. See also the standard errors in . IOSana2Req S2io_WireError field (S2WERR_xxx): S2WERR_NOT_CONFIGURED - Command requires unit to be configured. S2WERR_UNIT_ONLINE - Command requires that the unit be off-line. S2WERR_UNIT_OFFLINE - Command requires that the unit be on-line. S2WERR_ALREADY_TRACKED - Protocol is already being tracked. S2WERR_NOT_TRACKED - Protocol is not being tracked. S2WERR_BUFF_ERROR - Buffer management function returned an error. S2WERR_SRC_ADDRESS - Problem with the source address field. S2WERR_DST_ADDRESS - Problem with destination address field. S2WERR_BAD_BROADCAST - Problem with an attempt to broadcast. S2WERR_BAD_MULTICAST - Problem with an attempt to multicast. S2WERR_MULTICAST_FULL - Multicast address list full. S2WERR_BAD_EVENT - Event specified is unknown. S2WERR_BAD_STATDATA - The S2IO_StatData pointer or the data it points to failed a sanity check. S2WERR_IS_CONFIGURED - Attempt to reconfigure the unit. S2WERR_NULL_POINTER - A NULL pointer was detected in one of the arguments. S2ERR_BAD_ARGUMENT should always be the S2ERR. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
