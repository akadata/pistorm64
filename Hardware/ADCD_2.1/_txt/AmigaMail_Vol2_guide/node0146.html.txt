TITLE: What Am I Running On?

What Am I Running On? ]" border=0> It is possible for applications to detect if they are running on an A570 or on a CDTV player. There is an A570-specific module called "A690ID". A title can test to see if this module is present using the exec.library function FindResident(). If the "A690ID" module is present, the title is running on an A570-equipped A500.
