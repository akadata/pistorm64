CacheControl ]" border=0> exec.library/CacheControl exec.library/CacheControl NAME CacheControl - Instruction & data cache control SYNOPSIS oldBits = CacheControl(cacheBits,cacheMask) D0 D0 D1 ULONG CacheControl(ULONG,ULONG); FUNCTION This function provides global control of any instruction or data caches that may be connected to the system. All settings are global -- per task control is not provided. The action taken by this function will depend on the type of CPU installed. This function may be patched to support external caches, or different cache architectures. In all cases the function will attempt to best emulate the provided settings. Use of this function may save state specific to the caches involved. The list of supported settings is provided in the exec/execbase.i include file. The bits currently defined map directly to the Motorola 68030 CPU CACR register. Alternate cache solutions may patch into the Exec cache functions. Where possible, bits will be interpreted to have the same meaning on the installed cache. INPUTS cacheBits - new values for the bits specified in cacheMask. cacheMask - a mask with ones for all bits to be changed. RESULT oldBits - the complete prior values for all settings. NOTE As a side effect, this function clears all caches.

That is, if the internal data cache is turned on, * the external data cache is turned on. Same for instruction caches. * If the external cache only exists as a single unified cache, * this will turn on if the data cache is on. (This is done for * compatibility reasons) With this bit clear, the external caches * are turned off.
