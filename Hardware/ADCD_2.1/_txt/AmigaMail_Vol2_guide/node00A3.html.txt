OM_NEW ]" border=0> The OM_NEW method receives the following arguments: struct opSet { ULONG MethodID; struct TagItem *ops_AttrList; struct GadgetInfo *ops_GInfo; }; The ops_AttrList field contains a pointer to the TagItem array of attributes for the new object. The ops_GInfo field is always NULL for the OM_NEW method. Unlike other methods, this method is not passed an object pointer (since the whole idea is to create an object). The pointer normally used to pass a boopsi object is instead used to pass the address of the object's "true class" (the class the object is an instance of). That way, all class dispatchers can tell if they are the "true class" of the object being created (as opposed to a superclass of the true class). Also, with this pointer, rootclass can determine what the instance data is for an object, and can allocate the right amount of memory for it. For the OM_NEW method, the new class's dispatcher should do the following: 1) Pass the message along to the superclass. All classes do this as rootclass takes care of allocating memory for the new object. As the OM_NEW method works "top down" (from rootclass down through its subclasses to the true class), each class will in turn initialize its corresponding instance data. This all happens before the new class's dispatcher regains control. Eventually, the message comes back from the superclass with a newly allocated object (unless of course something failed and you receive a NULL pointer instead). 2) Obtain a pointer to the object's instance data for this class. Use the INST_DATA() macro (defined in ). INST_DATA() takes two arguments, a pointer to your class and a pointer to the object. void *INST_DATA(*Class, *Object); 3) Initialize your instance data. You may allocate additional memory buffers for your object, or even create other objects which are components to objects of your class. 4) Process your initial attribute list (from the opSet structure passed in the OM_NEW message). In particular, process all the attributes that can be set only at initialization time. After you deal with the "initialization only" attributes, apply the same attribute processing on these remaining attributes that you would apply to an OM_SET message. 5) Return the object to the caller.
