TITLE: Public Screens

Public Screens ]" border=0> V36 introduces the public screen, a custom screen on which other applications can open their windows. A familiar example of a public screen is the Workbench screen. The public screen provides the ability to create system supported environment alternatives to the Workbench. Opening a public screen is just like opening a custom screen. The only difference is in the tags used when the screen is opened. There must be a SA_PubName tag, with the screen's name as the tag's data. Applications will access the screen by this name. When a public screen is first opened, it is still private to the application that opened it. This will give the program that opened the screen the opportunity to set up before other applications can access the screen. After a public screen is explicitly made public, anybody can put a lock on the screen or open a window on it. Both locks and 'visitor windows' prevent applications from closing their public screens. Intuition keeps track of the number of locks and visitor windows on a public screen by incrementing and decrementing the screen's visitor count. When the number of visitors is zero, the screen can be closed. The following code fragment shows how to open a public screen and change its status from private to public using the Intuition function PubScreenStatus(). if (pubscreen = OpenScreenTags(NULL, SA_DisplayID, HIRES_KEY, SA_Depth, 2, SA_Title, "AmigaMail Test Public Screen", SA_PubName, "AmigaMail Test Public Screen", /* By providing the public name, you indicate it will be public */ SA_Pens, dri_Pens, SA_ErrorCode, &oserror, TAG_END)) { /* change mode from 'private' to 'public' */ oldstatus = PubScreenStatus(pubscreen, 0);} If for any reason Intuition could not open the screen, the error number will be returned in the data portion of the SA_ErrorCode tag (the OpenScreen errors are listed in intuition/screens.h). This error can indicate that the system is out of memory, that the requested display mode is not supported by the video hardware or monitor, or that the public screen name is already being used by another public screen. Some OpenScreen errors can be avoided. Make sure the display mode a screen requires is available (one of the previous examples shows how to find all available display modes). For example, before opening a public screen, make sure its name is not already being used by an existing public screen. Before opening a public screen named ExamplePublicScreen, try to put a lock on a screen with that name using LockPubScreen(). If this call succeeds, the system has found and locked a screen with that name, so you can't use it. If the call fails, the system does not have a screen by that name, indicating that it's OK to open the new screen with that name. An application should make sure it removes all locks on a screen when the screen is no longer needed. If a screen already exists with that name, there are several options available, all of which should reflect user preferences. One option is not to open a screen, using the existing screen instead. For example, if the user double-clicks an application's project icon, the application would check if its public screen is already opened and open windows there before trying to open a new screen. Another option is to open a new screen with a slightly different name. A public screen that would have been named ExamplePublicScreen might instead be called ExamplePublicScreen2. A third option is to quit. In any case, the user should normally be choosing the actions of the application, not the programmer. Programs find specific public screens by their name, so public screens must have a unique name as identification. With a maximum name length of 139 characters, supplying a unique name shouldn't be a problem. This name should reflect the nature of the screen's purpose, if for no other reason, to make it easy to figure out what the screen is used for. Ambiguous names such as "PublicScreen" or "MyScreen" should not be used as they tell nothing about the nature of the screen. Also, more than one "less creative" programmer might be inclined to give such generic names to their public screen, which can confuse both user and application. As a public screen can be used as an alternative to the Workbench environment, programs opening public screens should normally make the screen is at least 640 pixels wide. Many applications assume that the Workbench is at least 640x200 and would be severely crippled if opened on a 320x200 screen. Before a public screen can be closed, it has to be made private again. As long as there are visitors (windows and locks) on a public screen, an attempt to change the screen's status to private will fail. To make closing down public screens easier, Intuition can signal an application when the last visitor 'leaves' a public screen. While waiting to close a locked public screen, an application can start to shut down by unloading code or closing windows. After the screen has been made private again, Intuition removes it from the public screen list. The following code illustrates this. if ((oldstatus = PubScreenStatus(pubscreen, PSNF_PRIVATE)) & PSNF_PRIVATE) CloseScreen(pubscreen); To tell Intuition to signal when all the visitor windows on a public screen have been closed, use the SA_PubSig and SA_PubTask tags when opening the screen. The SA_PubSig data is the number of a signal bit you have allocated. An application can specify which task to signal when all the visitors have left by supplying a pointer to that task with the SA_PubTask tag. If this tag is absent or its data = NULL, the task which opened the public screen will be signaled. When putting up any requesters on a public screen, be sure to supply the requester with a pointer to a visitor window on that screen. This will prevent the requester from popping up on the wrong screen. This will also prevent needless incrementing of the public screen's visitor count as the requester will not be considered a visitor. Prior to release 2.02, UnlockPublicScreen() did not signal when the visitor count reached zero. With release 2.02, UnlockPubScreen() will signal the specified task when the visitor count reaches zero. Under 2.00 and 2.01, only CloseWindow() would signal. There is always a default public screen available. Normally this would be the Workbench, but an application can make its own public screen the default, or better yet, a screen manager utility could let the user choose the default public screen. An application should not automatically make its public screen the default as this might confuse the user and can conflict with user preferences. Because older programs do not know about public screens, The SHANGHAI flag has been provided to 'shanghai' requests to open a window on the Workbench screen, forcing the window to open on the default public screen. Of course, a release 2.0 application that wants to open a window on a specific public screen can do so provided that the specific screen is available. Another flag, POPPUBSCREEN, instructs Intuition to move public screens to the front if a window is opened on it. The SHANGHAI and POPPUBSCREEN flags can be set using PubScreenStatus() but, as the flags are global and should be set according to the preferences of the user, applications should not be changing them. Example 2, Pub.c , shows how to open a public screen, make it the default and shut it down. The example can be found at the end of this article. To aid 'screen manager' utilities, the list of public screens can be locked and copied using LockPubScreenList(). UnlockPubScreenList() will unlock the list. Don't try to interpret the list itself. Instead, copy it and release the lock. To receive an updated copy later on, lock and copy the list again. Lockpub.c is a small example of locking the public screen list.
