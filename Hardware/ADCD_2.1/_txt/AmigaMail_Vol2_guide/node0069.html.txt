TITLE: Patterns

Patterns ]" border=0> An AmigaDOS pattern matching string is a combination of alphanumeric characters and a series of special token characters. These token characters are part of the ASCII character set and they denote such things as string matching wildcards, string repetitions, and string negation. Pattern matching strings can use parentheses to delimit pattern matching substrings. ? The question mark matches any single character. For example, the pattern matching string "A?B" matches any string that is three letters long, that starts with an "A" and ends with a "B". # The number sign matches strings containing zero or more repetitions of the expression that immediately follows the # in the pattern matching string. For example, the pattern matching string "#A" matches any string that consists of one or more of the "A" character. The pattern matching string "#?" matches any non-NULL string. The # can apply to entire substrings delimited by parentheses. For example, the pattern string "#(AB)" matches any string consisting of one or more repetitions of the substring "AB" (AB, ABAB, ABABAB...). % Matches the NULL string. | This is the OR symbol. This matches strings that contain the expressions on either side of the OR sign. The expressions and the OR symbol need to be enclosed in parentheses. For example, the pattern matching string "(A|B)" matches the string "A" or the string "B". The pattern matching string A(B|%|C) matches the strings "AB", "A", and "AC". ~ The tilde negates the expression that follows it. All strings that do not match the expression that follows the tilde will match the expression with the tilde. For example, the pattern matching string "~(#?.info)" matches any string that does not match the string "#?.info" (does not end with the substring ".info"). * The star is provided as an synonym to "#?". This is an option which can be turned on. Note that the star can not be used by itself on all non-FileSystem devices, like a logical device name assigned to a directory on a file system. For example: Assign A: dh0:tmp cd a: list * will produce an error. The SetStar.c example at the end of this article is a small, stand-alone utility to turn this option on and off. [] All characters within brackets indicate a character class. Any character in the character class qualifies. Within a character class, a character range can be indicated by specifing the start and stop character, separated with a minus sign. Note that character classes are case sensitive. If character classes are to be used in a case insensitive form, they should be translated to uppercase. Here are some example: [ACF]#? matches strings starting with `A', `C', or `F' [A-D]#? matches strings starting with `A', `B', `C', or `D' [~ACF]#? matches strings not starting with `A', `C', or `F' ' The quote character neutralizes the special meaning of a special character. Here are some examples: '#'? matches only the literal string "#?" '?(A|B|C|%)'# matches the literal strings "?#", "?A#", "?B#", "?C#" " matches ' () Parentheses group special characters. The expression within the parentheses is a subpattern. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
