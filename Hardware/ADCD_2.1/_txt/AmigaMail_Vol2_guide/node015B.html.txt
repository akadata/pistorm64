TITLE: Warning

Warning ]" border=0> Though these instructions are fairly simple, if not done properly, it is possible to damage both your computer and your video monitor, so Commodore does not recommend that you build these yourself. If you are not proficient with the tools, parts, or procedures involved in making these adapters, you should purchase them in completed form (Commodore part numbers are provided later). This information is provided for your convenience and is expressly subject to the disclaimer and warnings found at the beginning of this publication. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
