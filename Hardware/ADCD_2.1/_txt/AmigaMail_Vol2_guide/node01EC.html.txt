SYNOPSIS error = OpenDevice(unit, IOSana2Req, flags) D0 D0 A1 D1 BYTE OpenDevice(ULONG, struct IOSana2Req *, ULONG); FUNCTION This function is called by exec.library OpenDevice(). This function performs whatever initialization is required per device open and initializes the Sana2Req for use by the device. INPUTS unit - Device unit to open. Sana2Req - Pointer to IOSana2Req structure to be initialized by the sana2.device. flags - Supported flags are: SANA2OPB_MINE SANA2OPB_PROM ios2_BufferManagement - A pointer to a tag list containing pointers to buffer management functions. RESULTS error - same as io_Error io_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. io_Device - A pointer to whatever device will handle the calls for this unit.
