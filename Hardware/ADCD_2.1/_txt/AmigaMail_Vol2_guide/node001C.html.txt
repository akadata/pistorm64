TITLE: General Compatibility Problem Areas

General Compatibility Problem Areas ]" border=0> One sure fire way to write incompatible software is to fail to follow the Amiga programming guidelines listed in the beginning of your Amiga ROM Kernel and Amiga Hardware manuals. Please read the guidelines and follow them! The following improper Amiga programming practices are likely to fail on new ROMs or hardware: * Calling ROM code directly. * Directly or indirectly reading or writing random memory addresses or low memory (especially location zero) due to improperly initialized pointers or structures. Use Mungwall and Enforcer when writing and testing your code! * Assuming addresses/location/amounts of RAM or system structures. * Requiring all free RAM. * Mishandling 32-bit addresses. For example, using signed math or signed comparisons on addresses, or doing a BOOL or WORD test to determine if a pointer is non-zero. * Overwriting memory allocations. With 32-bit addresses, a 1-byte overwrite of a string array can wipe out the high byte of a pointer or stack return address. This bug could go unnoticed on a 24-bit address machine (eg. A500,A2500, etc) but crash the system or cause other problems on an A3000. * Shaving stack size too close. System function stack usage changes with each OS release. o Improper flags or garbage in system structures. A bit that means nothing under one OS may drastically change the behavior of a function in a newer version of the OS. Clear structures before using, and use correct flags. * Passing garbage in previously unused upper bytes of function arguments (for example-the upper word of the ULONG AvailFonts() Flags parameter). * Improper register or condition code handling. Do not assume registers D0-D1/A0-A1 are preserved after system calls! Some function calls happen to preserve some registers. This can change in any revisions of the OS. In some cases we have modifed the values returned in registers to keep certain applications from failing under 2.0. We do not guarantee those modifications will remain in place. Condition codes are also in an undefined state on the return from a system call. Assembler code must test (TST,MOVE,CMP,etc.) D0 results before branching on condition codes. Use Scratch by Bill Hawes (via the scratchall script) to catch scratch register misuse in assembler code. * Misuse of function return values. Use function prototypes and read the Autodocs for the functions you are using. Some system functions return just success or failure, or nothing at all (void). In such cases, the value which the function happens to return must not be used except as it is documented. * Calling system library functions from assembler without placing the library base pointer in A6. All system functions may assume that their library's base pointer is in A6. A function's need to reference its library base can change in different OS revisions. * Depending on unsupported side effects or undocumented behavior. Be sure to read the RKM chapters, Autodocs, and include file comments. * Poking/peeking system private structures. Do not poke or peek any system structure unless told to do so in official Commodore documentation. * Assuming current choices, configurations or initial values. If the current possibilities are A, B, or C, do not assume C if it isn't A or B. Check specifically for the choices currently implemented, and provide default behavior for unexpected values. * Failure to properly allocate resources before using them. * Failure to properly close/deallocate resources. * Improper reading/writing of hardware registers. You must mask out bits you are not interested in on reads, and write undefined bits as zero. * Assuming initial values of hardware registers. If you are going direct to the hardware, do not depend on the initial values of any hardware registers. The settings may not be the same on different versions of the OS or from boot to boot. Always set up all of the hardware registers that affect your code. o Processor speed dependencies such as software delay loops. * Processor instruction dependencies. Do not use instructions which are privileged on any Motorola 68xxx family processor. Do not use CLR on a hardware register which is triggered by any access (use MOVE #0 instead). The 68000 CLR instruction performs two accesses (Read, then Write). The 68020 and higher CLR instruction performs just one access. * Depending on or failing to account for cache or prefetch effects. Self-modifying or trackdisk-loaded code requires cache flushes ( see the exec.library/CacheClearU() function ). Amiga debugging tools such as Enforcer, Mungwall, and Scratch can find many program bugs that may affect compatibility. A program that is Enforcer/Mungwall/Scratch clean stands a much better chance of working well under current and future versions of the OS. These tools are on the Denver/Milano DevCon disks. Enforcer and Mungwall are also on the kickfile disks. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
