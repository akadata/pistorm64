TITLE: Using Enforcer and Mungwall Together

Using Enforcer and Mungwall Together ]" border=0> Alone, Mungwall can catch a large variety of memory-related software problems. If Mungwall and Enforcer are used together, they can catch many more well-hidden bugs. One bug that is hard to catch is when a program either mistakenly reads memory that does not belong to the program or reads its own memory without initializing the memory first. These bugs are normally hard to catch because the behavior of the errant program usually depends on how it reacts to the data that happens to be stored in that memory. This makes the behavior of the bug erratic. Sometimes the errant program may crash. Sometimes the errant program may write over another program's data, causing the other program to crash. At other times, no noticeable abnormality takes place. Mungwall and Enforcer together can help find these bugs. Because Mungwall fills freed memory with the same odd 32-bit values, when an errant program mistakenly accesses memory, the behavior of the bug will be consistent while Mungwall is running. Also, the values Mungwall puts in memory are more likely to cause the errant program to access Enforcer-protected memory, triggering an Enforcer hit. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
