Many of the Exec device standard commands are no-ops in SANA-II devices, but this may not always be the case. For example, CMD_RESET might someday be used for dynamically reconfiguring hardware. This should present no compatibility problems for properly written drivers. Broadcast and Multicast Configuration Stats On-line [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
