icclass ]" border=0> Class: icclass Superclass: rootclass Description: Base class of simple forwarding interconnection. Include File: New Methods: ------------ ICM_SETLOOP ICM_CLEARLOOP ICM_CHECKLOOP - All of these methods are used internally by subclasses to manage a loop inhibition for broadcasted messages. They increment, decrement, and return the value of that counter. Changed Methods: ---------------- OM_SET - Sets attributes and returns 0. Note that this is not the same behavior as OM_NOTIFY. OM_NOTIFY - Issues an OM_UPDATE message to the object indicated by attribute ICA_Target, first converting the attribute tags according to the ICA_Map attribute. The internal loop count is incremented until the OM_UPDATE method it invokes on ICA_Target returns. Also, it will do nothing at all if that loop count was non-zero to begin with, preventing itself from participating in an infinite loop. OM_UPDATE - Receive update notices from others. This base IC class just passes the message along, treating it exactly like an OM_NOTIFY message. Subclasses will probably redefine this method to perform a calculation, the result of which they might forward to others by issuing themselves an OM_NOTIFY message. Unfortunately, this class converts the OM_SET and OM_NOTIFY messages to an OM_NOTIFY by changing their MethodID field, and does not restore it to what it originally was. Attributes: ----------- ICA_Target (IS) Target object for OM_UPDATE messages. If this attribute is given the value ICTARGET_IDCMP, then the notification will consist of sending an IDCMPUPDATE IntuiMessage to a window. The window is determined by the GadgetInfo structure passed around when the object is connected to gadgets. ICA_Map (IS) Attribute mapping list. ICSPECIAL_CODE (*) This is a magic dummy attribute: if it occurs as a target in the ICA_Map mapping list, and ICA_Target is ICTARGET_IDCMP, then the new value of the corresponding attribute will be copied into the IntuiMessage.Code field of the IDCMPUPDATE message (just the lower sixteen bits of the attribute value will fit). This sometimes makes it particularly simple to process IDCMPUPDATE messages with a single item of interest. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
