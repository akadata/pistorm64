frbuttonclass ]" border=0> Class: frbuttonclass Superclass: buttongclass Description: A button gadget that knows how to outline its "label" within a shared "frame image". New Methods: ------------ None. Changed Methods: ---------------- OM_NEW - Will set up its dimensions depending on GA_Image, including support for frame images. If GA_Image understands the IM_FRAMEBOX method, dimensions are calculated to surround the "label" stashed in GadgetText, which can be GA_IntuiText, GA_Text, or GA_LabelImage. OM_SET - If you change the dimensions, this method will adjust the contents by using IM_FRAMEBOX with FRAMEIF_SPECIFY. GM_HITTEST - uses IM_HITFRAME. GM_RENDER - uses IM_DRAWFRAME. First draws the frame, then draws the contents or label described under OM_NEW. Attributes: ----------- GA_Width (IS) GA_Height (IS) If you change these, the contents will be readjusted and the gadget re- rendered. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
