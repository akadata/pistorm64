TITLE: V-15: Amiga Font Scaling and Aspect Ratio

V-15: Amiga Font Scaling and Aspect Ratio ]" border=0> by John Orr [Editor's Note: This article assumes the reader is familiar with how the Amiga stores and manages bitmap fonts under pre-2.0 Releases of the operating system. For more information, see the "Graphics: Text" chapter of the RKM:Libraries and Devices Manual.] The Release 2.0 OS offers a significant improvement over the Amiga's previous font resources: it now has the ability to scale fonts to new sizes and dimensions. This means, if the diskfont.library can't find the font size an application requests, it can create a new bitmap font by scaling the bitmap of a different size font in the same font family. The 2.04 release of the OS improved upon the diskfont.library's font scaling ability so the Amiga now can utilize AGFA/Compugraphic outline fonts, yielding scalable fonts that don't have the exaggerated jagged edges inherent in bitmap scaling. The best thing about the Amiga's font scaling is that its addition to the system is completely invisible to an application program. Because the diskfont.library takes care of all the font scaling, any program that uses OpenDiskFont() to open a font can have scalable fonts available to it. For simple scaling, the programming interface is the same using Release 2.0 as it was under 1.3. However, there is one feature of the 2.0 diskfont.library that the 1.3 programming interface cannot handle. When scaling a font (either from an outline or from another bitmap), the 2.0 diskfont.library can adjust the width of a font's glyphs according to an aspect ratio passed to OpenDiskFont(). A font glyph is the graphical representations associated with each symbol or character of a font. The aspect ratio refers to the shape of the pixels that make up the bitmap that diskfont.library creates when it scales a font. This ratio is the width of a pixel to the height of the pixel (XWidth/YWidth). The diskfont.library uses this ratio to figure out how wide to make the font glyphs so that the look of a font's glyphs will be the same on display modes with very different aspect ratios. For more information on Amiga aspect ratios, see Carolyn Scheppner's article, ``Finding the Aspect Ratio'', from the September/October 1991 issue of Amiga Mail. To add this new feature, several changes to the OS were necessary: 1) The OS needed to be able to store an aspect ratio for any font loaded into the system list, 2) The structures that diskfont.library uses to store bitmap fonts on disk had to be updated so they can store the aspect ratio a font was designed for, and, 3) The way in which an application requests fonts from diskfont.library had to be altered so that an application could askfor a specific aspect ratio. For the diskfont.library to be able to scale a font to a new aspect ratio, it needs to know what the font's current aspect ratio is. The Amiga gets the aspect ratio of a font currently in the system list from an extension to the TextFont structure called (oddly enough) TextFontExtension. Under 2.0, when the system opens a new font (and there is sufficient memory), it creates this extension. A font's TextFont structure contains a pointer to its associated TextFontExtension. While the font is opened, the TextFont's tf_Message.mn_ReplyPort field points to a font's TextFontExtension. The include file #defines tf_Message.mn_ReplyPort as tf_Extension. The TextFontExtension structure contains only one field of interest: a pointer to a tag list associated with this font: struct TagItem *tfe_Tags; /* Text Tags for the font */ If a font has an aspect ratio associated with it, the OS stores the aspect ratio as a tag/value pair in the tfe_Tags tag list. The TA_DeviceDPI tag holds a font's aspect ratio. The data portion of the TA_DeviceDPI tag contains an X DPI (dots per inch) value in its upper word and a Y DPI value in its lower word. These values are unsigned words (UWORD). At present, these values do not necessarily reflect the font's true X and Y DPI, so their specific values are not relevant. At present, only the ratio of the X aspect to the Y aspect is important (more on this later in the article). Notice that the X and Y DPI values are not aspect values. The X and Y aspect values are the reciprocals of the X and Y DPI values, respectively: XDPI = 1/XAspect YDPI = 1/YAspect so, the aspect ratio is YDPI/XDPI, not XDPI/YDPI. Before accessing the tag list, an application should make sure that this font has a corresponding TextFontExtension. The ExtendFont() function will return a value of TRUE if this font already has an extension or ExtendFont() was able to create an extension for this font. Where Do the X and Y DPI values Come From?
