Boopsi Rootclass Methods ]" border=0> Since all classes should be subclasses of some class, with the exception of rootclass, all classes you write will be subclasses--perhaps indirectly so--of rootclass. Because of this, your class must either implement the rootclass methods or defer processing of these methods to the superclass (as DispatchmyTextLabel() did). Provided below are brief descriptions of the rootclass methods. Remember that any message unrecognized by a class dispatcher should be passed to the superclass (using the amiga.lib functions DSM() or DoSuperMethod() ). The rootclass method IDs that a subclass of imageclass needs to understand are: OM_NEW Create a new object. OM_DISPOSE Delete an object. OM_SET Change an object's attributes. OM_GET Retrieve the value of one of the object's attributes. The dispatcher should pass other rootclass methods on to the superclass. Each method requires one or more parameters. The MethodID is the only common parameter for each method. OM_NEW OM_DISPOSE OM_SET OM_GET [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
