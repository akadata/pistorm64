FONS (0x464F4E53) / Font chunk (Same as FTXT FONS chunk) / ]" border=0> The FONS chunk contains information about a font used in the DR2D FORM. ProVector does not include support for Amiga fonts. Instead, ProVector uses fonts defined in the OFNT FORM which is documented later in this article. struct FONSstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; UBYTE FontID; /* ID the font is referenced by */ UBYTE Pad1; /* Always 0 */ UBYTE Proportional; /* Is it proportional? */ UBYTE Serif; /* does it have serifs? */ CHAR Name[Size-4]; /* The name of the font */ }; The UBYTE FontID field is the number DR2D assigns to this font. References to this font by other DR2D chunks are made using this number. The Proportional and Serif fields indicate properties of this font. Specifically, Proportional indicates if this font is proportional, and Serif indicates if this font has serifs. These two options were created to allow for font substitution in case the specified font is not available. They are set according to these values: 0 The DR2D writer didn't know if this font is proportional/has serifs. 1 No, this font is not proportional/does not have serifs. 2 Yes, this font is proportional/does have serifs. The last field, Name[], is a NULL terminated string containing the name of the font. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
