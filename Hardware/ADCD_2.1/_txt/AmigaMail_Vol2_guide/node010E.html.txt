Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-468505-9 If you want more detail on how the protocols work (especially how they support internetworking), this is the place to look. Little programming information is in this volume. Comer, D.E. and Stevens, D.L. (1991b), Internetworking with TCP/IP, Volume II: Design, Implementation and Internals. Prentice-Hall, ISBM 0-13-472242-6. There is more detail here than most application developers will want or need, but some subjects (i.e., Out-Of-Band data) are covered here better than in any other text. The text includes a complete TCP/IP implementation for Xinu. It should be easily understandable by Amiga developers, in part, because Xinu happens to have a rather Exec-like IPC mechanism. Stevens, W.R. (1990), Unix Network Programming. Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-949876-1. This book starts at the beginning and methodically leads the reader through many advanced topics. If it weren't for the fact that it serves as a reference and a tutorial, it could be thought of as the RKMs for AS225 software development. It introduces network protocols in some detail, and sockets in great detail. It includes source and discussion of several real-world examples: ping, tftp, rlogin, lpr, rcmd, rmt, etc. Everyone in the Amiga Networking group owns a copy. RFCs ---- All Internet standards start life as Requests For Comments. They are still called RFCs even if they become required, recommended, or elective. If you wish to implement a standard Internet application, you should obtain any currently applicable RFC(s) and study them closely. Here is one way to obtain RFCs: CSNET: ------ CSNET Coordination and Information Center (CIC) Hotline: (617) 873-2777 10 Moulton Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 Email: cic@sh.cs.net Info-Server requests to: info-server@sh.cs.net The CSNET Info-Server stocks all RFCs with numbers higher than 900, unless (like RFC 900) they have been obsoleted by later RFCs. The Info-Server also stocks selected RFCs with numbers lower than 900. The CSNET Info-Server is an automatic program that delivers information by electronic mail. To order a document from the Info-Server, send a message to "info-server@sh.cs.net". You do not need a subject field. The text of your message must be in a special format, such as: REQUEST: rfc TOPIC: heLP Topic: RFC822 request: END The text may any combination of upper-case and lower-case letters. The above request asks for two documents "HELP" and "RFC822" from the collection "RFC". Your message must have a "REQUEST" line, and one or more "TOPIC:" lines to specify one or more documents. The optional statement "REQUEST: END" terminates your specification. Any subsequent text in the message is ignored by the Info-Server. NOTICE: ------- The Topic: field must be of the form "rfc822", and NOT "822" or "rfc822.txt". [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
