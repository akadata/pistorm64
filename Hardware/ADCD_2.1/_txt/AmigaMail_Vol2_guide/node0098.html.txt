TITLE: Opening Full Sized Windows

Opening Full Sized Windows ]" border=0> Because there is no guarantee that GetScreenData() will return the correct screen resolution, programs can't use it to obtain the dimensions needed to open a full sized window. To get the correct screen resolution of the Workbench screen, programs have to examine the Height and Width fields of the Screen structure returned by LockPubScreen(). To make supporting new and old versions of the operating system easier, Intuition V36 offers a way to open screens and windows that is compatible with previous versions of the Amiga OS. Instead of requiring the use of new functions to open V36 specific screens and windows, the OpenWindow() and OpenScreen() functions each accept an extended structure, ExtNewWindow and ExtNewScreen, respectively. These structures allow the programmer to pass tags to the V36 OpenScreen() and OpenWindow() functions while remaining compatible with older versions of these functions. Older versions of Intuition ignore the excess baggage at the end of the structure where the tags are kept. These tags are partially used in V35 (a 1.3 release) to support the A2024 modes. Note that the ExtNewScreen and ExtNewWindow structures may be extended in the future, so programs must not assume their size is static. To use the "New Look", pass the SA_Pens tag and a pen array in ExtNewScreen. Using the New Look requires a little bit more responsibility from an application. Programs that aren't careful can experience problems with the layout of graphics and gadgets in New Look windows and screens. For example, a lot of programs made assumptions about the height of a window's title bar. Under 1.3, this didn't present much of a problem because the title bar height didn't normally change. Under 2.0, the user can choose system fonts, varying the size of the title bar. Graphics and gadgets rendered into the application's window can write over the title bar if the application isn't careful. The example at the end of this article, extscreen.c , illustrates how to open a screen and window under release 2.0, using 2.0 specific features if they are available, while staying compatible with older versions of the operating system. This example will open a screen in A2024 mode (under V37, V36, or V35) if the resources are available. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
