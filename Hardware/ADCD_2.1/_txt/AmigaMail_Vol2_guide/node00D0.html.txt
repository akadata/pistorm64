TITLE: Starting the Engine

Starting the Engine ]" border=0> There are several steps involved in using a font outline on the Amiga. Step 1. Open the font contents file (the ".font" file) and verify that it has a corresponding outline tag file (an ".otag" file). Step 2. Open the otag file, verify that it is valid, load its tag list into memory, and resolve any memory indirections in the tag list. Step 3. Find out the name of the typeface's scaling engine and obtain a pointer to the engine's GlyphEngine structure. Step 4. Tell the engine which typeface to use. Step 5. Set other scaling engine parameters. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
