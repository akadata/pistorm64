This function is primarily intended for writers of DMA device drivers. The action will depend on the CPU type installed, caching modes, and the state of any Memory Management Unit (MMU) activity. As implemented 68000 - Do nothing 68010 - Do nothing 68020 - Do nothing 68030 - Flush the data cache 68040 - Flush matching areas of the data cache ????? - External cache boards, Virtual Memory Systems, or future hardware may patch this vector to best emulate the intended behavior. With a Bus-Snooping CPU, this function my end up doing nothing. INPUTS address - Same as initially passed to CachePreDMA length - Same as initially passed to CachePreDMA flags - Values: DMA_NoModify - If the area was not modified (and thus there is no reason to flush the cache) set this bit.
