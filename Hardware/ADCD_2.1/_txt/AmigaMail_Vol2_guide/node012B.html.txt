TITLE: Building the +2 Interface

Building the +2 Interface ]" border=0> The interface that these two extra joystick ports require is quite straightforward in design and does not require any power. Essentially, two male 9-pin "d-sub" connectors (the type commonly used for joystick ports) are wired directly to a 25-pin "d-sub" connector. The gender of the 25-pin connector depends on the Amiga model. Amiga 1000 computers have a non-standard, male 25-pin parallel port, so the Amiga 1000 adapters will need a female connector. All other Amigas have standard female 25-pin parallel ports, so adapters for A500, A600, A2000, A3000, A3000T, and CDTV units should have a male 25-pin connector. The only difference between the requirements for the A1000 "+2" adapter and the "+2" adapter for the rest of the Amiga/CDTV product line is the gender. The "+2" adapter only uses parallel port pins that all Amigas/CDTVs have in common. These particular pins were chosen so that one "+2" adapter and a gender changer could connect two joysticks to any existing Amiga. Because some of the unused pins carry voltages, only wire the pins specified in the chart! Doing otherwise can destroy components inside the Amiga!
