Where Do the X and Y DPI values Come From? ]" border=0> The Amiga has a place to store a font's X and Y DPI values once the font is loaded into memory, but where do these X and Y values come from? A font's X and Y DPI values can come from several sources. The X and YDPI can come from a font's disk-based representation, or it can be set by the programmer. For the traditional Amiga bitmap fonts, in order to store the X and Y DPI values in a bitmap font's .font file, the structures that make up the .font file had to be expanded slightly. There are two changes from the structures described in the ``Graphics:Text'' chapter of the RKM: Libraries and Devices manual. The first is that the fch_FileID in the FontContentsHeader structure (essentially, the .font file) contains a different file ID (TFCH_ID from ) from the traditional .font file. This tells the diskfont.library that this FontContentsHeader uses a special kind of FontContents structure called a TFontContents structure. The difference between these structures is that the TFontContents structure allows the OS to store tag value pairs in the extra space set aside for the font's name. struct TFontContents { char tfc_FileName[MAXFONTPATH-2]; UWORD tfc_TagCount; /* including the TAG_DONE tag */ /* * if tfc_TagCount is non-zero, tfc_FileName is overlayed with * Text Tags starting at: (struct TagItem *) * &tfc_FileName[MAXFONTPATH-(tfc_TagCount*sizeof(struct TagItem))] */ UWORD tfc_YSize; UBYTE tfc_Style; UBYTE tfc_Flags; }; Currently, out of all the system standard bitmap fonts (ones loaded from bitmaps on disk or ROM, not scaled from a bitmap or outline), only one has a built in aspect ratio: Topaz-9. For the Compugraphic outline fonts, the X and Y DPI values are built into the font outline. Because the format of the Compugraphic outline fonts is proprietary, information about their layout is available only from AGFA/Compugraphic. For most people, the format of the outline fonts is not important, as the diskfont.library handles converting the fonts to an Amiga-usable form. The other place where a font can get an aspect ratio is an application. When an application opens a font with OpenDiskFont(), it can supply the TA_DeviceDPI tag that the diskfont.library uses to scale (if necessary) the font according to the aspect ratio. To do so, an application has to pass OpenDiskFont() an extended version of the TextAttr structure called the TTextAttr: struct TTextAttr { STRPTR tta_Name; /* name of the font */ UWORD tta_YSize; /* height of the font */ UBYTE tta_Style; /* intrinsic font style */ UBYTE tta_Flags; /* font preferences and flags */ struct TagItem *tta_Tags; /* extended attributes */ }; The TextAttr and the TTextAttr are identical except that the tta_Tags field points to a tag list where you place your TA_DeviceDPI tag. To tell OpenDiskFont() that it has a TTextAttr structure rather than a TextAttr structure, set the FSF_TAGGED bit in the tta_Style field. For example, to ask for Topaz-9 scaled to an aspect ratio of 75 to 50, the code might look something like this: ... #define MYXDPI (75L tf_Extension))->tfe_Tags); if (dpivalue) printf("XDPI = %d YDPI = %d\n", ((dpivalue & 0xFFFF0000)>>16), (dpivalue & 0x0000FFFF)); /* blah, blah, render some text, blah, blah */ ... CloseFont(myfont); } ... } From FTA.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
