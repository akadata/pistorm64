Supporting the Interface in Software ]" border=0> Because this "+2" joystick adapter attaches to the parallel port, supporting it in software is simply a matter of reading the correct lines on the parallel port. Many Amiga game programmers make the decision to throw away the OS and directly manipulate the hardware. These programmers will no doubt come up with their own personal scheme for reading the appropriate information from the port. Other, more forward thinking developers, may want to write their software in such a way as to be compatible with the OS. The following pair of code samples work in tandem to demonstrate one method of reading the necessary information from the parallel port in an OS friendly manner. The C program 4play.c is a simple example that demonstrates how to access the assembly functions. The assembly language program read34.asm properly allocates the parallel port and any necessary signal lines, warning the OS not to let any other applications use them. Other assembly routines do the actual hardware level reading and place the joystick values into C variables. A cleanup routine releases the port and signal lines. The example does not mask out the directional or fire button bits, it only prints the raw joystick data. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to interpret the meaning of the raw data. lmkfile [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
