TITLE: Who Should Use Enforcer and Mungwall

Who Should Use Enforcer and Mungwall ]" border=0> If you are developing Amiga software, it is extremely important that you invest in a MMU, or at the very least make sure that your software is tested on machines with Enforcer and Mungwall (also test with Enforcer alone as Mungwall can hide certain types of bugs). If you are programming in assembly, you should also test with Scratch by Bill Hawes to catch improper usage of CPU registers. Enforcer and Mungwall are not just for developers and QA departments. Anyone who uses software can help find bugs in it with Enforcer. During normal usage, they can catch hidden software problems. Many people at Commodore run Enforcer all of the time. As more and more people begin running these tools, they will become less tolerant of software that causes Enforcer and Mungwall hits. At a small developer meeting at a recent Amiga trade show, CATS was disappointed to discover that, although the majority of the audience believed that they needed Enforcer, a relatively small percentage of them owned the equipment necessary to run it (i.e., an MMU). If you don't have an MMU, get one. The investment in an A3000, 68030 card, or 68020+MMU card will quickly pay for itself. It significantly cuts down development time because it quickly catches bugs that are otherwise hard to track down. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
