IX-1: Four Can Play-Supporting Parallel Port Joysticks ]" border=0> by Chris Ludwig One of the many reasons people buy computer-based products is to use them as an "entertainment box". Amiga users are no exception in this regard. The Amiga has all the ingredients needed to be a great game machine; fast high-quality graphics, high-fidelity stereo sound, fast processor, and built-in joystick ports. With this level of hardware support, it's no wonder that some of the industry's best games continue to be written for the Amiga first. The only kind of games that don't currently lend themselves to the Amiga's built-in hardware are those that are meant to be played by more than two players simultaneously. Several types of games fall into this category, the most notable being the scrolling cooperative. This type of game, where up to four players control on-screen versions of themselves, is quite popular in video arcades. Another format that lends itself to having more than two joysticks is the board game simulation. It's simply easier to play a four player board game if each player has his or her own control. Because the Amiga has only two joystick ports, there are currently only a small number of "greater than two" player games available. So how do these games get around the two port limitation? The developers of these games have worked up a little bit of external hardware that remaps some parallel port input lines as two more joystick ports for single button joysticks. Fortunately, these developers are all using the same wiring in their interfaces. Unfortunately, neither the interface nor its specifications have been widely available. This article explains the construction of these parallel port joystick adapters (this article refers to them "+2" adapters), and demonstrates a coding strategy which will allow your software to access these two new ports. Though the instructions are fairly simple, if not done properly, it is possible to damage your computer, so Commodore does not recommend that you build these yourself.
