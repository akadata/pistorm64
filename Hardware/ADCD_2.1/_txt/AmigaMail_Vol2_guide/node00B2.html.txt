IV-59: AppWindows, AppIcons, and AppMenuItems ]" border=0> By Fred Mitchell and John Orr Since its inception, the Workbenchä has had a limitation. Although it is a fairly powerful user interface, that power is not accessible to application programs. The power is limited to an interface that only launches other programs. After Workbench launches a program, the program no longer has any ties to the Workbench GUI. If an application needs an iconic interface, it has to create its own, independent of Workbench. Workbench 2.0 is different. Through the workbench.library, applications can utilize the iconic interface of Workbench 2.0. There are three elements to this interface: AppWindows, AppIcons, and AppMenuItems. In this article, they are referred to as AppObjects. When the user drops a Workbench icon onto a special kind of application window called an AppWindow, Workbench sends a message to the application that created the AppWindow. This message contains a complete list of the icons that the user dropped on the window. This is useful for an application like an editor. The editor can open an Intuition window on the Workbench screen and make it into an AppWindow so that when the user drops an icon on the AppWindow, the editor will load the icon's corresponding file. The IconEdit utility that comes on the 2.0 release disks does this. An application can also create its own icons for the Workbench window. These icons are called AppIcons. They are similar to AppWindows in that Workbench will tell an application what icons the user dropped on its AppIcon. In addition, Workbench will notify the application if the user double-clicks the AppIcon. This makes AppIcons useful not only as a "drop box" (like an AppWindow), but they can also be used as some sort of activator for an application. For example, a word processor that opens a window on the Workbench can use an AppIcon to "iconify" its window. When the user wants to get rid of a cumbersome window, he iconifies it, which gets rid of the window and leaves an AppIcon on the Workbench window in its place. When the user wants the window back, he double-clicks the AppIcon and the window reappears. The release 2.0 Workbench has a special menu called "Tools". It is special because unlike the other Workbench menus, any application can add its own menu items to this menu. These menu items are called AppMenuItems. Like the AppIcon, the AppMenu can be used both as an activator and as a "drop box". When the user selects one of these menu items, Workbench sends a message to the application that created the AppMenuItem. If there were any icons selected when the user selected the AppMenuItem, the application will also get a list of those icons.
