TITLE: Ethernet Packet Types

Ethernet Packet Types ]" border=0> Ethernet has a special problem with packet types. Two types of ethernet frames can be sent over the same wire--ethernet and 802.3. These frames differ in that the Type field of an ethernet frame is the Length field of an 802.3 frame. This creates a problem in that demultiplexing incoming packets can be cumbersome and inefficient, as well as requiring driver users to be aware of the frame type used. All 802.3 frames have numbers less than 1500 in the Type field. The only frames with numbers less than 1500 in the type field are 802.3 frames. SANA-II ethernet drivers abnormally return packets contained in ethernet frames when the requested Type falls within the 802.3 range--if the Type requested is within the 802.3 range, the driver returns the next packet contained within an 802.3 frame, regardless of the type specified for the packet within the 802.3 frame. This requires that there be no more than one driver user requesting 802.3 packets and that it do its own interpretation of the frames. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
