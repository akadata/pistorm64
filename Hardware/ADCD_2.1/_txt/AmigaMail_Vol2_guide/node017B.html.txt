TABLE OF CONTENTS asyncio/CloseAsync asyncio/OpenAsync asyncio/ReadAsync asyncio/ReadAsyncChar asyncio/WriteAsync asyncio/WriteAsyncChar asyncio/CloseAsync asyncio/CloseAsync NAME CloseAsync -- close an async io file. SYNOPSIS result = CloseAsync(file); LONG CloseAsync(struct AsyncFile *); FUNCTION Closes a file, flushing any pending writes. Once this call has been made, the file can no longer be accessed. INPUTS file - the file to close. May be NULL. RESULT result - = 0 for success. Indicates whether closing the file worked or not. If the file was opened in read-mode, then this call will always work. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync, dos.library/Close() asyncio/OpenAsync asyncio/OpenAsync NAME OpenAsync -- open a file for asynchronous IO. SYNOPSIS file = OpenAsync(fileName, accessMode, bufferSize); struct AsyncFile OpenAsync(STRPTR, UBYTE, LONG); FUNCTION The named file is opened and an async file handle returned. If the accessMode is MODE_READ, an existing file is opened for reading. If the value is MODE_WRITE, a new file is created for writing. If a file of the same name already exists, it is first deleted. If accessMode is MODE_APPEND, an existing file is prepared for writing. Data written is added to the end of the file. If the file does not exists, it is created. 'fileName' is a filename and CANNOT be a simple device such as NIL:, a window specification such as CON: or RAW:, or "*". 'bufferSize' specifies the size of the IO buffer to use. There are in fact two buffers allocated, each of roughly (bufferSize/2) bytes in size. The actual buffer size use can vary slightly as the size is rounded to speed up DMA. If the file cannot be opened for any reason, the value returned will be NULL, and a secondary error code will be available by calling the routine dos.library/IoErr(). INPUTS name - name of the file to open accessMode - one of MODE_READ, MODE_WRITE, or MODE_APPEND bufferSize - size of IO buffer to use. 8192 is recommended as it provides very good performance for relatively little memory. RESULTS file - an async file handle or NULL for failure. You should not access the fields in the AsyncFile structure, these are private to the async IO routines. In case of failure, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO CloseAsync(), dos.library/Open() asyncio/ReadAsync asyncio/ReadAsync NAME ReadAsync -- read bytes from an async file. SYNOPSIS actualLength = ReadAsync(file,buffer,numBytes); LONG ReadAsync(struct AsyncFile *file, APTR buffer, LONG numBytes); FUNCTION Read() reads bytes of information from an opened async file into the buffer given. 'numBytes' is the number of bytes to read from the file. The value returned is the length of the information actually read. So, when 'actualLength' is greater than zero, the value of 'actualLength' is the the number of characters read. Usually ReadAsync() will try to fill up your buffer before returning. A value of zero means that end-of-file has been reached. Errors are indicated by a value of -1. INPUTS file - opened file to read, as obtained from OpenAsync() buffer - buffer where to put bytes read numBytes - number of bytes to read into buffer RESULT actualLength - actual number of bytes read, or -1 if an error. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), WriteAsync(), ReadCharAsync(), dos.library/Read() asyncio/ReadCharAsync asyncio/ReadCharAsync NAME ReadCharAsync -- read a single byte from an async file. SYNOPSIS byte = ReadCharAsync(file); LONG ReadCharAsync(struct AsyncFile *file); FUNCTION This function reads a single byte from an async file. The byte is returned, or -1 if there was an error reading, or if the end-of-file was reached. INPUTS file - opened file to read from, as obtained from OpenAsync() RESULT byte - the byte read, or -1 if no byte was read. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), WriteCharAsync(), ReadAsync() dos.library/Read() asyncio/WriteAsync asyncio/WriteAsync NAME WriteAsync -- write data to an async file. SYNOPSIS actualLength = WriteAsync(file,buffer,numBytes); LONG WriteAsync(struct AsyncFile *file, APTR buffer, LONG numBytes); FUNCTION WriteAsync() writes bytes of data to an opened async file. 'numBytes' indicates the number of bytes of data to be transferred. 'buffer' points to the data to write. The value returned is the length of information actually written. So, when 'numBytes' is greater than zero, the value of 'numBytes' is the number of characters written. Errors are indicated by a value of -1. INPUTS file - an opened file, as obtained from OpenAsync() buffer - address of data to write numBytes - number of bytes to write to the file RESULT actualLength - number of bytes written, or -1 if error. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), ReadAsync(), WriteCharAsync(), dos.library/Write asyncio/WriteCharAsync asyncio/WriteCharAsync NAME WriteCharAsync -- write a single byte to an async file. SYNOPSIS result = WriteCharAsync(file,byte); LONG WriteCharAsync(struct AsyncFile *, UBYTE byte); FUNCTION This function write a single byte to an async file. INPUTS file - an opened async file, as obtained from OpenAsync() byte - byte of data to add to the file RESULT result - 1 if the byte was written, -1 if there was an error. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. SEE ALSO OpenAsync(), CloseAsync(), ReadAsync(), WriteCharAsync(), dos.library/Write [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
