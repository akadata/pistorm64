TITLE: Step 3

Step 3 ]" border=0> One of the level 1 outline tags is the OT_Engine tag. This tag refers to the name of this typeface's scaling engine. At present there is only one scaling engine available on the Amiga. It is named Bullet. This is the IntelliFont scaling engine. The name is left over from the original implementation of the IntelliFont engine used on the Amiga. The scaling engine itself is in its own Exec library, called bullet.library. To open the engine, build a complete library name by adding the string ".library" to the OT_Engine string, and open it with OpenLibrary(). Don't assume that OT_Engine will always be the string ``bullet''. In the future, Commodore or some third party developer may create additional scaling engines libraries that will allow the Amiga to use other types of outline typefaces (PostScript, Nimbus-Q, etc.). Using the proper library name will help ensure compatibility with future possible scaling engines. All scaling engine libraries contain several functions: OpenEngine() If successful, returns a pointer to the library's GlyphEngine structure. CloseEngine() Releases the GlyphEngine structure obtained in OpenEngine(). SetInfo()/SetInfoA() Sets current parameters of a scaling engine (the current typeface, the current point size, the current output resolution, etc.) ObtainInfo()/ObtainInfoA() Queries a scaling engine for glyph information (a glyph's bitmap, the kerning value between two glyphs, etc.). ReleaseInfo()/ReleaseInfoA() Releases data obtained with ObtainInfo()/ObtainInfoA(). To obtain a pointer to a GlyphEngine structure for a particular scaling library, use that library's OpenEngine() routine. The function takes no arguments. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
