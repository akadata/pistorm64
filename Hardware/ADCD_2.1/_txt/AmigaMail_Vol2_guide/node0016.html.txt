TITLE: The ASL_Window Tag

The ASL_Window Tag ]" border=0> An application that uses a custom screen normally wants its requesters to open on its screen. Using the ASL_Window tag, a program can associate a requester with a window so the requester appears on the window's screen. The ASL_Window tag is followed by a pointer to a window structure. ASL_Window works with both file and font requesters. Normally, a requester associated with a window (using ASL_Window) uses the window's IDCMP port for its communication. An application may not want to share an IDCMP port with the requester. Using the ASL_FuncFlags tag, a program can ask for a requester that creates its own IDCMP port. There are two flags that accomplish this. The first, FILF_NEWIDCMP, is used on file requesters. The other, FONF_NEWIDCMP, is used on font requesters. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
