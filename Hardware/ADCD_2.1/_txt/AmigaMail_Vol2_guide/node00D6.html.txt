Rasterizing a Glyph ]" border=0> Once an application has set up the scaling engine, obtaining a glyph is a matter of asking for it. As was mentioned earlier, the ObtainInfoA()/ObtainInfo() function queries a scaling engine for glyph information. This function accepts a pointer to a GlyphEngine structure and a tag list. To ask for a rasterization of a glyph, pass ObtainInfo() the OT_GlyphMap tag. The engine expects the OT_GlyphMap value to be an address where it can place the address of a GlyphMap structure. The GlyphMap structure (defined in ) is for reading only and looks like this: struct GlyphMap { UWORD glm_BMModulo; /* # of bytes in row: always multiple of 4 */ UWORD glm_BMRows; /* # of rows in bitmap */ UWORD glm_BlackLeft; /* # of blank pixel columns at left of */ /* glyph */ UWORD glm_BlackTop; /* # of blank rows at top of glyph */ UWORD glm_BlackWidth; /* span of non-blank columns (horizontal */ /* span of the glyph) */ UWORD glm_BlackHeight; /* span of non-blank rows (vertical span of */ /* the glyph) */ FIXED glm_XOrigin; /* distance from upper left corner of */ /* bitmap to lower */ FIXED glm_YOrigin; /* left of glyph (baseline), in fractional */ /* pixels */ WORD glm_X0; /* approximation of XOrigin in whole pixels */ WORD glm_Y0; /* approximation of YOrigin in whole pixels */ WORD glm_X1; /* approximation of XOrigin + Width */ WORD glm_Y1; /* approximation of YOrigin + Width */ FIXED glm_Width; /* character advance, as fraction of em */ /* width */ UBYTE *glm_BitMap; /* actual glyph bitmap */ }; The glm_BitMap field points to a single bitplane bitmap of the glyph. This bitmap is not necessarily in Chip RAM, so if an application needs to use the blitter to render the glyph, it has to copy the bitmap to a Chip RAM buffer. The fields glm_BMModulo and glm_BMRows are the dimensions of the whole bitmap. The glyph itself does not occupy the entire bitmap area. The fields glm_BlackLeft, glm_BlackTop, glm_BlackWidth, and glm_BlackHeight describe the position and dimension of the glyph within the bitmap. The fields glm_XOrigin and glm_YOrigin are the X and Y offsets from the bitmap's upper left corner to the glyph's lower left corner. The lower left corner lies on the glyph's baseline. These X and Y offsets are in fractional pixels. The fields glm_X0 and glm_Y0 are rounded versions of glm_XOrigin and glm_YOrigin, respectively. The glm_Width field is a measure of the width of the glyph in fractions of an em (pronounced like the letter 'M'). This value is a fixed point binary fraction. The em is a relative measurement. A distance of one em is equal to the point size of the typeface. For example, in a 36 point typeface, one em equals 36 points which is approximately equal to a half inch. For a 72 point typeface, one em equals 72 points which is approximately equal to one inch. When an application is finished with the GlyphMap structure, it must use the ReleaseInfoA() or ReleaseInfo() function to relinquish the GlyphMap structure. This function uses the same format as ObtainInfoA()/ObtainInfo(), except the data value of the OT_GlyphMap tag is a pointer to the GlyphMap structure (rather than a pointer to a pointer).
