TITLE: A Directory Requester

A Directory Requester ]" border=0> A program may not need to process files in a requester, only the directories. There is another variation on asl.library's file requester that allows this. A new tag, ASL_ExtFlags1, toggles this option. ASL_ExtFlags1 passes a bit field like ASL_FuncFlags. One of ASL_ExtFlags1's flags, FIL1F_NOFILES, sets up a requester that has no string gadget for files and displays only directory names in the requester's scrolling list. When AslRequest() (or AslRequestTags() ) returns successfully, the FileRequester structure's rf__Dir field contains the name of the directory the user selected. Currently, there is another flag defined for ASL_ExtFlags1, FIL1F_MATCHDIRS. If file pattern matching is on (see the FILF_PATGAD flag for ASL_FuncFlags), setting FIL1F_MATCHDIRS tells the file requester to pattern match directory names as well as file names. Of course, if both of ASL_ExtFlags1's flags are set, the requester will only pattern match directory names. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
