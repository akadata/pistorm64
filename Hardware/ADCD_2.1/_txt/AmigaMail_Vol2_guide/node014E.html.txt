REW, PLAY, PAUSE, FF, STOP ]" border=0> These keys are mapped by the A570 ROM to the F1 through F5 keys on the Amiga keyboard. The Audio Control Panel uses these equivalents to play CD audio discs. If a title detects a keypress on F1 through F5, it should react as if the user had pressed the corresponding remote control button. Certain titles ported from the Amiga to the CDTV may have already established alternate uses of the F1 through F5 keys on the keyboard. Any such application that retains its mapping of the F1 through F5 keys for its A570 version should clearly document these alternate key mappings in its manual. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
