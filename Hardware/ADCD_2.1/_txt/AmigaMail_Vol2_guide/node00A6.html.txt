TITLE: OM_GET

OM_GET ]" border=0> Retrieve an object's attribute. This method receives the following parameters: struct opGet { ULONG MethodID; ULONG opg_AttrID; ULONG *opg_Storage; }; If the new class recognizes the attribute, the new class should fill in opg_Storage's target with the attribute's value. If the attribute is actually the attribute of some component object, you might want to pass the message on and let the component object process the OM_GET. If completely unrecognized, you should pass the message to your superclass. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
