TITLE: Step 1

Step 1 ]" border=0> All system supported fonts on the Amiga have a font contents file. From this file, an application can determine a font's type, so the application knows how to utilize the font. The font contents file is a FontContentsHeader structure (defined in ). The first field of that structure (fch_FileID) contains an ID identifying the font's type. If that type is OTAG_ID (0x0F03), the font is an outline and it should have a corresponding otag file. The otag file should be in the same directory as the font contents file.
