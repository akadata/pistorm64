TITLE: CxObjects

CxObjects ]" border=0> CxObjects are the basic building blocks used to construct a commodity. A commodity uses CxObjects to take care of all manipulations of CxMessages. When a CxMessage "arrives" at a CxObject, that CxObject carries out its primitive action and then, if it has not deleted the CxMessage, it passes the CxMessage on to the next CxObject. A commodity links together CxObjects into a tree, organizing these simple action objects to perform some higher function. A CxObject is in one of two states, active or inactive. An active CxObject performs its primitive action every time it receives a CxMessage. If a CxObject is inactive, CxMessages bypass it, continuing to the CxObject that follows the inactive one. By d efault, all CxObjects except the type called brokers are created in the active state. Figure 1: The Commodities Network [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
