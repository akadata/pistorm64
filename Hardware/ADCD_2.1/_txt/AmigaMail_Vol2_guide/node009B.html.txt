TITLE: Imageclass Subclasses

Imageclass Subclasses ]" border=0> An imageclass object contains an Image structure that Intuition uses to render objects such as gadgets. Boopsi imageclass objects are organized so that when NewObject() returns a pointer to an imageclass object, it points to the actual Image structure. Normally, an application does not create an imageclass object. Instead, it will use a subclass of imageclass. Currently, there are four subclasses: frameiclass, sysiclass, fillrectclass, and itexticlass. frameiclass - An embossed or recessed rectangular frame, rendered in the proper DrawInfo pens, with enough intelligence to bound or center its contents. sysiclass - The class of system images. The class includes all the images for the system gadgets, and the Gadtools check mark and button glyphs. fillrectclass - Rectangle with frame and pattern support. itexticlass - A specialized image class used for rendering text. Note that you have to calculate itexticlass object's width and height yourself. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
