TITLE: Attributes

Attributes ]" border=0> All boopsi objects have attributes associated with them. These attributes reflect various properties of a specific object. For example, an image object has attributes such as IA_Left, IA_Top, IA_Width, and IA_Height, all of which correspond to fields in the Image structure. Five methods deal with an object's attributes: OM_NEW sets attributes at object creation (initialization) time OM_SET changes attributes after the object has been created OM_GET reads an object attribute OM_UPDATE updates an object attribute (for use by objects only) OM_NOTIFY notifies one object of changes to another object's attributes Not all of these methods apply to all attributes. Some attributes are not "settable" or not "gettable", for example. See the appendix at the end of this article to find out which of these methods apply to specific attributes.
