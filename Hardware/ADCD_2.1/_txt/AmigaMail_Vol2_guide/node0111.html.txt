TITLE: The ShowNote Server Application

The ShowNote Server Application ]" border=0> Although the Amiga's Shared Socket Library is meant to be compatible with the Unix socket implementation, there are a couple of Amiga-specific quirks that an Amiga networked application has to take care of. First, an Amiga application has to open the Shared Socket Library (socket.library). Before calling any other functions in socket.library, the program has to call the socket.library function, setup_sockets(). ShowNote.c code has almost all of the network intialization material in the SS_Init() function. /* ** Attempt to open socket library and initialize socket environment. ** If this fails, bail out to the non-returning AppPanic() routine. */ if (SockBase = OpenLibrary("inet:libs/socket.library",0L)) { setup_sockets( 3, &errno ); } else { AppPanic("Can't open socket.library!",0); } Unlike most libraries, socket.library does not go in LIBS:. Instead, it goes with the network-specific support files, in INET:, in a LIBS directory. This location needs to be hardcoded into the application. Next, create a socket: /* ** Open the initial socket on which incoming messages will queue for ** handling. While the server is iterative, I do it this way so that ** SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C will continue to function. */ int snum; if ((snum = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )) == -1) { AppPanic("Socket Creation:",errno); } and figure out what the well-known port number of the server is. For testing purposes, SendNote and ShowNote use a hard-coded port number (8769). If the application was installed on a network, each machine that ran the server would need an entry for the "note" service in the inet:db/services file. In that case, both the server and the client would have to use getservbyname() to find the port number of the "note" service. The server then needs to build a sockaddr_in structure describing itself. The sockaddr_in contains all the information needed to map an initialized socket to a specific transport address on the Internet (thus the _in suffix, other network protocols have different suffixes). Before the socket can be assigned an Internet transport address, it needs to be initialized: struct sockaddr_in sockaddr; memset( &sockaddr, 0, len ); /* clear sockaddr */ sockaddr.sin_family = AF_INET; sockaddr.sin_port = 8769; sockaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; Next, bind the socket to the well-known address in sockaddr. if ( bind( snum, (struct sockaddr *)&sockaddr, len ) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
