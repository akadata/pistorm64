sana2.device/S2_DELMULTICASTADDRESS ]" border=0> NAME DelMultiCastAddress -- Disable an interface multicast address. FUNCTION This command causes device driver to disable multicast packet reception for the requested address. It is an error to disable a multicast address that is not enabled. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - S2_DELMULTICASTADDRESS ios2_SrcAddr - Multicast address to disable. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. NOTES Multicast addresses are added globally -- anyone using the device may receive packets as a result of any multicast address which has been added for the device. Since multicast addresses are not "bound" to a particular packet type, each enabled multicast address has an "enabled" count associated with it so that if two protocols add the same multicast address and later one removes it, it is still enabled until the second removes it.
