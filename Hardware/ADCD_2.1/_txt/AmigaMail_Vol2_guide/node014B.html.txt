TITLE: 0-9 Buttons

0-9 Buttons ]" border=0> The 0-9 and ENTER buttons located in the center of the remote are replaced by the Amiga keyboard's numeric keypad. The keycodes of the remote represent those found on the keypad, the only difference being the reversed physical layout of the keys: Remote Numeric keypad 1 2 3 7 8 9 4 5 6 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 0 Your code will probably not have to be modified to take this into account, unless it displays 9 icons in a grid pattern, and wants the user to type in a number corresponding to a certain position. If you support a jumping highlight (as suggested in the CDTV User Interface Guidelines), this should not be a problem. Your code should also support the 10 numeric keys on top of the alphanumeric keyboard (just below the function keys) for input of numbers. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
