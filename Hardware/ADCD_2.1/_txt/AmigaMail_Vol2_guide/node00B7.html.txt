TITLE: AppMenuItems

AppMenuItems ]" border=0> Using the workbench.library's AddAppMenuItem() call, an application can add an AppMenuItem to the Workbench's "Tools" menu. This AppAdd function has one parameter unique to it, menutext (from the prototype above). It points to the string that appears in the "Tools" menu. An AppMenuItem performs the same functions as an AppIcon or AppWindow, but it does not require the overhead of a DiskObject or a window. It also does not require the user to drop icons on an object. In some cases, the user might prefer to use an AppMenuItem over an AppIcon or AppWindow because the user doesn't have to shuffle around the Workbench windows to get to the "Tools" menu. Note that in older versions of release 2.0, Workbench did not supply a list of WBArgs when the user selected an AppMenuItem. The C source code example AppMenu.c at the end of this article is a simple example of how to create an AppMenuItem. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
