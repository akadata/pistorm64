TITLE: JOY/MOUSE

JOY/MOUSE ]" border=0> This button on the remote determines whether the remote's cursor buttons respond as a joystick or as a mouse. This is not necessary on the Amiga + A570: to enter joystick mode, the user simply plugs a joystick into the Amiga. To enter mouse mode, he uses his mouse. Some CDTV applications only support one mode or the other. Titles should support both modes, if possible. If a title only supports joystick mode and the title cannot be reasonably controlled from the keyboard, you should indicate this on your packaging, as an Amiga + A570 user might not have a joystick.
