TITLE: The Application Protocol

The Application Protocol ]" border=0> The note program now needs an application protocol for sending information between the client and server. When the client sends a request message to the server, it needs to send the note string. It also would be nice to supply the text for the buttons that will pop up in the requester. On the return trip from ShowNote to the SendNote client, the protocol only needs to define some return codes so the client can tell if the request worked and which button on the requester the remote user clicked. Because the application needs to send different types of packets (one type containing a message request, the other type containing the response from the server), the protocol needs to have a way to specify a packet type. The following structure is the packet that ShowNote and SendNote send back and forth to each other: struct NetNote { int nn_Code; int nn_Retval; char nn_Text[200], nn_Button[40]; }; On the trip from client to server, the nn_Code field is the message request packet type (NN_MSG), nn_Text is the note for the remote user, and nn_button is the text for the EasyRequest buttons. On the return trip, nn_Code is either NN_ACK, if there was no error, or NN_ERR, if there was an error. If there was no error, nn_Retval contains the number of the EasyRequest button that the user selected. In this application, the same packet is passed back and forth for both legs of the trip (client to server and vice versa). If the application required sending large chunks of data in one direction and small chunks of data in the other direction, it would be a good idea to use packets of different sizes. Otherwise, if the application used only one packet size, the size of the packet would be huge compared to the size of the small chunk of data, which would unnecessarily loading the network.
