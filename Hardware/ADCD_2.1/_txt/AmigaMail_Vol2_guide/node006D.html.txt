TITLE: II-49: Directory Scanning

II-49: Directory Scanning ]" border=0> by Ewout Walraven Prior to release 2.0, examining the contents of directories using dos.library required the use of two functions: Examine() and ExNext(). Although these routines perform the task for which they were intended, they have limitations. One is that these functions require stepping through a directory one entry at a time. For most applications that need to do directory scanning, it would more efficient to scan a directory in one pass rather than many. This would significantly reduce the time spent scanning. Also, these functions don't know anything about the AmigaDOS wildcards, so any wildcard processing must be done by the application, not by the OS.
