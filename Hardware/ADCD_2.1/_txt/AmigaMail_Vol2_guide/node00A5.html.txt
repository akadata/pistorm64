TITLE: OM_SET

OM_SET ]" border=0> This method is used to set an object's attributes. The Intuition function SetAttr() calls this method. It receives the following arguments: struct opSet { ULONG MethodID; struct TagItem *ops_AttrList; struct GadgetInfo *ops_GInfo; }; For the OM_SET method, the new class's dispatcher should process the attributes your class recognizes and have the superclass process any unrecognized attributes. Note that a subclass dispatcher can directly process attributes it inherits from a superclass, rather than passing the message on to the superclass. Note that mytextlabelclass treats the OM_UPDATE method exactly like the OM_SET method. This is OK because these two methods are functionally equivalent for imageclass classes.
