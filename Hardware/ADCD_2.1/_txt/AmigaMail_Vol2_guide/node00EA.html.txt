TITLE: AROW (0x41524F57) / An arrow-head pattern /

AROW (0x41524F57) / An arrow-head pattern / ]" border=0> The AROW chunk describes an arrowhead pattern. DR2D open polygons (OPLY) can have arrowheads attached to their endpoints. See the description of the OPLY chunk later in this article for more information on the OPLY chunk. #define ARROW_FIRST 0x01 /* Draw an arrow on the OPLY's first point */ #define ARROW_LAST 0x02 /* Draw an arrow on the OPLY's last point */ struct AROWstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; UBYTE Flags; /* Flags, from ARROW_*, above */ UBYTE Pad0; /* Should always 0 */ USHORT ArrowID; /* Name of the arrow head */ USHORT NumPoints; IEEE ArrowPoints[NumPoints*2]; }; The Flags field specifies which end(s) of an OPLY to place an arrowhead based on the #defines above. ArrowID is the number by which an OPLY will reference this arrowhead pattern. The coordinates in the array ArrowPoints[] define the arrowhead's shape. These points form a closed polygon. See the section on the OPLY/CPLY object chunks for a descriptionof how DR2D defines shapes. The arrowhead is drawn in the same coordinate system relative to the endpoint of the OPLY the arrowhead is attached to. The arrowhead's origin (0,0) coincides with the OPLY's endpoint. DR2D assumes that the arrowhead represented in the AROW chunk is pointing to the right so the proper rotation can be applied to the arrowhead. The arrow is filled according to the current fill pattern set in the ATTR object attribute chunk. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
