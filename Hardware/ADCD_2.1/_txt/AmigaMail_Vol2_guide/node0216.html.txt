SYNOPSIS success = CopyFromBuff(to, from, n) d0 a0 a1 d0 BOOL CopyToBuff(VOID *, VOID *, ULONG); FUNCTION This function copies 'n' bytes of data in the abstract data structure pointed to by 'from' into the contigous memory pointed to by 'to'. 'to' must contain at least 'n' bytes of usable memory or innocent memory will be overwritten. INPUTS to - pointer to contiguous memory to copy to. from - pointer to abstract structure to copy from. n - number of bytes to copy. RESULT success - TRUE if operation was successful, else FALSE. EXAMPLE NOTES This function must be callable from interupts. In particular, this means that this function may not directly or indirectly call any system memory functions (since those functions rely on Forbid() to protect themselves) and that you must not compile this function with stack checking enabled. See the RKM:Libraries Exec:Interupts chapter for more details on what is legal in a routine called from an interupt handler. 'C' programmers should not compile with stack checking (option '-v' in SAS) and should geta4() or __saveds. BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
