VIII-51: SANA-II Network Device Driver Specification ]" border=0> Amiga Networking Group - Brian Jackson, Dale Larson Greg Miller, Kenneth Dyke The SANA-II Network Device Driver Specification is a standard for an Amiga software interface between networking hardware and network protocol stacks (or for software tools such as network monitors). A network protocol stack is a layer of software that network applications use to address particular processes on remote machines and to send data reliably in spite of hardware errors. There are several common network protocol stacks including TCP/IP, OSI, AppleTalk, DECNet and Novell. SANA-II device drivers are intended to allow multiple network protocol stacks running on the same machine to share one network device. For example, the TCP/IP and AppleTalk protocol stacks could both run on the same machine over one ethernet board. The device drivers are also intended to allow network protocol stacks to be written in a hardware-independent fashion so that a different version of each protocol stack doesn't have to be written for each networking hardware device. The standard does not address the writing of network applications. Application writers must not use SANA-II Device Drivers directly. Network applications must use the API provided by the network protocol software the application supports. There is not an Amiga standard network API at the time of this writing, though there is the AS225 TCP/IP package and its socket.library as well as other (third-party) packages. To write a SANA-II device driver, you will need to be familiar with the specification documents for the hardware you are writing to and with the SANA-II Network Device Driver Specification. To write a network protocol stack which will use SANA-II device drivers, you should have general familiarity with common network hardware and must be very familiar with the SANA-II Network Device Driver Specification as well as the specification for the protocol you are developing. If you are creating a new protocol, you must obtain a protocol type number for any hardware on which your protocol will be used. Commodore supports the SANA-II specification by providing drivers for the Commodore-Amiga network hardware. We have an A2065.device (Ethernet) and intend to produce an A2060.device (ARCNET). We also try to examine review copies of third-party SANA-II networking hardware and software to try to make sure that they interoperate with our products. This standard has undergone several drafts with long periods for comment from developers and the Amiga community at large. These drafts include a UseNet release which was also distributed on the Fish Disks in June, 1991 (as well as published in the '91 DevCon notes), and the November 7 Draft for Final Comment and Approval distributed via Bix, ADSP and UseNet. There were also several intermediate drafts with more limited distribution. This version of the specification is final. Any new version of the standard (i.e., to add new features) is planned to be backward compatible. No SANA-II device driver or software utilizing those drivers should be written to any earlier version of the specification. Distribution of this version of the standard is unlimited. Anyone may write Amiga software which implements a SANA-II network device driver or which calls a SANA-II network device driver without restriction and may freely distribute such software that they have written.

It is important to try to test each SANA-II device driver against all software which uses SANA-II devices. Available example programs are valuable in initial testing. The Amiga Networking Group is interested in receiving evaluation and/or beta test copies of all Amiga networking hardware, SANA-II device drivers and software which uses SANA-II devices. However, we make no assurances regarding any testing which we may or may not perform with such evaluation copies.
