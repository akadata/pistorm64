TITLE: I-7: The ASL Library

I-7: The ASL Library ]" border=0> by John Orr The asl.library library provides the release 2.0 Amiga OS with system standard file and font requesters. Any application that needs to use a file or font requester should use asl.library requesters because they are easy to implement, they are easy for the user to learn, and because they are the same from one application to the next, they make applications more user friendly. This article requires a general understanding of several Amiga concepts: TagItems and TagLists (see the Utility library Autodocs), Intuition screens and windows, some of the graphics.library's font structures, and AmigaDOS pattern matching.
