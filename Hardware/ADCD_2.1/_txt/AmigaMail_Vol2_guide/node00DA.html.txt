Shearing ]" border=0> Like baseline rotation, glyph shearing (also known as italicizing) is a matter of setting some Level 0 tags. The shearing tags, OT_ShearSin and OT_ShearCos, specify the shearing angle, or the angle at which the typeface is italicized. This angle refers to the angle that results from rotating the vertical axis clockwise. The angle can range from -45 to 45 degrees (inclusive). Like the rotation angle, the shearing angle is represented as a sine and cosine value that must correspond to the same angle and must fall into normal bounds for sine and cosine values. Also like the rotation angle sine and cosine tags, an application must set both the OT_ShearSin and OT_ShearCos tags, in that order. By default, the shearing value is zero degrees meaning there is no shearing (OT_ShearSin = 0x00000000, OT_ShearCos = 0x00010000). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
