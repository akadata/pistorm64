TITLE: The SendNote Client Application

The SendNote Client Application ]" border=0> The client application, SendNote, sends a message for a server to pop up on its display. While the server is an Intuition program in that it uses a requester to display the messages and get responses, the client (SendNote) is strictly a CLI-based application. SendNote parses its command line using the AmigaDOS 2.0 ReadArgs() call. For more information on ReadArgs(), see the AmigaDOS Manual, 3rd Edition from Bantam, the article " Standard Command Line Parsing " from the May/June 1991 issue of Amiga Mail, or the DOS library includes and Autodocs. There is very little difference in the application-wide setup of sockets between the client and server. Both must open socket.library and call setup_sockets() to initialize the socket environment. One minor difference is the number of sockets the client initializes. The client only needs a single socket to establish a connection to the server, where the server requires at least two (one for receiving connection requests and one for talking to a client). The FinalExit() routine is both the client's error handler and its shutdown routine. Since the client doesn't need to maintain so much operating information, the shutdown routine is rather simple, and can be used for both errors and normal termination.
