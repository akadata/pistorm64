TITLE: Opening a Simple File Requester

Opening a Simple File Requester ]" border=0> Using an ASL requester requires the use of three functions: myrequester = APTR AllocAslRequest( ULONG type, struct TagItem *tagList ); void FreeAslRequest( APTR request ); made_selection = BOOL AslRequest( APTR request, struct TagItem *tagList ); An ASL requester is based on a FileRequester or a FontRequester structure. Programs must allocate this structure with AllocAslRequest() (or AllocFileRequest()see the asl.library Autodoc for more on this function). Currently, the type field (from the above prototype) can be one of two values (as defined in ), ASL_FileRequest, to ask for a FileRequester structure, or ASL_FontRequest, to ask for a FontRequester structure. The values in this structure are for read access only. Any changes to them are carried out through asl.library function calls. The FreeAslRequest() function deallocates an ASL requester structure. struct FileRequester { /* (from ) */ APTR rf_Reserved1; BYTE *rf_File; /* Filename pointer */ BYTE *rf_Dir; /* Directory name pointer */ CPTR rf_Reserved2; UBYTE rf_Reserved3; UBYTE rf_Reserved4; APTR rf_Reserved5; WORD rf_LeftEdge,rf_TopEdge; /* Preferred window pos */ WORD rf_Width,rf_Height; /* Preferred window size */ WORD rf_Reserved6; LONG rf_NumArgs; /* A-la WB Args, for multiselects */ struct WBArg *rf_ArgList; APTR rf_UserData; /* Applihandle (you may write!!) */ APTR rf_Reserved7; APTR rf_Reserved8; BYTE *rf_Pat; /* Pattern match pointer */ }; /* note - more reserved fields follow */ Based on the requester structure passed to it, AslRequest() brings up a font or file requester. When the user makes a selection, AslRequest returns a value. If it returns anything but FALSE (0), the user selected a file (or a font). AslRequest() returns FALSE if the user cancels the requester or the requester failed for some reason. Both AslRequest() and AllocAslRequest() accept a tag list. This tag list is used to set the values in the FileRequester (or FontRequester) structure. The C code example SimpleFR.c at the end of this article uses the following tags (all the ASL tags are defined in ): ASL_Hail ASL_Width ASL_Height ASL_LeftEdge ASL_TopEdge ASL_OKText ASL_CancelText ASL_File ASL_Dir ASL_Hail supplies a requester with a string to placed in the title bar of the requester window. ASL_Width, _Height, _LeftEdge, and _TopEdge describe the initial dimensions and position of the requester window. ASL_OKText and ASL_CancelText provide alternate strings for the ``OK'' and ``Cancel'' gadgets. Currently, the size of these gadgets limits the length of the names to about six characters. The two remaining tags from the above list, ASL_File and ASL_Dir, tags are specific to file requesters. They supply the initial file and directory names for the file requester. For a file requester, if AslRequest() returns anything but FALSE, SimpleFR.c looks at the FileRequester's rf_File and rf_Dir fields to get the name and directory of the file the user selected. Note that the requester allows the user to type in a name for the file and directory, which makes it possible for a file requester to return a file and directory that do not (currently) exist. In the case of a save requester (discussed a little later), the requester can create that non-existent directory. Figure 1 - The SimpleFR.c file requester The simpleFR.c example (and the rest of the ASL examples for that matter) may be a little misleading because it only uses the requester once. Any application that needs a requester should allocate the requester only once and pop up that requester every time the application needs one. If instead, the application allocated, used, and deallocated a requester each time it needed one, all of the settings the user left in the requester (like the names the user last typed into the drawer or file string gadgets) would be reset to their initial values. By reusing a requester, the values stored in it are preserved. Although retaining previous requester values from one request to another preserves user preferences, it also preserves other values stored in the requester structure. The file and font requester structures contain many private fields that toggle various features of the ASL requesters (those features are set via tags). If a program sets up a file requester with a specific feature, after the requester returns, the file requester structure is still set up with the specific feature. The next time the application wants to use that file requester without that specific feature, it must explicitly turn that feature off in the subsequent AslRequest() call.
