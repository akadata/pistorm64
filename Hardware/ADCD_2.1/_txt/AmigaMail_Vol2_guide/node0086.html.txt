If dirty data cache lines are present, push them to memory first. Caches must be cleared after *any* operation that could cause invalid or stale data. The most common cases are DMA and modifying instructions using the processor. See the CacheClearE() autodoc for a more complete description. Some examples of when the cache needs clearing: Self modifying code Building Jump tables Run-time code patches Relocating code for use at different addresses.
