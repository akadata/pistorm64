TITLE: The System() Function

The System() Function ]" border=0> The System() function is intended to replace the Execute() function of release 1.3. System() spawns a shell process to execute the command line which is passed to System() as an argument. The shell parses the command-line normally, just like command-lines typed directly into the shell's console. If it can, System() will pass the current path and directory to the programs it launches. The System() function can execute external commands either synchronously or asynchronously. When System() is used synchronously, control returns to the calling program after the external program has completed. In this case, System() returns the external program's return code, or a -1 if the command could not be found or run. On the other hand, when System() initiates a program asynchronously, the program is no longer a concern for the caller. The operating system will take care of the cleanup. This is extremely useful for an application that must start up multiple programs on user demand, such as a hot key commodity. By default, System() starts programs synchronously. To launch a program asynchronously, use the SYS_Asynch tag with the data field set to TRUE. With the System() call, it is easy to provide programs with specific input and output handles. The tags SYS_Input and SYS_Output (defined in dos/dostags.h) are used to supply the input and output file handles. A program can pass its own input and output handles to a synchronously launched program by passing the results of Input() and Output(), respectively. Note that with a synchronous System() call, the OS will not close these handles when the spawned process exits. In the case of an asynchronously launched program, the launching program normally must provide new IO handles since the system automatically closes these handles when the asynchronous process ends. Because AmigaDOS wants separate handles for input and output, System() will automatically create an output handle if it's passed a handle for SYS_Input and NULL for SYS_Output. This allows a program to open a CON: window for input and use it for both input and output, as System() will test to see if input is interactive and, if so, will attempt to open ``*'' for output to that console. If the input file handle is not interactive, System() opens ``*'' on the current console task. Programs launched using System() are not restricted to the built-in, or Boot, shell. In the near future, System() will be able to take advantage of specially designed shells (the design requirements of these special shells have not yet been documented). Two tags, SYS_UserShell and SYS_CustomShell, specify which shell System() should use to execute the command-line. By using the SYS_UserShell tag with a tag value of TRUE, an application tells System() to send a command to the user's preferred shell rather that the boot shell (Note that the default user shell is the boot shell). If an application opens a shell for the user or executes the user's command-lines, it should tell System() to use the user shell. If an application requires consistent shell behavior, it must not use the user shell because the user can change the user shell. Another shell tag, SYS_CustomShell, allows an application to choose other shells besides the boot and user shells. This tag's data field should contain the custom shell's name as it appears in the system resident list. Although it does offer many features, System() does have some limitations. First, because command paths currently only exist in the CLI structure, Workbench (non-CLI) processes have no paths. Consequently, when a Workbench process calls a program using System(), the shell has no path to search for that program (aside from the system default search path of C: and the current directory). A second limitation of the System() function involves CTRL-C/D/E/F handling. When a task opens a CON: window to provide a handle for a System()-launched command, that task is the owner of the handle. This has two effects. A System()-launched command running in that CON: window will only be able to receive CTRL-C/D/E/F signals while it is doing input or output to the window (i.e. when it has a pending read or write). If the task that owns the handle is still around, it receives CTRL-C/D/E/F signals whenever those keys are pressed in the CON: window. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
