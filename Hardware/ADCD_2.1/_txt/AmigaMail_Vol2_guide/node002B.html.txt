TITLE: Workbench

Workbench ]" border=0> * The Workbench GUI now has new screen sizes, screen top/left offsets, depths, modes, and fonts. * Default Tool now searches paths. * New Look (boxed) icons take more space. * Do not use icons which have more 1bits set in PlanePick than planes in the ImageData (one IFF-to-Icon utility does this). Such icons will appear trashed on deeper Workbenches. * New Look colors have black and white swapped (as compared to 1.3). * The Workbench screen may not be open at startup-sequence time until some output occurs to the initial Shell window. This can break startup-sequence-started games that think they can steal WB's screen bitplanes. Do not steal the WB screen's planes (For compatibility, booting off pre-2.0 disks forces the initial screen open. This is not guaranteed to remain in the system). Use startup code that can detach when RUN (such as cback.o) and use CloseWorkbench() to regain the screen's memory. Under 1.3 the Workbench Screen and initial CLI opened before the first line in s:startup-sequence. Some naughty programmers, in an attempt to recover memory, would search for the bitplane pointers and appropriate the memory for their own use. This behavior is highly unsafe. By default 2.0 opens the initial CLI on the first _output_ from the s:startup-sequence. This allows screen modes and other parameters to be set before the user sees the screen. However, this broke so many programs that we put in the ``silent-startup'' hack. A disk installed with 1.3 install opens the screen as before. A disk installed under 2.0 opens silently. Never steal the Workbench bitplanes. You don't know where they are, how big they are, what format they may be in, or even if they are allocated. Recovering the memory is a bit tricky. Under 2.0: Simply avoid any output from your s:startup-sequence. If your program opens a screen it will be the first screen the user ever sees. Note that if ENDCLI is ever hit, the screen will pop open. Under 1.3: After ENDCLI, call the CloseWorkbench() function to close the screen. This also works under 2.0. Loop on CloseWorkbench() with a delay between loops. Continue looping until CloseWorkbench() succeeds or too much time has passed. Note that a new program called EndRun is available for starting non-returning programs from the startup-sequence. EndRun will reduce memory fragmentation and will close Workbench if it is open. EndRun.lzh will be available in Commodore's Amiga listings area on BIX. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
