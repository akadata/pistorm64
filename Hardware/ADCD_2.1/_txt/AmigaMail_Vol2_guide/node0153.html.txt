TITLE: Fonts

Fonts ]" border=0> For CDTV usage, a typical font should be no less than 18 points high. This permits the user to easily view text from a distance. An A570 user might prefer a smaller font in order to have more text on the screen, especially when using text-based applications. In this case, an application should offer a selection of at least 2 different-sized fonts to the user. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
