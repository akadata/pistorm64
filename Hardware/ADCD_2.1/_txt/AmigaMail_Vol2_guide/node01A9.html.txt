TITLE: propgclass

propgclass ]" border=0> Class: propgclass Superclass: gadgetclass Description: Extended function proportional gadgets. Include File: New Methods: ------------ None. Changed Methods: ---------------- All methods defined by gadgetclass are handled to provide compatible proportional gadget processing. OM_SET, OM_UPDATE - Changes attributes and, if needed and if propgclass is the true class, will update the slider visuals by updating the knob position and dimensions. GM_HANDLEINPUT - If the knob position changes sufficiently to change PGA_Top, this method will issue an OM_NOTIFY message, with attributes PGA_Top and GA_ID. The OPUF_INTERIM flag will be set for intermediate messages issued while the mouse is dragging the slider knob. This method Will issue a message with OPUF_INTERIM clear when it is done, which is the "final value". Attributes: ----------- GA_Image (I) GA_Border (I) If you don't pass GA_Image to NewObject(), the gadget will create and use an AUTOKNOB. Likewise if you pass (the "illegal" attribute) GA_Border: an AUTOKNOB will be used instead. GA_HighLight (I) GADGHBOX highlighting is not allowed, and will be converted to GADGHBOX. GA_SpecialInfo () This attributed is "forced" to point to the PropInfo allocated for objects of this class. Other gadgetclass attributes are passed along to the superclass. PGA_Freedom (IG) May be either of FREEHORIZ or FREEVERT (not both). The default is FREEVERT. PGA_Borderless (I) Means the same as PropInfo.Flags BORDERLESS. PGA_HorizPot, PGA_VertPot, PGA_HorizBody, PGA_VertBody These are defined in the include file but obsolete and will not be supported. Class propgclass supports gadgets that are vertical or horizontally free, but not both. PGA_Top (ISGNU) PGA_Visible (ISU) PGA_Total (ISU) These attributes are very useful replacements to Pot and Body variables. They are based on the use of proportional gadgets to control scrolling text. When scrolling 100 lines of text in a 25 line visible window, you would set PGA_Total to 100, PGA_Visible to 25, and watch PGA_Top run from 0 to 75 (the top line of the last page). All internal prop gadget values will be calculated based on these (depending on whether the gadget is FREEHORIZ or FREEVERT). "Container clicks" for page jumps will leave an overlap of one line, unless the value PGA_Visible is 1, in which case the prop gadget acts as an integer numeric slider taking values from 0 to PGA_Total - 1. Note that PGA_Top has OM_NOTIFY access. All three of these attributes have OM_UPDATE access, so they can be controlled via interconnections. PGA_NewLook (I) Equivalent to PropInfo.Flags PROPNEWLOOK flag. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
