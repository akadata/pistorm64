frameiclass ]" border=0> Class: frameiclass Superclass: imageclass Description: A raised, sunken, or chisled image class supporting frame dimensions and Intuition new look parameters. Include File: New Methods: ------------ None, but implements some of the no-ops in imageclass. Changed Methods: ---------------- OM_GET - A no-op for this class. IM_DRAW - Draws the embossed frame in its natural (Image) dimensions. Frame thickness support of IA_LineWidth is currently not implemented. Frame type is determined by attributes below, colors determined by DrawInfo and supports these drawing states: IDS_NORMAL, IDS_INACTIVENORMAL, IDS_DISABLED: Renders edges in shadowPen, shinePen, and backgroundPen for the interior. NOTE: No ghosting is done for IDS_DISABLED. IDS_SELECTED, IDS_INACTIVESELECTED: Renders edges in shadowPen, shinePen, and hifillPen, for the interior. IM_DRAWFRAME - Same as IM_DRAW, but draws frame to specified exterior dimensions. IM_FRAMEBOX - Centers contents, adds dimension for frame thickness, plus an interior margin of the same thickness. Attributes: ----------- IA_Recessed (IS) Specifies that the frame should be recessed into the drawing surface (shadowPen used on upper and left edges). Default is FALSE, a raised frame. IA_DoubleEmboss (IS) Two nested embossed frames for "chisled" boxes or "ridges". Not currently supported. IA_EdgesOnly (IS) Does not fill frame, just draws the edges. IA_LineWidth () Not currently supported. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
