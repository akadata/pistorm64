TITLE: BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh()

BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh() ]" border=0> To improve the performance of repairing damage to simple and smart refresh windows, Intuition can put a window into a special refresh state using Intuition's BeginRefresh() function: VOID BeginRefresh(struct Window *window) While a window is in this state, the system restricts attempts to render into the window to the window's damaged regions. Because the system ignores rendering operations outside the window's damage regions, an application only refreshes the parts of a window that need refreshing. This can significant decrease the amount of time necessary to refresh the window. This also reduces the possibility of visual flicker that can happen if an application has to redraw the entire contents of a window. To end a window's special refresh state, use EndRefresh(): VOID EndRefresh(struct Window *window, BOOL Complete) Compared to BeginRefresh(), EndRefresh() has an extra parameter, a boolean value. If this value is TRUE, Intuition assumes that all of the refreshing for this window is finished and removes all of the window layer's damaged regions. In most cases, this value should be TRUE. See the Autodoc for BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh() for more information. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
