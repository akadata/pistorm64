IM_ERASEFRAME ]" border=0> The IM_ERASEFRAME method instructs an image confined to a given rectangle to erase itself. Normally this method is used to erase an image drawn using the IM_DRAWFRAME method. This method expects the following parameters: struct impErase { ULONG MethodID; struct RastPort *imp_RPort; struct { WORD X; WORD Y; } imp_Offset; /* these parameters only valid for IM_ERASEFRAME */ struct { WORD Width; WORD Height; } imp_Dimensions; }; The mytextlabelclass example blindly passes this method on to its superclass. The superclass treats IM_ERASEFRAME just like IM_ERASE. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
