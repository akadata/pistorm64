sana2.device/CMD_WRITE ]" border=0> NAME Write -- Send packet to the network. FUNCTION This command causes the packet to be sent to the specified network interface. Normally, appropriate packet header and trailer information will be added to the packet data when it is sent. If bit SANA2IOB_RAW is set in io_Flags, then the ios2_Data is assumed to contain an entire physical frame and will be sent (copied to the wire via CopyFromBuffer() unmodified. Note that the device should not check to see if the destination address is on the local hardware. Network protocols should realize that the packet has a local destination long before it gets to a SANA-II driver. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - CMD_WRITE. ios2_Flags - Supported flags are: SANA2IOB_RAW SANA2IOB_QUICK ios2_PacketType - Packet type to send. ios2_DstAddr - Destination interface address for this packet. ios2_DataLength - Length of the Data to be sent. ios2_Data - Abstract data structure which packet data is contained in. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. NOTES The driver may not directly examine or modify anything pointed to by ios2_Data. It *must* use the requester-provided functions to access this data. SEE ALSO CMD_READ, S2_BROADCAST, S2_MULTICAST, any_protocol/CopyFromBuffer BUGS [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
