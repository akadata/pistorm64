TITLE: Filter CxObjects

Filter CxObjects ]" border=0> Because not all commodities are interested in every input event that makes it way down the input chain, Commodities Exchange has a method for filtering them. A filter CxObject compares the CxMessages it receives to a pattern. If a CxMessage matches the pattern, the filter diverts the CxMessage down its personal list of CxObjects. CxObj *CxFilter(char *descriptionstring); The C macro CxFilter() (defined in ) returns a pointer to a filter CxObject. The macro has only one argument, a pointer to a string describing which input events to filter. The following regular expression outlines the format of a description string (CX_POPKEY uses the same description string format): [class] ( [-] (qual | syn) )* [ [-] upstroke] [highmap |ANSICode] the * means zero or more occurances of ( [-] ( qual | syn ) ) where: class can be any one of the strings in the table below. Each string corresponds to a class of input event (shown below). The classes are defined in . Commodities Exchange will assume the class is rawkey if the class is not explici tly stated. "rawkey" IECLASS_RAWKEY "rawmouse" IECLASS_RAWMOUSE "event" IECLASS_EVENT "pointerpos" IECLASS_POINTERPOS "timer" IECLASS_TIMER "newprefs" IECLASS_NEWPREFS "diskremoved" IECLASS_DISKREMOVED "diskinserted" IECLASS_DISKINSERTED qual is one of the strings in the table below. Each string corresponds to an input event qualifier (followed by its ID from ). A dash preceding the qualifier string tells the filter object not to care if that qualifier is present i n the input event. Notice that there can be more than one qual (or none at all) in the input description string. "lshift" IEQUALIFIER_LSHIFT "rshift" IEQUALIFIER_RSHIFT "capslock" IEQUALIFIER_CAPSLOCK "control" IEQUALIFIER_CONTROL "lalt" IEQUALIFIER_LALT "ralt" IEQUALIFIER_RALT "lcommand" IEQUALIFIER_LCOMMAND "rcommand" IEQUALIFIER_RCOMMAND "numericpad" IEQUALIFIER_NUMERICPAD "repeat" IEQUALIFIER_REPEAT "midbutton" IEQUALIFIER_MIDBUTTON "rbutton" IEQUALIFIER_RBUTTON "leftbutton" IEQUALIFIER_LEFTBUTTON "relativemouse" IEQUALIFIER_RELATIVEMOUSE syn is one of the strings in the table below. These strings act as synonyms for groups of qualifiers. Each string below is followed by its identifier from . A dash preceding the synonym string tells the filter object not to car e if that qualifier is present in the input event. Notice that there can be more than one syn (or none at all) in the input description string. "shift" IXSYM_SHIFT /* look for either shift key */ "caps" IXSYM_CAPS /* look for either shift key or capslock */ "alt" IXSYM_ALT /* look for either alt key */ upstroke is the literal string "upstroke". If this string is absent, the filter considers only downstrokes. If is present alone, the filter considers only upstrokes. If preceded by a dash, the filter considers both upstrokes and downstrokes. highmap is one of the following strings: "space", "backspace", "tab", "enter", "return", "esc", "del", "up", "down", "right", "left", "f1", "f2", "f3", "f4", "f5", "f6", "f7", "f8", "f9", "f10", "help". ANSICode is a single character (for example `a`) that Commodities Exchange looks up in the system default keymap. The following are some example description strings: "rawkey lshift alt f2" Function key f2 with the left shift and either alt key pressed. "-shift -alt -control a" The key that produces an 'a' with or without any shift, alt, or control keys pressed. "rawmouse rbutton" A mouse move with the right mouse button down. "timer" A timer event. As of commodities.library version 37.3, ParseIX(), the function used to parse input description strings, does not parse certain classes correctly. Only the rawkey, diskremoved, and newprefs classes are properly parsed. For the moment, any commodity that needs to look for the other classes must directly use Commodities Exchange's internal format for input event descriptions, input expressions or IX, discussed later in this article. A filter has to be inserted into the Commodities network before it can process any CxMessages. AttachCxObj() adds a CxObject to the personal list of another commodity. The HotKey.c example uses this function to attach its filter to a broker. void AttachCxObj(CxObj *HeadObj, CxObj *co); This function uses the Exec function AddTail() to add the CxObject to the end of HeadObj's personal list. The position of a CxObject list determines which CxObject gets CxMessages first. Other functions exist to add CxObjects at different points in the list (see the commodities.doc Autodoc for details).
