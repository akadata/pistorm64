IM_HITTEST ]" border=0> IM_HITTEST returns true if a point is within the image. The Intuition function PointInImage() uses this method. IM_HITTEST requires the following parameters: struct impHitTest { ULONG MethodID; struct { WORD X; WORD Y; } imp_Point; }; The mytextlabelclass example blindly passes this method on to its superclass. The superclass, imageclass, will return TRUE if the point is within the old Image structure box. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
