CIA Timers ]" border=0> * System use of CIA timers has changed. Don't peek timers you think the system is using in a particular manner. * Don't depend on initial values of CIA registers. * Don't mess with CIABase. Use cia.resource. * If your code requires hardware level CIA timers, allocate the timers using cia.resource AddICRVector()! Very important! Operating system usage of the CIA timers has changed. The new 2.0 timer.device (``Jumpy the Magic Timer Device'') will try to jump to different CIA's so programs that properly allocate timers will have a better chance of getting what they want. If possible, be flexible and design your code to work with whatever timer you can successfully allocate. * OS usage of INT6 is increasing. Do not totally take over INT6, and do not terminate the server chain if an interrupt is not for you. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
