TITLE: Cleanup

Cleanup ]" border=0> If you're exiting, use fn to tell you what to close, etc. First check if fn contains valid flags ((fn & 0x80000000) != 0)). If it does not have valid flags, Flush() and Close() cli_StandardOutput (if non-NULL), and Close() cli_StandardInput (if non-NULL). If fn does contain valid flags, Flush(Output()), then check the other flags in fn. If (fn&2 == 0) (if the user didn't provide an input stream), Close() cli_StandardInput. If (fn&1 == 1) (if Run provided an output stream), Close() cli_StandardOutput (note, this is opposite the previous flag!) If (fn&8 == 0) (if this is not an asynchronous System() call), you still have to ReplyPkt() the initial packet. Before sending back the packet put cli_ReturnCode in the packet's result1 and cli_Result2 in the packet's result2 (i.e. return the result of the last program run if this was a synchronous System() or Execute() call). In cleanup, unlock pr_CurrentDir and set it to NULL, free up anything you allocated, and exit! The system will take care of your CommandLineInterface structure, and anything else it allocated.
