Directory/File Manipulation/Information ]" border=0> The directory/file actions permits an application to make queries about and modifications to handler objects. These packets perform functions such as creating subdirectories, resolving links, and filling in FileInfoBlock structures for specific files. ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT 8 Lock(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock on directory to which ARG2 is relative ARG2: BSTR Name (possibly with a path) of object to lock ARG3: LONG Mode: ACCESS_READ/SHARED_LOCK, ACCESS_WRITE/EXCLUSIVE_LOCK RES1: LOCK Lock on requested object or 0 to indicate failure RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = 0 The AmigaDOS function Lock() uses this action to create its locks. Given a name for the object, which may include a path, (ARG2) and a lock on a directory from which to look for the name (and path), ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT will locate the object within the file system and create a FileLock structure associated with the object. If the directory lock in ARG1 is NULL, the name is relative to the root of the file handler's volume (a.k.a. ``:''). The memory for the FileLock structure returned in RES1 is maintained by the handler and freed by an ACTION_FREE_LOCK. Although it's not a requirement, if an handler expects to support the pre-1.3 Format command, it must accept any illegal mode as ACCESS_READ. A handler can create an exclusive lock only if there are no other outstanding locks on the given object. Once created, an exclusive lock prevents any other locks from being created for that object. In general, a handler uses the FileLock->fl_Key field to uniquely identify an object. Note that some applications rely on this (although a handler is not required to implement this packet). The fl_Volume field of the returned FileLock structure should point to the DOS device list's volume entry for the volume on which the lock exists. In addition, there are several diagnostic programs that expect all locks for a volume to be chained together off the dl_LockList field in the volume entry. Note that relying on this chaining is not safe, and can cause serious problems including a system crash. No application should use it. ACTION_COPY_DIR 19 DupLock(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock to duplicate RES1: LOCK Duplicated Lock or 0 to indicate failure RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = 0 This action's name is misleading as it does not manipulate directories. Instead, it creates a copy of a shared lock. The copy is subsequently freed with an ACTION_FREE_LOCK. Note that it is valid to pass a NULL lock. Currently, the DupLock() call always returns 0 if passed a 0, although a handler is not required to return a 0. ACTION_FREE_LOCK 15 UnLock(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock to free RES1: BOOL TRUE This action frees the lock passed to it. The AmigaDOS function Unlock() uses this packet. If passed a NULL lock, the handler should return success. ACTION_EXAMINE_OBJECT 23 Examine(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock of object to examine ARG2: BPTR FileInfoBlock to fill in RES1: BOOL Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = DOSFALSE This action fills in the FileInfoBlock with information about the locked object. The Examine() function uses this packet. This packet is actually used for two different types of operations. It is called to obtain information about a given object while in other cases, it is called to prepare for a sequence of EXAMINE_NEXT operations in order to traverse a directory. This seemingly simple operation is not without its quirks. One in particular is the FileInfoBlock->fib_Comment field. This field used to be 116 bytes long, but was changed to 80 bytes in release 1.2. The extra 36 bytes lie in the fib_Reserved field. Another quirk of this packet is that both the fib_EntryType and the fib_DirEntryType fields must be set to the same value, as some programs look at one field while other programs look at the other. File systems should use the same values for fib_DirEntryType as the ROM file system and ram-handler do. These are as follows: ST_ROOT 1 ST_USERDIR 2 ST_SOFTLINK 3 NOTE: this Shows up as a directory unless checked for explicitly ST_LINKDIR 4 ST_FILE -3 ST_LINKFILE -4 Also note that for directories, handlers must use numbers greater than 0, since some programs test to see if fib_DirEntryType is greater than zero, ignoring the case where fib_DirEntryType equals 0. Handlers should avoid using 0 because it is not interpreted consistently. ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT 24 ExNext(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock on directory being examined ARG2: BPTR BPTR FileInfoBlock RES1: BOOL Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = DOSFALSE The ExNext() function uses this packet to obtain information on all the objects in a directory. ACTION_EXAMINE fills in a FileInfoBlock structure describing the first file or directory stored in the directory referred to in the lock in ARG1. ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT is used to find out about the rest of the files and directories stored in the ARG1 directory. ARG2 contains a pointer to a valid FileInfoBlock field that was filled in by either an ACTION_EXAMINE or a previous ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT call. It uses this structure to find the next entry in the directory. This packets writes over the old FileInfoBlock with information on the next file or directory in the ARG2 directory. ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT returns a failure code of ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES when there are no more files or directories left to be examined. Unfortunately, like ACTION_EXAMINE, this packet has its own peculiarities. Among the quirks that ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT must account for are: · The situation where an application calls ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT one or more times and then stops invoking it before encountering the end of the directory. · The situation where a FileInfoBlock passed to ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT is not the same as the one passed to ACTION_EXAMINE or even the previous EXAMINE_NEXT operation. Instead, it is a copy of the FileInfoBlock with only the fib_DiskKey and the first 30 bytes of the fib_FileName fields copied over. This is now considered to be illegal and will not work in the future. Any new code should not be written in this manner. · Because a handler can receive other packet types between ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT operations, the ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT function must handle any special cases that may result. · The LOCK passed to ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT is not always the same lock used in previous operations. It is however a lock on the same object. Because of these problems, ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT is probably the trickiest action to write in any handler. Failure to handle any of the above cases can be quite disastrous. ACTION_CREATE_DIR 22 CreateDir(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock to which ARG2 is relative ARG2: BSTR Name of new directory (relative to ARG1) RES1: LOCK Lock on new directory RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = DOSFALSE ACTION_DELETE_OBJECT 16 DeleteFile(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock to which ARG2 is relative ARG2: BSTR Name of object to delete (relative to ARG1) RES1: BOOL Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = DOSFALSE ACTION_RENAME_OBJECT 17 Rename(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock to which ARG2 is relative ARG2: BSTR Name of object to rename (relative to ARG1) ARG3: LOCK Lock associated with target directory ARG4: BSTR Requested new name for the object RES1: BOOL Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = DOSFALSE These three actions perform most of the work behind the AmigaDOS commands MakeDir, Delete, and Rename (for single files). These packets take as their parameters a lock describing where the file is and a name relative to that lock. It is the responsibility of the file system to ensure that the operation is not going to cause adverse effects. In particular, the RENAME_OBJECT action allows moving files across directory bounds and as such must ensure that it doesn't create hidden directory loops by renaming a directory into a child of itself. For Directory objects, the DELETE_OBJECT action must ensure that the directory is empty before allowing the operation. ACTION_PARENT 29 Parent(...) ARG1: LOCK Lock on object to get the parent of RES1: LOCK Parent Lock RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = 0 This action receives a lock on an object and creates a shared lock on the object's parent. If the original object has no parent, then a lock of 0 is returned. Note that this operation is typically used in the process of constructing the absolute path name of a given object. ACTION_SET_PROTECT 21 SetProtection(...) ARG1: Unused ARG2: LOCK Lock to which ARG3 is relative ARG3: BSTR Name of object (relative to ARG2) ARG4: LONG Mask of new protection bits RES1: BOOL Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = DOSFALSE This action allows an application to modify the protection bits of an object. The 4 lowest order bits (RWED) are a bit peculiar. If their respective bit is set, that operation is not allowed (i.e. if a file's delete bit is set the file is not deleteable). By default, files are created with the RWED bits set and all others cleared. Additionally, any action which modifies a file is required to clear the A (archive) bit. See the dos/dos.h include file for the definitions of the bit fields. ACTION_SET_COMMENT 28 SetComment(...) ARG1: Unused ARG2: LOCK Lock to which ARG3 is relative ARG3: BSTR Name of object (relative to ARG2) ARG4: BSTR New Comment string RES1: BOOL Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = DOSFALSE This action allows an application to set the comment string of an object. If the object does not exist then DOSFALSE will be returned in RES1 with the failure code in RES2. The comment string is limited to 79 characters. ACTION_SET_DATE 34 SetFileDate(...) in 2.0 ARG1: Unused ARG2: LOCK Lock to which ARG3 is relative ARG3: BSTR Name of Object (relative to ARG2) ARG4: CPTR DateStamp RES1: BOOL Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = DOSFALSE This action allows an application to set an object's creation date. ACTION_FH_FROM_LOCK 1026 OpenFromLock(lock) ARG1: BPTR BPTR to file handle to fill in ARG2: LOCK Lock of file to open RES1: BOOL Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = NULL This action open a file from a given lock. If this action is successful, the file system will essentially steal the lock so a program should not use it anymore. If ACTION_FH_FROM_LOCK fails, the lock is still usable by an application. ACTION_SAME_LOCK 40 SameLock(lock1,lock2) ARG1: BPTR Lock 1 to compare ARG2: BPTR Lock 2 to compare RES1: LONG Result of comparison, one of DOSTRUE if locks are for the same object DOSFALSE if locks are on different objects RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is LOCK_DIFFERENT This action compares the targets of two locks. If they point to the same object, ACTION_SAME_LOCK should return LOCK_SAME. ACTION_MAKE_LINK 1021 MakeLink(name,targ,mode) ARG1: BPTR Lock on directory ARG2 is relative to ARG2: BSTR Name of the link to be created (relative to ARG1) ARG3: BPTR Lock on target object or name (for soft links). ARG4: LONG Mode of link, either LINK_SOFT or LINK_HARD RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE This packet causes the file system to create a link to an already existing file or directory. There are two kinds of links, hard links and soft links. The basic difference between them is that a file system resolves a hard link itself, while the file system passes a string back to DOS telling it where to find a soft linked file or directory. To the packet level programmer, there is essentially no difference between referencing a file by its original name or by its hard link name. In the case of a hard link, ARG3 is a lock on the file or directory that the link is ``linked'' to, while in a soft link, ARG3 is a pointer (CPTR) to a C-style string. In an over-simplified model of the ROM file system, when asked to locate a file, the system scans a disk looking for a file header with a specific (file) name. That file header points to the actual file data somewhere on the disk. With hard links, more than one file header can point to the same file data, so data can be referenced by more than one name. When the user tries to delete a hard link to a file, the system first checks to see if there are any other hard links to the file. If there are, only the hard link is deleted, the actual file data the hard link used to reference remains, so the existing hard links can still use it. In the case where the original link (not a hard or soft link) to a file is deleted, the file system will make one of its hard links the new ``real'' link to the file. Hard links can exist on directories as well. Because hard links ``link'' directly to the underlying media, hard links in one file system cannot reference objects in another file system. Soft links are resolved through DOS calls. When the file system scans a disk for a file or directory name and finds that the name is a soft link, it returns an error code (ERROR_IS_SOFT_LINK). If this happens, the application must ask the file system to tell it what the link the link refers to by calling ACTION_READ_LINK. Soft Links are stored on the media, but instead of pointing directly to data on the disk, a soft link contains a path to its object. This path can be relative to the lock in ARG1, relative to the volume (where the string will be prepended by a colon ':'), or an absolute path. An absolute path contains the name of another volume, so a soft link can reference files and directories on other disks. ACTION_READ_LINK 1024 ReadLink(port,lck,nam,buf,len) ARG1: BPTR Lock on directory that ARG2 is relative to ARG2: CPTR Path and name of link (relative to ARG1). NOTE: This is a C string not a BSTR ARG3: APTR Buffer for new path string ARG4: LONG Size of buffer in bytes RES1: LONG Actual length of returned string, -2 if there isn't enough space in buffer,or -1 for other errors RES2: CODE Failure code This action reads a link and returns a path name to the link's object. The link's name (plus any necessary path) is passed as a CPTR (ARG2) which points to a C-style string, not a BSTR. ACTION_READ_LINK returns the path name in ARG3. The length of the target string is returned in RES1 (or a -1 indicating an error). ACTION_CHANGE_MODE 1028 ChangeMode(type,obj,mode) ARG1: LONG Type of object to change - either CHANGE_FH or CHANGE_LOCK ARG2: BPTR object to be changed ARG3: LONG New mode for object - see ACTION_FINDINPUT, and ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE This action requests that the handler change the mode of the given file handle or lock to the mode in ARG3. This request should fail if the handler can't change the mode as requested (for example an exclusive request for an object that has multiple users). ACTION_COPY_DIR_FH 1030 DupLockFromFH(fh) ARG1: LONG fh_Arg1 of file handle RES1: BPTR Lock associated with file handle or NULL RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = NULL This action requests that the handler return a lock associated with the currently opened file handle. The request may fail for any restriction imposed by the file system (for example when the file handle is not opened in a shared mode). The file handle is still usable after this call, unlike the lock in ACTION_FH_FROM_LOCK. ACTION_PARENT_FH 1031 ParentOfFH(fh) ARG1: LONG fh_Arg1 of File handle to get parent of RES1: BPTR Lock on parent of a file handle RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 = NULL This action obtains a lock on the parent directory (or root of the volume if at the top level) for a currently opened file handle. The lock is returned as a shared lock and must be freed. Note that unlike ACTION_COPY_DIR_FH, the mode of the file handle is unimportant. For an open file, ACTION_PARENT_FH should return a lock under all circumstances. ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL 1033 ExAll(lock,buff,size,type,ctl) ARG1: BPTR Lock on directory to examine ARG2: APTR Buffer to store results ARG3: LONG Length (in bytes) of buffer (ARG2) ARG4: LONG Type of request - one of the following: ED_NAME Return only file names ED_TYPE Return above plus file type ED_SIZE Return above plus file size ED_PROTECTION Return above plus file protection ED_DATE Return above plus 3 longwords of date ED_COMMENT Return above plus comment or NULL ARG5: BPTR Control structure to store state information. The control structure must be allocated with AllocDosObject()! RES1: LONG Continuation flag - DOSFALSE indicates termination RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE This action allows an application to obtain information on multiple directory entries. It is particularly useful for applications that need to obtain information on a large number of files and directories. This action fills the buffer (ARG2) with partial or whole ExAllData structures. The size of the ExAllData structure depends on the type of request. If the request type field (ARG4) is set to ED_NAME, only the ed_Name field is filled in. Instead of copying the unused fields of the ExAllData structure into the buffer, ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL truncates the unused fields. This effect is cumulative, so requests to fill in other fields in the ExAllData structure causes all fields that appear in the structure before the requested field will be filled in as well. Like the ED_NAME case mentioned above, any field that appears after the requested field will be truncated (see the ExAllData structure below). For example, if the request field is set to ED_COMMENT, ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL fills in all the fields of the ExAllData structure, because the ed_Comment field is last. This is the only case where the packet returns entire ExAllData structures. struct ExAllData { struct ExAllData *ed_Next; UBYTE *ed_Name; LONG ed_Type; ULONG ed_Size; ULONG ed_Prot; ULONG ed_Days; ULONG ed_Mins; ULONG ed_Ticks; UBYTE *ed_Comment; /* strings will be after last used field. Note: */ }; /* Bug in V37 FFS treats this as a BSTR. */ Each ExAllData structure entry has an ead_Next field which points to the next ExAllData structure. Using these links, a program can easily chain through the ExAllData structures without having to worry about how large the structure is. Do not examine the fields beyond those requested as they certainly will not be initialized (and will probably overlay the next entry). The most important part of this action is the ExAllControl structure. It must be allocated and freed through AllocDosObject()/FreeDosObject(). This allows the structure to grow if necessary with future revisions of the operating and file systems. Currently, ExAllControl contains four fields: Entries - This field is maintained by the file system and indicates the actual number of entries present in the buffer after the action is complete. Note that a value of zero is possible here as no entries may match the match string. LastKey - This field must be initialized to 0 by the calling application before using this packet for the first time. This field is maintained by the file system as a state indicator of the current place in the list of entries to be examined. The file system may test this field to determine if this is the first or a subsequent call to this action. MatchString - This field points to a pattern matching string parsed by ParsePattern() or ParsePatternNoCase(). The string controls which directory entries are returned. If this field is NULL, then all entries are returned. Otherwise, this string is used to pattern match the names of all directory entries before putting them into the buffer. The default AmigaDOS pattern match routine is used unless MatchFunc is not NULL (see below). Note that it is not acceptable for the application to change this field between subsequent calls to this action for the same directory. MatchFunc - This field contains a pointer to an alternate pattern matching routine to validate entries. If it is NULL then the standard AmigaDOS wild card routines will be used. Otherwise, MatchFunc points to a hook function that is called in the following manner: BOOL = MatchFunc(hookptr, data,typeptr) A0 A1 A2 hookptr Pointer to hook being called data Pointer to (partially) filled in ExAllData for item being checked. typeptr Pointer to longword indicating the type of the ExAll request (ARG4). This function is expected to return DOSTRUE if the entry is accepted and DOSFALSE if it is to be discarded. ACTION_EXAMINE_FH 1034 ExamineFH(fh,fib) ARG1: BPTR File handle on open file ARG2: BPTR FileInfoBlock to fill in RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE This function examines a file handle and fills in the FileInfoBlock (found in ARG2) with information about the current state of the file. This routine is analogous to the ACTION_EXAMINE_OBJECT action for locks. Because it is not always possible to provide an accurate file size (for example when buffers have not been flushed or two processes are writing to a file), the fib_Size field (see dos/dos.h) may be inaccurate. ACTION_ADD_NOTIFY 4097 StartNotify(NotifyRequest) ARG1: BPTR NotifyRequest structure RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE This action asks a file system to notify the calling program if a particular file is altered. A file system notifies a program either by sending a message or by signaling a task. struct NotifyRequest { UBYTE *nr_Name; UBYTE *nr_FullName; /* set by dos - don't touch */ ULONG nr_UserData; /* for applications use */ ULONG nr_Flags; union { struct { struct MsgPort *nr_Port; /* for SEND_MESSAGE */ } nr_Msg; struct { struct Task *nr_Task; /* for SEND_SIGNAL */ UBYTE nr_SignalNum; /* for SEND_SIGNAL */ UBYTE nr_pad[3]; } nr_Signal; } nr_stuff; ULONG nr_Reserved[4]; /* leave 0 for now */ /* internal use by handlers */ ULONG nr_MsgCount; /* # of outstanding msgs */ struct MsgPort *nr_Handler; /* handler sent to (for EndNotify) */ }; To use this packet, an application needs to allocate and initialize a NotifyRequest structure (see above). As of this writing, NotifyRequest structures are not allocated by AllocDosObject(), but this may change in the future. The handler gets the watched file's name from the nr_FullName field. The current file system does not currently support wild cards in this field, although there is nothing to prevent other handlers from doing so. The string in nr_FullName must be an absolute path, including the name of the root volume (no assigns). The absolute path is necessary because the file or its parent directories do not have to exist when the notification is set up. This allows notification on files in directories that do not yet exist. Notification will not occur until the directories and file are created. An application that uses the StartNotify() DOS call does not fill in the NotifyRequest's nr_FullName field, but instead fills in the nr_Name field. StartNotify() takes the name from the nr_Name field and uses GetDeviceProc() and NameFromLock() to expand any assigns (such as ENV:), storing the result in nr_FullName. Any application utilizing the packet level interface instead of StartNotify() must expand their own assigns. Handlers must not count on nr_Name being correct. The notification type depends on which bit is set in the NotifyRequest.nr_Flags field. If the NRF_SEND_MESSAGE bit is set, an application receives notification of changes to the file through a message (see NotifyMessage from dos/notify.h). In this case, the nr_Port field must point to the message port that will receive the notifying message . If the nr_Flags NRF_SEND_SIGNAL bit is set, the file system will signal a task instead of sending a message. In this case, nr_Task points to the task and nr_SignalNum is the signal number. Only one of these two bits should be set! When an application wants to limit the number of NotifyMessages an handler can send per NotifyRequest, the application sets the NRF_WAIT_REPLY bit in the nr_Flags field. This bit tells the handler not to send new NotifyMessages to a NotifyRequest's message port if the application has not returned a previous NotifyMessage. This pertains only to a specific NotifyRequest--if other NotifyRequests exist on the same file (or directory) the handler will still send NotifyMessages to the other NotifyRequest's message ports. The NRF_WAIT_REPLY bit only applies to message notification. If an application needs to know if a file or directory exists at the time the application sets up notification on that file or directory, the application can set the NRF_NOTIFY_INITIAL bit in the nr_Flags field. If the file or directory exists, the handler sends an initial message or gives an initial signal. Handlers should only perform a notification when the actual contents of the file have changed. This includes ACTION_WRITE, ACTION_SET_DATE, ACTION_DELETE, ACTION_RENAME_OBJECT, ACTION_FINDUPDATE, ACTION_FINDINPUT, and ACTION_FINDOUTPUT. It may also include other actions such as ACTION_SET_COMMENT or ACTION_SET_PROTECT, but this is not required (and may not be expected by the application as there is no need to reread the data). ACTION_REMOVE_NOTIFY 4098 EndNotify(NotifyRequest) ARG1: BPTR Pointer to previously added notify request RES1: BOOL Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE) RES2: CODE Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE This action cancels a notification (see ACTION_ADD_NOTIFY) . ARG1 is the NotifyRequest structure used to initiate the notification. The handler should abandon any pending notification messages. Note that it is possible for a file system to receive a reply from a previously sent notification message even after the notification has been terminated. It should accept these messages silently and throw them away. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
