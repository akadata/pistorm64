SYNOPSIS success = CopyToBuff(to, from, n) d0 a0 a1 d0 BOOL CopyToBuff(VOID *, VOID *, ULONG); FUNCTION This function first does any initialization and/or allocation required to prepare the abstract data structure pointed at by 'to' to be filled with 'n' bytes of data from 'from'. It then executes the copy operation. If, for example, there is not enough memory available to prepare the abstract data structure, the call is failed and FALSE is returned. The buffer management scheme should be such that any memory needed to fulfill CopyToBuff() calls is already allocated from the system before the call to CopyToBuff() is made. INPUTS to - pointer to abstract structure to copy to. from - pointer to contiguous memory to copy from. n - number of bytes to copy. RESULT success - TRUE if operation was successful, else FALSE. EXAMPLE NOTES This function must be callable from interupts. In particular, this means that this function may not directly or indirectly call any system memory functions (since those functions rely on Forbid() to protect themselves) and that you must not compile this function with stack checking enabled. See the RKM:Libraries Exec:Interupts chapter for more details on what is legal in a routine called from an interupt handler. 'C' programmers should not compile with stack checking (option '-v' in SAS) and should geta4() or __saveds. BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
