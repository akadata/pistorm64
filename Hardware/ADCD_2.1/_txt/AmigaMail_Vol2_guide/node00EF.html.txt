TITLE: BBOX (0x42424F48) / Bounding box of next object in FORM /

BBOX (0x42424F48) / Bounding box of next object in FORM / ]" border=0> The BBOX chunk supplies the dimensions and position of a bounding box surrounding the DR2D object that follows this chunk in the FORM. A BBOX chunk can apply to a FILL or AROW as well as a DR2D object. The BBOX chunk appears just before its DR2D object, FILL, or AROW chunk. struct BBOXstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; IEEE XMin, YMin, /* Bounding box of obj. */ XMax, YMax; /* including line width */ }; In a Cartesian coordinate system, the point (XMin, YMin) is the coordinate of the lower left hand corner of the bounding box and (XMax, YMax) is the upper right. These coordinates take into consideration the width of the lines making up the bounding box. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
