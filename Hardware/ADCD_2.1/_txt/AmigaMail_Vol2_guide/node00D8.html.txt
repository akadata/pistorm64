TITLE: Width Lists

Width Lists ]" border=0> An application can find the widths of a typeface's glyphs using the OT_WidthList tag with one of the ObtainInfo() functions. The engine expects the OT_WidthList value to be an address where it can place the address of a MinList structure. This MinList points to a list of GlyphWidthEntry structures. The GlyphWidthEntry structure (defined in ) is for reading only and looks like this: struct GlyphWidthEntry { struct MinNode gwe_Node; /* on list returned by OT_WidthList */ /* inquiry */ UWORD gwe_Code; /* entry's character code value */ FIXED gwe_Width; /* character advance, as fraction of */ /* em width */ }; The MinList contains an entry for each valid Unicode glyph ranging from the primary glyph, OT_GlyphCode, through the secondary glyph, OT_GlyphCode2. The engine does not create a GlyphWidthEntry structure for codes without glyphs (for example the codes before the space character in the Latin-1 character set). When an application is finished with the width list, it must use one of the ReleaseInfo() functions to relinquish the list. This function uses the same format as the ObtainInfo() functions, except the data value of the OT_WidthList tag is a pointer to the MinList (rather than a pointer to a pointer). The primary and secondary code values do not have to remain constant while an application is using a width list. The engine deallocates the width list resources independently of the primary and secondary code values, so these can change after obtaining a width list. The following code fragment asks the scaling engine, ge, for a list of character widths of the Unicode glyphs ranging from unicode (OT_GlyphCode) to unicode2 (OT_GlyphCode2), inclusive. The fragment steps through the list of widths, printing each one. struct MinList *widthlist; struct GlyphWidthEntry *widthentry; . . . if (SetInfo(ge, OT_GlyphCode, unicode, OT_GlyphCode2, unicode2, TAG_END) == OTERR_Success) { if (ObtainInfo(ge, OT_WidthList, &widthlist, TAG_END) == OTERR_Success) { for (widthentry = (struct GlyphWidthEntry *) widthlist->mlh_Head; widthentry->gwe_Node.mln_Succ; widthentry = (struct GlyphWidthEntry *) widthentry->gwe_Node.mln_Succ) { printf("$%lx: %ld.%ld\n", widthentry->gwe_Code, widthentry->gwe_Width>>16, ((widthentry->gwe_Width&0xffff)*10000)>>16); } ReleaseInfo(ge, OT_WidthList, widthlist, TAG_END); } } . . . Notice that the ObtainInfo() functions (as well as the SetInfo() functions) return an error code (the error codes are defined in ). If that error code is equal to OTERR_Success, the operation was successful. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
