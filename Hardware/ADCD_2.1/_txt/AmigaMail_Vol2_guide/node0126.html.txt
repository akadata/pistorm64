TITLE: Configuration

Configuration ]" border=0> S2_DEVICEQUERY S2_CONFIGINTERFACE S2_GETSTATIONADDRESS The device driver needs to configure the hardware before using it. The driver user must know some network hardware parameters (hardware address and MTU, for example) when using it. These commands address those needs. When a driver user is initialized, it should try to S2_CONFIGINTERFACE even though an interface can only be configured once and someone else may have done it. Before you call S2_CONFIGINTERFACE, first call S2_GETSTATIONADDRESS to determine the factory address (if any). Also provide for user-override of the factory address (that address may be optional and the user may need to override it). When S2_CONFIGINTERFACE returns, check the ios2_SrcAddr for the actual address the hardware has been configured with. This is because some hardware (or serial line standards such as PPP) always dynamically allocates an address at initialization. Driver users will want to use S2_DEVICEQUERY to determine the MTU and other characteristics of the network. The structure returned from S2_DEVICEQUERY is defined as: struct Sana2DeviceQuery { ULONG SizeAvailable; ULONG SizeSupplied; ULONG DevQueryFormat; ULONG DeviceLevel; UWORD AddrFieldSize; ULONG MTU; ULONG BPS; ULONG HardwareType; }; SizeAvailable - Size, in bytes, of the space available in which to place device information. This includes both size fields. SizeSupplied - Size, in bytes, of the data supplied. DevQueryFormat - The format defined here is format 0. DeviceLevel - This spec defines level 0. AddrFieldSize - The number of bits in an interface address. MTU - Maximum Transmission Unit, the size, in bytes, of the maximum packet size, not including header and trailer information. BPS - Best guess at the raw line rate for this network in bits per second. HardwareType - Specifies the type of network hardware the driver controls. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
