I-3: 2.0 Version Strings ]" border=0> By Carolyn Scheppner Unlike the 1.3 version command, the 2.0 version command has the ability to search Amiga files for a version string. If you try the 2.0 version command on any of the 2.0 Workbench commands, you will find that almost all Workbench commands now contain these special version strings. For example, running version on the current version of SYS:Utilities/More will output More 37.2. This embedded version string provides a simple way for a user to determine the specific version of a command. This is extremely useful for bug reports and phone support. You may enter these strings in your code yourself and update them by hand when required, or you may automate updates by using the bumprev tool (provided on a variety of DevCon disk sets and also in the Preliminary Software Toolkit II).
