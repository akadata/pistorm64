TITLE: Kickstart 1.3 vs. 2.04

Kickstart 1.3 vs. 2.04 ]" border=0> The A570 connects to either an A500 running Kickstart 1.3 or 2.04, or an A500 Plus running Kickstart 2.04. It is imperative that your application work in both these environments. The A570 uses the Kickstart ROM routines found in the host computer. It contains its own ROMs which provide the CDTV-specific functions (cdtv.device, playerprefs.library, Audio control panel, CDTV Preferences, etc.) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
