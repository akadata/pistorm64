TITLE: sana2.device/S2_DEVICEQUERY

sana2.device/S2_DEVICEQUERY ]" border=0> NAME DeviceQuery -- Return parameters for this network interface. FUNCTION This command causes the device driver to report information about the device. Up to SizeAvailable bytes of the information is copied into a buffer pointed to by ios2_StatData. The format of the data is as follows: struct Sana2DeviceQuery { /* ** Standard information */ ULONG SizeAvailble; /* bytes available */ ULONG SizeSupplied; /* bytes supplied */ LONG DevQueryFormat; /* this is type 0 */ LONG DeviceLevel; /* this document is level 0 */ /* ** Common information */ UWORD AddrFieldSize; /* address size in bits */ ULONG MTU; /* maximum packet data size */ LONG bps; /* line rate (bits/sec) */ LONG HardwareType; /* what the wire is */ /* ** Format specific information */ }; The SizeAvailable specifies the number of bytes that the caller is prepared to accomodate, including the standard information fields. SizeSupplied is the number of bytes actually supplied, including the standard information fields, which will not exceed SizeAvailable. includes constants for these values. If your hardware does not have a number assigned to it, you must contact CATS to get a hardware number. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - S2_DEVICEQUERY. ios2_StatData - Pointer to Sana2DeviceQuery structure to fill in. RESULTS ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. NOTES SEE ALSO BUGS [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
