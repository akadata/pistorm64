Reserved Ports ]" border=0> Port numbers 1-255 are reserved for standard Internet applications (like ftp) and port numbers 256-1023 are reserved for standard Unix remote services (which are often available for machines other than Unix). You should never choose any of these port numbers for your application unless it is an implementation of a standard for which the port number is reserved. For more information on port numbering and reserved ports, see the " References " section at the end of this article. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
