TITLE: Opening Full Size Screens

Opening Full Size Screens ]" border=0> Under pre-V36 versions of the operating system, a method commonly used to open a screen according to user preference was to "clone" the Workbench screen (to create a screen with the same resolution and view mode as the Workbench screen). Normally, applications called the Intuition function GetScreenData() to learn the Workbench screen's resolution and display mode. Programmers should no longer rely on GetScreenData() to return the actual resolution and display mode under release 2.0. When asked about the Workbench screen, the V2.0 GetScreenData() returns the video mode of a Hires screen, or, if the screen is interlaced, a Hires interlaced screen. The dimensions GetScreenData() returns will be the lesser of either the OSCAN_TEXT dimensions or the actual Workbench screen dimensions. This change to GetScreenData() prevents some programs developed for 1.3 from opening full size screens and windows under 2.0. The change had to be made to avoid confusing programs that couldn't handle the higher resolutions and new display modes that are available in release 2.0. For example, when GetScreenData() is called on a system using a SuperHires interlaced Workbench screen, it returns the dimensions and view mode of a Hires interlaced screen. If GetScreenData() had supplied the actual resolution instead, a program that assumed the resolution could not be greater than 640x400 could be severely crippled. The exception to this rule is a system running in one of the A2024 (or Hedley Hires) modes. To remain compatible with the V35 version of GetScreenData(), the release 2.0 version returns the correct dimensions of a screen in A2024 mode. Another method previously used to get information about the Workbench screen was to look at the GfxBase->NormalDisplayRows and GfxBase->NormalDisplayColumns fields. As with GetScreenData(), these fields contain the dimensions of a text overscan Hires (or Hires interlace) screen. Obviously, these fields should no longer be used to obtain the actual dimensions of the Workbench screen. To clone the Workbench screen under 2.0, lock the Workbench screen, get the screen's display mode ID, and get the necessary display information. The article " An Introduction to V36 Screens and Windows " from the September/October 1990 issue of Amiga Mail contains the example CloneWB.c which illustrates cloning the Workbench screen under release 2.0. Any application that wants to clone the Workbench screen should be prepared to handle any type of screen, because the user can change the Workbench screen to any type of screen they desire.
