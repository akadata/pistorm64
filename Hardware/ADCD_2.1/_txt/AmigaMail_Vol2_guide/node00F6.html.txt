TITLE: TPTH (0x54505448) / A text string along a path /

TPTH (0x54505448) / A text string along a path / ]" border=0> This chunk defines a path (polygon) and supplies a string to render along the edge of the path. struct TPTHstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; UBYTE Justification; /* see defines, below */ UBYTE WhichFont; /* Which font to use */ IEEE CharW, CharH; /* W/H of an individual char */ USHORT NumChars; /* Number of chars in the string */ USHORT NumPoints; /* Number of points in the path */ char TextChars[NumChars];/* PAD TO EVEN #! */ IEEE Path[2*NumPoints]; /* The path on which the text lies */ }; WhichFont contains the ID of the font used to render the text. Justification controls how the text is justified on the line. Justification can be one of the following values: #define J_LEFT 0x00 /* Left justified */ #define J_RIGHT 0x01 /* Right justified */ #define J_CENTER 0x02 /* Center text */ #define J_SPREAD 0x03 /* Spread text across path */ CharW and CharH are the average width and height of the font characters and are akin to X and Y font sizes, respectively. A negative FontH implies that the font is upsidedown. Note that CharW must not be negative. NumChars is the number of characters in the TextChars[] string, the string containing the text to be rendered. NumPoints is the number of points in the Path[] array. Path[] is the path along which the text is rendered. The path itself is not rendered. The points of Path[] are in the same format as the points of a DR2D polygon. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
