TITLE: Parsing

Parsing ]" border=0> When you want to use a string as an AmigaDOS wildcard pattern, the system must first parse it. The system builds a token string which the system uses to match strings. There are two functions in dos.library to parse pattern matching strings: LONG ParsePattern(UBYTE *SourcePattern, UBYTE *MyDestination, LONG DestLength); LONG ParsePatternNoCase(UBYTE *SourcePattern, UBYTE *MyDestination, LONG DestLength); The ParsePattern() function creates a case sensitive token string, whereas the ParsePatternNoCase() functions creates a case insensitive token string. Both functions require a pointer to a destination buffer (MyDestination in the above prototype) to place the tokenized string in. Since every character in the pattern can be expanded to two tokens (3 in one case), this buffer should be at twice as as large as the original pattern plus 2 bytes. As a general rule, allocating a buffer three times the size of the pattern will hold all patterns. The third argument, DestLength, indicates the size of the destination buffer provided. These functions will returns one of three values: -1 if there is an error (if the buffer is too small to hold all the tokens or the source string contains an invalid pattern), 1 if the wildcard pattern was parsed successfully and the pattern contains one of the special token characters. 0 if the wildcard pattern was parsed successfully and pattern contained only alphanumeric characters (no special token characters) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
