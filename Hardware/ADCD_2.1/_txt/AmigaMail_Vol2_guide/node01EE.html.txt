TITLE: sana2.device/S2_BROADCAST

sana2.device/S2_BROADCAST ]" border=0> NAME Broadcast -- Broadcast a packet on network. FUNCTION This command works the same as CMD_WRITE except that it also performs whatever special processing of the packet is required to do a broadcast send. The actual broadcast mechanism is neccessarily network/interface/device specific. IO REQUEST ios2_Command - S2_BROADCAST. ios2_Flags - Supported flags are: SANA2IOB_RAW SANA2IOB_QUICK ios2_PacketType - Packet type to send. ios2_DataLength - Length of the Data to be sent. ios2_Data - Abstract data structure which packet data is contained in. RESULTS ios2_DstAddr - The contents of this field are to be considered trash upon return of the IOReq. ios2_Error - Zero if successful; non-zero otherwise. This command can fail for many reasons and is not supported by all networks and/or network interfaces. ios2_WireError - More specific error number. NOTES The DstAddr field may be trashed by the driver because this function may be implemented by filling DstAddr with a broadcast address and internally calling CMD_WRITE.
