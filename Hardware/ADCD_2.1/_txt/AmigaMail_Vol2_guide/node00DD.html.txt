TITLE: About the Examples

About the Examples ]" border=0> This article contains two code examples. The first, Rotate.c , rotates a user-specified glyph around a central point. By default, it rotates a 36 point 'A' using the font fonts:CGTimes.font. If Rotate finds an AmigaDOS environment variable called "XYDPI", it will use the X and Y DPI it finds in that variable as the default target device DPI (see the description of the Level 0 OT_DeviceDPI tag). If that variable is not defined, Rotate will use an XDPI of 68 and a YDPI of 27 which, nominally, is the X and Y DPI of a standard Hires display. The second example, View.c , displays a file using the same defaults as Rotate. View utilizes kerning pairs to display its glyphs. Because View only considers "visible" characters, it ignores characters that have widths but no glyph. The result is, View doesn't print any space characters. If View were smarter, it would ask the scaling engine for a width list so it could properly advance the current pointer when it comes across a space or some other character without a glyph. Notice that View uses a slightly modified version of BulletMain.c called BulletMainFile.c . Only BulletMain.c appears in the example code. The only significant difference between the two is that BulletMainFile.c obtains a file name for View to display. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
