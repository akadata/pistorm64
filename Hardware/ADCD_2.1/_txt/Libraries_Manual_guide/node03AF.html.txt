28 / / Detecting Gel Collisions / VSprite Collision Mask ]" border=0> The CollMask member of the VSprite is a pointer to a memory area allocated for holding the collision mask of that GEL. This area must be in Chip memory and its size is the equivalent of one bitplane of the GEL's image. The collision mask is usually the same as the shadow mask of the GEL, formed from a logical-OR combination of all planes of the image. The following figure shows an example collision mask. If this is the ...and this is the ...then its image in plane 1... image in plane 2...

In this case, the actual image isn't relevant. The system will not register collisions unless the other objects touch the collision mask. If the collision mask is smaller than the image, other objects will pass through the edges without a collision. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
