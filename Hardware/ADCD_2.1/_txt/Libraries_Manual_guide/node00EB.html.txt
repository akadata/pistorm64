3 Intuition Screens / DrawInfo and the 3D Look ]" border=0> In Release 2, whenever a new screen is created, Intuition also creates an auxiliary data structure called a DrawInfo . The DrawInfo structure provides information Intuition uses to support the new 3D look of Release 2 and specifies graphical information for applications that use the screen. The information includes such items as aspect ratio (resolution), font, number of colors and drawing pens. struct DrawInfo { UWORD dri_Version; /* will be DRI_VERSION */ UWORD dri_NumPens; /* guaranteed to be >= numDrIPens */ UWORD *dri_Pens; /* pointer to pen array */ struct TextFont *dri_Font; /* screen default font */ UWORD dri_Depth; /* (initial) depth of screen bitmap */ struct { /* from DisplayInfo database for initial display mode */ UWORD X; UWORD Y; } dri_Resolution; ULONG dri_Flags; /* defined below */ ULONG dri_Reserved[7]; /* avoid recompilation ;^) */ }; Before an application uses fields in the DrawInfo structure, it should check the version of the structure to ensure that all fields are available. If the field dri_Version is greater than or equal to the constant DRI_VERSION that the application was compiled with, it can be assured that all fields in DrawInfo that it knows about are being supported by Intuition.
