TITLE: 5 / Gadget Size and Position / Positioning Gadgets in Window Borders

5 / Gadget Size and Position / Positioning Gadgets in Window Borders ]" border=0> Gadgets may be placed in the borders of a window. To do this, set one or more of the border flags in the Gadget structure and position the gadget in the window border. Setting these flags also tells Intuition to adjust the size of the window's borders to accommodate the gadget. Borders are adjusted only when the window is opened. Although the application can add and remove gadgets with AddGList() and RemoveGList() after the window is opened, Intuition does not readjust the borders. A gadget may be placed into two borders by setting multiple border flags. If a gadget is to be placed in two borders, it only makes sense to put the gadget into adjoining borders. Setting both side border flags or both the top and bottom border flags for a particular gadget, will create a window that is all border. See the SuperBitMap example, lines.c , in the "Intuition Windows" chapter for an example of creating proportional gadgets that are positioned within a window's borders. There are circumstances where the border size will not adjust properly so that the gadget has the correct visual appearance. One way to correct this problem is to place a "hidden" gadget into the border, which forces the border to the correct size. Such a gadget would have no imagery and would not cause any IDCMP messages to be sent on mouse button activity. The gadget should be placed at the end of the gadget list of the window, so that it does not cover up any other border gadgets. Sometimes the sizing gadget can be used to adjust the width of the borders, as in the case of proportional gadgets in the right or bottom border. The proportional gadget will only increase the width of the border by enough so that the select box of the gadget fits within the border, no space is reserved between the gadget and the inner edge of the window. By placing the size gadget in both borders (using the window flags WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT and WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM ), the prop gadget sizes can be adjusted so that there is an even margin on all sides. This technique is used in the lines.c example mentioned above. size gadget in size gadget in size gadget in both borders bottom border side border -------------- -------------- -------------- | | || | | | | || | | | | || | | | | || | | | | || | | _____|_____| __________|| |_____| | | | | | | | /|| | /|| | /|| | / || | / || | / || | /__|| | /__|| _____| /__|| _____|_____| _____|_____| _____|_____| Figure 5-2: Size Gadget in Various Window Border Combinations The border flags GACT_RIGHTBORDER , GACT_LEFTBORDER , GACT_TOPBORDER and GACT_BOTTOMBORDER which are set in the Activation field of the Gadget structure declare that the gadget will be positioned in the border. Gadgets which are declared to be in the border are automatically refreshed by Intuition whenever the window borders need to be redrawn. This prevents the gadget imagery from being obliterated. Some applications forgot to declare some of their gadgets as being in the border. While they looked fine prior to V36, they would have had some gadget imagery overwritten by the new style of window borders introduced with that release. To ensure compatibility with such applications, Intuition attempts to identify gadgets that are substantially in the border but do not have the appropriate border flags set. Such gadgets are marked for the same refresh treatment as explicit border gadgets. Applications should not rely on this behavior, but should instead declare their border gadgets properly. Gadgets that are not declared to be in the border, and whose dimensions are 1 x 1 or smaller are never marked by Intuition as being effectively in the border. This is because some applications tuck a small non-selectable gadget (of size 0x0 or 1x1) into the window border, and attach imagery for the window to that gadget. The application does this to get automatic refresh of that imagery, since Intuition refreshes gadget imagery when window damage occurs. Beginning with V36, Intuition attempts to locate gadgets within the border that do not have the appropriate flags set. This may cause gadgets to appear in the border when the application has not set any of the border flags. Applications should not rely on this behavior, nor should they place non-border gadgets fully or partially within the window's borders. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
