TITLE: 3 / Types of Screens / Public Screens and Custom Screens

3 / Types of Screens / Public Screens and Custom Screens ]" border=0> An application may choose to use an existing screen or to create its own screen. For instance, the normal Amiga startup process opens the Workbench screen ( Workbench is the Amiga's default user interface). Any application is free to use the Workbench screen instead of opening a new one. Screens that can be shared this way are called public screens. Public screens are a new feature of Release 2 (V36). In older versions of the OS, only the Workbench screen could be shared. Now any screen may be set up as a public screen so that other applications may use it. The use of an existing public screen, like the Workbench screen, requires little effort by the application and does not use up any memory. However, using Workbench or another existing public screen means some flexibility is lost; the resolution, maximum number of colors and other attributes are already set. If the application cannot function under these limitations, it may open its own custom screen. Custom screens allow for complete control of the display space so an application can get exactly the kind of display it wants. However, since creating a new, custom screen uses up memory, they should only be used when there are no suitable public screens available. Owners of a custom screen can keep their screen private, or they may allow other applications to share their screen by registering the screen with the operating system as a public screen. See the section on " Public Screen Functions " later in this chapter for more about public screens and Workbench. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
