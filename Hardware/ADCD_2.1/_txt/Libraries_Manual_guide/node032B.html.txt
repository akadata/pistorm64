TITLE: 27 / Display Routines and Structures / Viewport Display Memory

27 / Display Routines and Structures / Viewport Display Memory ]" border=0> The picture you create in memory can be larger than the screen image that can be displayed within your ViewPort. This big picture (called a raster and represented by the BitMap structure) can have a maximum size dependent upon the version of the Agnus chip in the Amiga. The ECS Agnus can handle rasters up to 16,384 by 16,384 pixels. Older Agnus chips are limited to rasters up to 1,024 by 1,024 pixels. The section earlier in this chapter on " Determining Chip Versions " explains how to find out which Agnus is installed. The example in the following figure introduces terms that tell the system how to find the display data and how to display it in the ViewPort. These terms are RHeight, RWidth, RyOffset, RxOffset, DHeight , DWidth , DyOffset and DxOffset . Figure 27-16: ViewPort Data Area Parameters The terms RHeight and RWidth do not appear in actual system data structures. They refer to the dimensions of the raster and are used here to relate the size of the raster to the size of the display area. RHeight is the number of rows in the raster and RWidth is the number of bytes per row times 8. The raster shown in the figure is too big to fit entirely in the display area, so you tell the system which pixel of the raster should appear in the upper left corner of the display segment specified by your ViewPort. The variables that control that placement are RyOffset and RxOffset . To compute RyOffset and RxOffset , you need RHeight, RWidth, DHeight , and DWidth . The DHeight and DWidth variables define the height and width in pixels of the portion of the display that you want to appear in the ViewPort. The example shows a full-screen, low-resolution mode (320-pixel), non-interlaced (200-line) display formed from the larger overall picture. Normal values for RyOffset and RxOffset are defined by the formulas: 0 0 Once you have defined the size of the raster and the section of that raster that you wish to display, you need only specify where to put this ViewPort on the screen. This is controlled by the ViewPort variables DyOffset and DxOffset . These are offsets relative to the View.DxOffset and DyOffset . Possible NTSC values for DyOffset range from -23 to +217 (-46 to +434 if the ViewPort is interlaced), PAL values range from -15 to +267 (-30 to +534 for interlaced ViewPorts). Possible values for DxOffset range from -18 to +362 (-36 to +724 if the ViewPort is Hires, -72 to +1448 if SuperHires), when the View is in its default, initialized position. The parameters shown in the figure above are distributed in the following data structures: * View (information about the whole display) includes the variables that you use to position the whole display on the screen. The View structure contains a Modes field used to determine if the whole display is to be interlaced or non-interlaced. It also contains pointers to its list of ViewPorts and pointers to the Copper instructions produced by the system to create the display you have defined. * ViewPort (information about this segment of the display) includes the values DxOffset and DyOffset that are used to position this portion relative to the overall View. The ViewPort also contains the variables DHeight and DWidth , which define the size of this display segment; a Modes variable; and a pointer to the local ColorMap . Under Release 2, the VideoControl() function and its various tags are used to manipulate the ColorMap and ViewPort.Modes. Each ViewPort also contains a pointer to the next ViewPort. You create a linked list of ViewPorts to define the complete display. * RasInfo (information about the raster) contains the variables RxOffset and RyOffset . It also contains pointers to the BitMap structure and to a companion RasInfo structure if this is a dual playfield. * BitMap (information about memory usage) tells the system where to find the display and drawing area memory and shows how this memory space is organized, including the display's depth. You must allocate enough memory for the display you define. The memory you use for the display may be shared with the area control structures used for drawing. This allows you to draw into the same areas that you are currently displaying on the screen. As an alternative, you can define two BitMaps. One of them can be the active structure (that being displayed) and the other can be the inactive structure. If you draw into one BitMap while displaying another, the user cannot see the drawing taking place. This is called double-buffering of the display. See " Advanced Topics " below for an explanation of the steps required for double-buffering. Double-buffering takes twice as much memory as single-buffering because two full displays are produced. To determine the amount of required memory for each ViewPort for single-buffering, you can use the following formula. #include /* Depth, Width, and Height get set to something reasonable. */ UBYTE Depth, Width, Height; /* Calculate resulting VP size. */ bytes_per_ViewPort = Depth * RASSIZE(Width, Height); RASSIZE() is a system macro attuned to the current design of the system memory allocation for display rasters. See the gfx.h > include file for the formula with which RASSIZE() is calculated. For example, a 32-color ViewPort (depth = 5), 320 pixels wide by 200 lines high currently uses 40,000 bytes. A 16-color ViewPort (depth = 4), 640 pixels wide by 400 lines high currently uses 128,000 bytes. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
