TITLE: D / Errors / Memory Loss--During Execution

D / Errors / Memory Loss--During Execution ]" border=0> A continuing memory loss during execution can be caused by failure to keep up with voluminous IDCMP messages such as MOUSEMOVE messages. Intuition cannot re-use IDCMP message blocks until you ReplyMsg() them. If your window's allotted message blocks are all in use, new sets will be allocated and not freed till the window is closed. Continuing memory losses can also be caused by a program loop containing an allocation-type call without a corresponding free. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
