15 GadTools Library / GadTools Gadgets ]" border=0> The heart of GadTools is in its ability to easily create and manipulate a sophisticated and varied array of gadgets. GadTools supports the following kinds of gadgets: Table 15-1: Standard Gadget Types Supported by the GadTools Library Gadget Type Description or Example Usage ----------- ---------------------------- Button Familiar action gadgets, such as "OK" or "Cancel". String For text entry. Integer For numeric entry. Checkboxes For on/off items. Mutually exclusive Radio buttons, select one choice among several. Cycle Multiple-choice, pick one of a small number of choices. Sliders To indicate a level within a range. Scrollers To indicate a position in a list or area. Listviews Scrolling lists of text. Palette Color selection. Text-display Read-only text. Numeric-display Read-only numbers. GadTools gadget handling consists of a body of routines to create, manage and delete any of the 12 kinds of standard gadgets listed in table 15-1, such as buttons, sliders, mutually exclusive buttons and scrolling lists. To illustrate the flexibility, power and simplicity that GadTools offers, consider the GadTools slider gadget. This gadget is used to indicate and control the level of something, for example volume, speed or color intensity. Without GadTools, applications have to deal directly with Intuition proportional and their arcane variables, such as HorizBody to control the slider knob's size and HorizPot to control the knob's position. Using the GadTools slider allows direct specification of the minimum and maximum levels of the slider, as well as its current level. For example, a color slider might have a minimum level of 0, a maximum level of 15 and a current level of 11. To simplify event-processing for the slider, GadTools only sends the application a message when the knob has moved far enough to cause the slider level, as expressed in application terms, to change. If a user were to slowly drag the knob of this color slider all the way to the right, the program will only hear messages for levels 12, 13, 14 and 15, with an optional additional message when the user releases the mouse-button. Changing the current level of the slider from within the program is as simple as specifying the new level in a function call. For instance, the application might set the slider's value to 5. As a final point, the slider is very well-behaved. When the user releases the mouse-button, the slider immediately snaps to the centered position for the level. If a user sets their background color to light gray, which might have red = green = blue = 10, all three color sliders will have their knobs at precisely the same relative position, instead of anywhere in the range that means "ten".
