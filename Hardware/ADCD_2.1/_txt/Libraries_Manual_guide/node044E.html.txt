33 / / Storing LCIs / StoreLocalItem() ]" border=0> The StoreLocalItem() function is called as follows: error = StoreLocalItem (iff, lci, position); The position argument determines where the LCI is stored. The possible values are IFFSLI_ROOT, IFFSLI_TOP, and IFFSLI_PROP. IFFSLI_ROOT causes StoreLocalItem() to store your LCI in the default ContextNode . IFFSLI_TOP gets your LCI stored in the top (current) ContextNode . The LCI Ends When the Current Context Ends. ------------------------------------------- When the current context expires, your LCI will be deleted by the parser. IFFSLI_PROP causes your LCI to be stored in the topmost context from which a property would apply. This is usually the topmost FORM or LIST chunk. For example, suppose you had a deeply nested ILBM FORM , and you wanted to store the BMHD property in its correct context such that, when the current FORM context expired, the BMHD property would be deleted. IFFSLI_PROP will cause StoreLocalItem() to locate the proper context for such scoping, and store the LCI there. See the section on " Finding the Prop Context " for additional information on the scope of properties. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
