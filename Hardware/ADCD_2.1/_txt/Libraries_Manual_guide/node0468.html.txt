TITLE: Amiga® RKM Libraries: 34 Keymap Library

Amiga® RKM Libraries: 34 Keymap Library ]" border=0> Amiga computers are sold internationally with a variety of local keyboards which match the standards of particular countries. All Amigas have keyboards which are physically similar, and keys which output the same low-level raw key code for any particular physical key. However, in different countries, the keycaps of the keys may contain different letters or symbols. Since the physical position of a key determines the raw key code that it generates, raw key codes are not internationally compatible. For instance, on the German keyboard, the Y and Z keys are swapped when compared to the USA keyboard. The second key on the fifth row will generate the same raw key code on all Amiga keyboards, but should be decoded as a Z on a US keyboard and as a Y on a German keyboard. The Amiga uses the ECMA-94 Latin1 International 8-bit character set, and can map raw key codes to any desired ANSI character value, string, or escape sequence. This allows national keyboards to be supported by using keymaps. A keymap is a file which describes what character or string is tied to what key code. Generally, the user's startup-sequence will set a system default keymap that is correct for the user's keyboard. The console.device translates the raw key codes into the correct characters based on the installed keymap. This includes the translation of special deadkey sequential key combinations to produce accented international characters. Programs which perform keyboard input using the console.device, CON:, RAW:, or Intuition VANILLAKEY, will receive the correct ASCII values for a user's keycaps, based on their keymap. But some applications may require custom keymaps, or may need to perform their own translation between raw key codes and ANSI characters. In this chapter, the term ANSI refers to standard 8-bit character definitions which include printable ASCII characters, special characters, and escape sequences. Until V37, keymapping commands were only available in the console.device. Keymap.library is a new library in Release 2 (V37). It offers the some of the keymap commands of the console.device, enabling applications to inquire after the default keymap and map key codes to ANSI characters. It also provides the ability to map ANSI characters back into raw codes. Unlike the console.device however, it can not be used to select a keymap for only one application, i.e., one console window. As a prelude to the following material, note that the Amiga keyboard transmits raw key information to the computer in the form of a key position and a transition. Raw key positions range from hexadecimal 00 to 7F. When a key is released, its raw key position, plus hexadecimal 80, is transmitted.
