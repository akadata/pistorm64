TITLE: 5 / Gadget Imagery / Gadgets Without Imagery

5 / Gadget Imagery / Gadgets Without Imagery ]" border=0> Gadgets can be created without any defining imagery. This type of gadget may be used where mouse information is required but graphical definition of the gadget is not, or where the existing graphics sufficiently define the gadget that no additional imagery is required. A gadget with no imagery may be created by clearing the GFLG_GADGIMAGE flag in the gadget's Flags field, and by setting the gadget's GadgetRender and GadgetText fields to NULL. The text display of a word processor is a case where mouse information is required without any additional graphics. If a large gadget is placed over the text display, gadget and mouse event messages may be received at the IDCMP ( Window.UserPort ) when the mouse select button is either pressed or released. The mouse information is used to position the pointer in the text, or to allow the user to mark blocks of text. The drag bar of a window is another example of a gadget where existing imagery defines the gadget such that additional graphics are not required. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
