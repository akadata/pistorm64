TITLE: B / rootclass / New Methods: OM_NEW

B / rootclass / New Methods: OM_NEW ]" border=0> This method tells a class to create a new instance of itself. If OM_NEW is successful, it returns a pointer to the new object, otherwise it returns NULL. For programmers who are only creating Boopsi objects rather than creating custom classes, use the intuition.library function NewObject() : APTR NewObject(struct IClass *privateclass, UBYTE *publicclassname, ULONG firsttag, ...) The OM_NEW method receives the following arguments (defined in classusr.h >): struct opSet /* The OM_NEW method uses the same structure as OM_SET */ { ULONG MethodID; /* OM_NEW */ struct TagItem *ops_AttrList; /* tag attributes to initialize */ struct GadgetInfo *ops_GInfo; /* Always NULL for OM_NEW */ }; The ops_AttrList field contains a pointer to a tag list of attribute/value pairs. Each pair contains an attribute ID and the initial value of the corresponding attribute. The ops_GInfo field is always NULL for the OM_NEW method. Unlike other methods, when the dispatcher gets an OM_NEW message, the object pointer (newobject from the dispatchRKMModel() prototype above) does not point to an object, since the idea is to create a new object. The pointer normally used to pass a Boopsi object is instead used to pass the address of the object's "true class" (the class of which the object is an instance). The first thing the dispatcher does when it processes an OM_NEW message is pass the OM_NEW message on to its superclass's dispatcher. It does this using the amiga.lib function DoSuperMethodA() : ULONG DoSuperMethodA(Class *cl, Object *trueclass, Msg msg); Each superclass's dispatcher does this until the message gets to the rootclass dispatcher. Each class keeps a record of how much memory its local instance data requires. The rootclass dispatcher's OM_NEW method looks at the object's true class (newobject from the prototype) to find out how much memory to allocate for the object's instance data. The rootclass dispatcher allocates enough memory for the true class's local instance data, plus enough memory for the local instance data of each of the true class's superclasses. If all goes well, the rootclass dispatcher increments the true class's internal count of instances of true class, and returns a pointer to the newly created object. it passes control back to the subclass dispatcher that called it. If there was a problem, the rootclass dispatcher passes back a NULL. When the rootclass dispatcher returns, the subclass dispatcher regains control from DoSuperMethodA() . DoSuperMethodA() will return either a pointer to the new object or NULL if there was an error. Although the rootclass dispatcher allocated all the memory the object needs, it did not set up any of that memory. Now its the the subclass dispatcher's turn to do some work. It has to initialize the instance data that is local to its class. A dispatcher finds its local instance data by using the INST_DATA() macro (defined in classes.h >). After initializing its local instance data, the subclass dispatcher passes control down to its subclass dispatcher, which in turn, initializes its local instance data. Control passes down from class to subclass until the true class dispatcher regains control. Now the true class dispatcher has to initialize its local instance data. It has to scan through the tag list of attribute/value pairs passed in the OM_NEW message (opSet.ops_AttrList). If the dispatcher finds any attributes that the true class recognizes, it has to initialize them to the value passed in the attribute/value pair. At this point, the new object can allocate other resources it needs that it did not allocate as part of its instance data. For example, the new Boopsi object might need a frame image around itself, so it can create a new one using a Boopsi frame image. If the object allocates any resources in this step, it must deallocate these resources later when it is disposed in the OM_DISPOSE method. Finally, the dispatcher can return. When the dispatcher returns from an OM_NEW method, it returns a pointer to the new object. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
