33 / / Storing LCIs / FindLocalItem() ]" border=0> After you've stored your LCI in a ContextNode , you will no doubt want to be able to find it again later. You do this with the function FindLocalItem() , which is called as follows: lci = FindLocalItem (iff, type, id, ident); FindLocalItem() attempts to locate an LCI having the specified type, ID, and identification values. The search proceeds as follows (refer to Figure 33-3 to understand this better). FindLocalItem() starts at the top (current) ContextNode and searches all LCI s in that context. If no matching LCIs are found, it proceeds down the context stack to the next ContextNode and searches all its LCIs. The process repeats until it finds the desired LCI (whereupon it returns a pointer to it), or reaches the end without finding anything (where it returns NULL). Context Stack Position. ----------------------- LCI s higher in the stack will "override" lower LCIs with the same type, ID, and identification field. This is how property scoping is handled. As ContextNode s are popped off the context stack, all its LCIs are deleted as well. See the section on " Freeing LCIs " below for additional information on deleting LCIs.
