TITLE: 6 / Menu Data Structures / MenuItem Flags

6 / Menu Data Structures / MenuItem Flags ]" border=0> Here are the flags that can be set by the application in the Flags field of the MenuItem structure: CHECKIT Set this flag to inform Intuition that this item is a checkmark item and should be preceded by a checkmark if the flag CHECKED is set. CHECKED For an item with the CHECKIT flag set, set this bit to specify that the checkmark is displayed. After the menu strip is submitted to Intuition, it will maintain the CHECKED bit based on effects from other items' mutual exclusions, or, for MENUTOGGLE items, from user accesses to this item. ITEMTEXT Set this flag if the representation of the item pointed to by the ItemFill field and, possibly, by SelectFill is text and points to an IntuiText structure. Clear this bit if the item is graphic and points to an Image structure. COMMSEQ If this flag is set, this item has an equivalent command key sequence set in the Command field of the MenuItem structure. MENUTOGGLE This flag is used in conjunction with the CHECKIT flag. If MENUTOGGLE is set, a checkmark that is turned on may be turned off by selecting the item. This allows the user to toggle between the checked and non-checked states by repeatedly selecting the item. ITEMENABLED This flag describes whether or not this item is currently enabled. If an item is not enabled, its image will be ghosted and the user will not be able to select it. If this item has sub-items, all of the sub-items are disabled when the item is disabled. Set this flag before submitting the menu strip to Intuition. Once the menu strip has been submitted to Intuition, enable or disable items by calling OnMenu() or OffMenu() . HIGHFLAGS An item can be highlighted when the user positions the pointer over the item. These bits describe what type of highlighting will be used, if any. One of the following bits must be set, according to the type of highlighting desired: HIGHCOMP This complements all of the bits contained by this item's select box. HIGHBOX This draws a box outside this item's select box. HIGHIMAGE This displays alternate imagery referenced in SelectFill. For alternate text, make sure that ITEMTEXT is set, and that the SelectFill field points to an IntuiText structure. For alternate image, ITEMTEXT must be cleared, and the SelectFill field must point to an Image structure. HIGHNONE This specifies no highlighting. The following two flags are used by Intuition: ISDRAWN Intuition sets this flag when this item's sub-items are currently displayed to the user and clears it when they are not. HIGHITEM Intuition sets this flag when this item is highlighted and clears it when the item is not highlighted. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
