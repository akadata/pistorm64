D / Errors / Character Input/Output Problems ]" border=0> RAWKEY users must be aware that RAWKEY codes can be different letters or symbols on national keyboards. If you need to use RAWKEY, run the codes through RawKeyConvert() (see the " Intuition Input and Output Methods " chapter) to get proper translation to correct ASCII codes. Improper display or processing of high-ASCII international characters can be caused by incorrect tolower()/toupper(), or by sign extension of character values when switched on or assigned into larger size variables. Use unsigned variables such as UBYTE (not char) for strings and characters whenever possible. Internationally correct string functions are provided in the 2.0 utility.library.
