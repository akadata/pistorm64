8 / Creating Text / Text Colors and Drawing Modes ]" border=0> IntuiText gets its colors from the values set in the color registers for the screen in which they are rendered. The available number of colors and palette settings are screen attributes and cannot be changed through IntuiText rendering. Text characters in general are made up of two areas: the character image itself and the background area surrounding the character image. The color used in each area is determined by the draw mode which can be set to JAM1 , JAM2 or COMPLEMENT . The flag INVERSVID may also be specified. JAM1 draw mode renders each character with FrontPen and leaves the background area unaffected. Because the background of a character is not drawn, the pixels of the destination memory around the character image are not disturbed. Graphics beneath the text will be visible in the background area of each character cell. JAM2 draw mode renders each character with FrontPen and renders each character background with BackPen . Using this mode, any graphics that previously appeared beneath the character cells will be totally overwritten. COMPLEMENT draw mode renders the pixels of each character as the binary complement of the color that is currently at the destination pixel. The destination is the display memory where the text is drawn. As with JAM1 , nothing is drawn into the background. FrontPen and BackPen are not used in COMPLEMENT mode. To determine the complement color, invert all the bits in the binary representation of the color register number. The resulting number specifies the color register to use for that pixel. In a three bitplane display, for example, color 6 (110 in binary) is the complement of color 1 (001 in binary). The INVERSVID flag inverses the video for each of the drawing modes. For JAM1 , nothing is drawn into the character area and the background is drawn in FrontPen . For JAM2 , the character area is drawn in BackPen and the background is drawn in FrontPen. For COMPLEMENT mode, nothing is drawn into the character area and the background is complemented. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
