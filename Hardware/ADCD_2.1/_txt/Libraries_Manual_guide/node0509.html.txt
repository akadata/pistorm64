B / propgclass / Attributes: GA_Image (I) ]" border=0> Propgclass intercepts this gadgetclass attribute before passing it on to gadgetclass. This attribute passes an image for the prop gadget's knob, which gets stored in the propgclass object's Gadget.Image structure. If the propgclass does not get a GA_Image when it creates a prop gadget, the prop gadget's knob defaults to an AUTOKNOB. An AUTOKNOB automatically sizes itself according to how large the range of the gadget is compared to the visible range of the gadget. See the PGA_Visible and PGA_Total attributes for more details.
