TITLE: 31 / CxMessages / Shutting Down the Commodity

31 / CxMessages / Shutting Down the Commodity ]" border=0> Shutting down a commodity is easy. After replying to all CxMessages waiting at the broker 's message port, a commodity can delete its CxObjects . The DeleteCxObj() function removes a single CxObject from the Commodities network. DeleteCxObjAll() removes multiple objects. void DeleteCxObj( CxObj *co ); void DeleteCxObjAll( CxObj *delete_co ); If a commodity has a lot of CxObjects , deleting each individually can be a bit tedious. DeleteCxObjAll() will delete a CxObject and any other CxObjects that are attached to it. The HotKey.c example given later in this chapter uses this function to delete all its CxObjects. A commodity that uses DeleteCxObjAll() to delete all its CxObjects should make sure that they are all connected to the main one. (See the section " Connecting CxObjects " below.) After deleting its CxObjects , a commodity must take care of any CxMessages that might have arrived at the message port just before the commodity deleted its objects. while(msg = (CxMsg *)GetMsg(broker_mp)) ReplyMsg((struct Message *)msg); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
