TITLE: 35 Math Libraries / FFP Floating Point Data Format

35 Math Libraries / FFP Floating Point Data Format ]" border=0> FFP floating-point variables are defined within C by the float or FLOAT directive. In assembly language they are simply defined by a DC.L/DS.L statement. All FFP floating-point variables are defined as 32-bit entities (longwords) with the following format: _____________________________________________ | | | MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM EEEEEEE | | 31 23 15 7 | |_____________________________________________| The mantissa is considered to be a binary fixed-point fraction; except for 0, it is always normalized (the mantissa is shifted over and the exponent adjusted, so that the mantissa has a 1 bit in its highest position). Thus, it represents a value of less than 1 but greater than or equal to 1/2. The sign bit is reset (0) for a positive value and set (1) for a negative value. The exponent is the power of two needed to correctly position the mantissa to reflect the number's true arithmetic value. It is held in excess-64 notation, which means that the two's-complement values are adjusted upward by 64, thus changing $40 (-64) through $3F (+63) to $00 through $7F. This facilitates comparisons among floating-point values. The value of 0 is defined as all 32 bits being 0s. The sign, exponent, and mantissa are entirely cleared. Thus, 0s are always treated as positive. The range allowed by this format is as follows: DECIMAL: 9.22337177 * 10^18 > +VALUE > 5.42101070 * 10^-20 -9.22337177 * 10^18 +VALUE > .800000 * 2^-63 -.FFFFFF * 2^63 [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
