TITLE: 28 / Using Virtual Sprites / Specifying the Colors of a VSprite

28 / Using Virtual Sprites / Specifying the Colors of a VSprite ]" border=0> The system software provides a great deal of versatility in the choice of colors for Virtual Sprites. Each VSprite has its own set of three colors, pointed to by SprColors , which the system jams into the display's Copper list as needed. SprColors points to the first of three 16-bit values. The first value represents the color used for the VSprite bits that select color 1, the second value is color 2, and the third value is color 3. When the system assigns a hardware sprite to carry the VSprite's image, it jams these color values into the Copper list (the intermediate Copper list, not the color table), so that the View 's colors will be correct for this VSprite at the time the VSprite is displayed. It doesn't jam the original palette's colors back after the VSprite is done. If there is another VSprite later, that VSprite's colors will get jammed; if there is not another VSprite, the colors will remain the same until the next ViewPort 's colors get loaded. If the SprColors pointer is set to NULL, that VSprite does not generate a color-change instruction stream for the Copper. Instead, the VSprite appears drawn in whatever color set that the hardware sprite happens to have in it already. Since the registers are initially loaded with the colors from the ViewPort 's ColorMap , if all VSprites have NULL SprColors , they will appear in the ViewPort's colors. To continue our example, a set of colors can be declared and the VSprite colors set with the following statements: WORD mySpriteColors[] = { 0x0000, 0x00f0, 0x0f00 }; /* Declare colors statically */ myVSprite.SprColors = mySpriteColors; /* Assign colors to VSprite */ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
