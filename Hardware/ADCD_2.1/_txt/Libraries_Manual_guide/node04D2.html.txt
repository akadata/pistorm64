TITLE: B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_DRAW

B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_DRAW ]" border=0> This method tells an image object to draw itself. Applications should not call this method directly, instead use the intuition.library function DrawImageState() . The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. The IM_DRAW method uses a custom message structure: struct impDraw { ULONG MethodID; /* IM_DRAW */ struct RastPort *imp_RPort; /* RastPort to render into */ struct { /* X and Y offset relative to */ WORD X; /* the image's IA_Left and */ WORD Y; /* IA_Top attributes */ } imp_Offset; ULONG imp_State; /* Visual state of image */ struct DrawInfo *imp_DrInfo; /* describing rendering area */ }; n The imp_State field contains the visual state to render the image. The visual states (defined in imageclass.h >) are: IDS_NORMAL Render using normal imagery. This is the only kind of imagery available to non-Boopsi images. IDS_SELECTED Render using "selected" imagery. "Selected" refers to the state of a gadget's imagery when it is the selected gadget. IDS_DISABLED Render using "disabled" imagery. "Disabled" refers to the state of a gadget's imagery when it is disabled. Typically, a disabled image has a ghosting pattern on top of it. IDS_INACTIVENORMAL This is a special version of IDS_NORMAL for a "normal" image that is in the border of an inactive window. IDS_INACTIVESELECTED This is a special version of IDS_SELECTED for a "selected" image that is in the border of an inactive window. IDS_INACTIVEDISABLED This is a special version of IDS_DISABLED for a "disabled" image that is in the border of an inactive window. IDS_BUSY Render using "busy" imagery as if the object was the image of a gadget in a busy state. The busy gadget state is not yet supported by Intuition. IDS_INDETERMINATE Render using "indeterminate" imagery as if the object was the image of a gadget in an indeterminate state. The indeterminate gadget state is not yet supported by Intuition. Most image objects do not have different visual states for each possible imp_State. See the imageclass entries in this index for more details. When setting the pens to render an image, use the values from the imp_DrInfo->dri_Pens pen array (Note that it is possible for imp_DrInfo to be NULL). The possible pen values are defined in screens.h >. See the " Intuition Screens " chapter of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries for more information on the pen array.
