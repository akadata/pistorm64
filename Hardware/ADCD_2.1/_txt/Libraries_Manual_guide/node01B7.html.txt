8 / Graphic Objects / Displaying Images, Borders and IntuiText ]" border=0> Images, Borders and IntuiText objects may be directly or indirectly rendered into the display by the application. The application can draw these objects directly into windows or screens by using one of the functions DrawImage() , DrawBorder() or PrintIText() . The application supplies the appropriate pointer to a Border , Image or IntuiText structure as an argument to the function, as well as position information and a pointer to the correct RastPort . These rendering functions are discussed in more detail below. The application can also draw these objects indirectly by attaching them to a menu, gadget or requester. As Intuition places these elements on the display, it also renders the associated graphics. The Requester , Gadget , and MenuItem structures contain one or more fields reserved for rendering information. See the specific chapters on these items for information on attaching graphical objects to them. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
