TITLE: 1 / Programming in the Amiga Environment / The Custom Chips

1 / Programming in the Amiga Environment / The Custom Chips ]" border=0> The most important feature of the Amiga's hardware design is the set of custom chips that perform specialized tasks independently of the CPU. Each of the custom chips (named Paula, Agnus, and Denise) is dedicated to a particular job: Paula (8364) Audio, floppy disk, serial, interrupts Agnus (8361/8370/8372) Copper (video coprocessor), blitter, DMA control Denise (8362) Color registers, color DACs (Digital to Analog Converters) and sprites The custom chips can perform work independently of the CPU because they have DMA, or Direct Memory Access, capability. DMA means the custom chips can access special areas of memory by themselves without any CPU involvement. (On computer systems without DMA, the CPU must do some or all of the memory handling for support chips.) The Amiga's custom chips make multitasking especially effective because they can handle things like rendering graphics and playing sound independently, giving the CPU more time to handle the overhead of task-switching and other important jobs.
