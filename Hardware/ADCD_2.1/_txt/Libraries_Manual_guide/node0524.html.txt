B Boopsi Class Reference / frbuttonclass ]" border=0> Class: frbuttonclass Superclass: buttongclass Include File: gadgetclass.h > This is a special class of button gadget that puts a Boopsi framing image around some other display element. This display element can be one of three things: plain text from the GA_Text attribute, an IntuiText from the GA_IntuiText attribute, or an Image from the GA_LabelImage attribute. The user activates the gadget by clicking within the bounds of the gadget's framing image, which it gets from the GA_Image attribute. Usually the framing image is an instance of an image class that supports the IM_FRAMEBOX method (like frameiclass ). If the framing image supports the IM_FRAMEBOX method, the frbuttonclass object centers the frame image around the display element. See the imageclass description of IM_FRAMEBOX for more information.
