TITLE: 4 / Communicating with Intuition / The Console Device

4 / Communicating with Intuition / The Console Device ]" border=0> An alternative to the message system used by the IDCMP is the console device. The console device gives your application input data translated to ASCII characters or ANSI escape sequences. Raw (untranslated) input is also available through the console device as ANSI escape sequences. The console device also provides for convenient output of control codes and non-proportional (mono-spaced) text to the window. Output is character based, and includes capabilities such as automatic line wrapping and scrolling. The console device automatically formats and interprets the output stream. Output is kept within the window boundaries automatically so the application need not worry about overwriting the border (no GimmeZeroZero window required). The console device must be opened by the application before it is used. See the chapter entitled " Intuition Input and Output Methods " or refer to the " Console Device " chapter of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices for more information about using the console device with your Intuition windows.
