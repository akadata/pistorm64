4 Intuition Windows / About Windows ]" border=0> Windows are rectangular display areas that open on screens. The window acts as a virtual terminal allowing a program to interact with the user as if it had the entire display all to itself. Each window opens on a specific screen and takes certain characteristics, such as resolution, colors and display attributes, from that screen. These values cannot be adjusted on a window by window basis. Other window characteristics such as the text font are inherited from the screen but can be changed. An application may open several windows at the same time on a single screen. The Workbench and other public (shareable) screens allow windows opened by different applications to coexist on the same screen. Windows are moveable and can be positioned anywhere within the screen on which they exist. Windows may also have a title and borders containing various gadgets for controlling the window.
