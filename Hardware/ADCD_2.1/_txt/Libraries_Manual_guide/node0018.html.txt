TITLE: 1 / / The Custom Chips / Two Kinds of Memory

1 / / The Custom Chips / Two Kinds of Memory ]" border=0> To keep the Amiga running efficiently, the Amiga has two memory buses and two kinds of memory. Chip memory is memory that both the CPU and custom chips can access. Fast memory is memory that only the CPU (and certain expansion cards) can access. Since Chip memory is shared, CPU access may be slowed down if the custom chips are doing heavy-duty processing. CPU access to Fast memory is never slowed down by contention with the custom chips. The distinction between Chip memory and Fast memory is very important for Amiga programmers to keep in mind because any data accessed directly by the custom chips such as video display data, audio data or sprite data must be in Chip memory. _________________________________________________________________ | | | What Every Amiga Programmer Should Know: | | ---------------------------------------- | | The Amiga has two kinds of memory: Chip memory and Fast memory. | | Use the right kind. | |_________________________________________________________________| [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
