B / rootclass / New Methods: OM_SET ]" border=0> This method tells an object to set one or more of its attributes. Applications should not call this method directly. Instead, use the intuition.library functions SetAttrs() and SetGadgetAttrs() to call this method. The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. However, in general, when implementing the OM_SET method, if setting an object attribute causes some sort of visual state change, the OM_SET method should return a value greater than zero. If changing an attribute does not affect the visual state, OM_SET should return zero. This method uses a custom message (defined in classusr.h >): struct opSet { ULONG MethodID; /* OM_SET */ struct TagItem *ops_AttrList; /* tag list of attributes to set*/ struct GadgetInfo *ops_GInfo; }; The ops_AttrList field contains a pointer to a tag list of attribute/value pairs. These pairs contain the IDs and the new values of the attributes to set. The dispatcher has to look through this list (see docs for the utility.library NextTagItem() function) for attributes its class recognizes and set the attribute's value accordingly. The dispatcher should let its superclass handle any attributes it does not recognize. If the object is a gadget, the ops_GInfo field contains a pointer to a GadgetInfo structure. Otherwise, the value in ops_GInfo is undefined. Intuition use the GadgetInfo structure to pass display information to gadgets. See the gadgetclass methods for more details.
