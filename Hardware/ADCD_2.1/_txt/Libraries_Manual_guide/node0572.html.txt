E / Release 2 Changes That Can Affect Compatibility / CLI/Shell ]" border=0> * Many more commands are now built-in (no longer in C:). This can break installation scripts that copy C:commandname, and programs that try to Lock() or Open() C:commandname to check for the command's existence. * The limit of 20 CLI processes is gone and the DOSBase CLI table has changed to accommodate this. Under V36 and higher, you should use new 2.0 functions rather than accessing the CLI table directly. * Shell windows now have close gadgets. The EOF character is passed for the close gadget of a Shell. This is -1L with CON: getchar(), and the Close Gadget raw event ESC seq with RAW:. * Shells now use the simple-refresh character-mapped console. * By default, CON: now opens SIMPLE_REFRESH windows using the V36/V37 console character mapped mode. Because of some differences between character mapped consoles, and SMART_REFRESH non-mapped consoles, this may cause incompatibilities with some applications. For example, the Amiga private sequences to set left/top offset, and set line/page length behave differently in character mapped console windows. The only known work-around is to recompile asking for a CON: (or RAW:) window using the SMART flag. * Simple refresh/character mapped console windows now support highlighting and copying text with the mouse. This feature, as well as pasting text should be transparent to programs which use CON: for console input, and output. Pasted text will appear in your input stream as if the user had typed it. * While CONCLIP (see s:startup-sequence) is running, programs may receive " 0 v" in their input stream indicating the user wants to paste text from the clipboard. This shouldn't cause any problems for programs which parse correctly (however we know that it does; the most common problems are outputting the sequence, or confusing it with another sequence like that for FKEY 1 which is " 0~"). * The console.device now renders a ghosted cursor in inactive console windows (both SMART_REFRESH , and SIMPLE_REFRESH with character maps). Therefore, rendering over the console's cursor with graphics.library calls can trash the cursor; if you must do this, first turn off the cursor. * Some degree of unofficial support has been put in for programs which use SMART_REFRESH console windows, and use graphics.library calls mixed with console.device sequences to scroll, draw text, clear, etc. This is not supported in SIMPLE_REFRESH windows with character maps, and is strongly discouraged in all cases. * Closing an Intuition window before closing the attached console.device will now crash or hang the machine. * Under 1.2 and 1.3, vacated portions of a console window (e.g., areas vacated because of a clear, or a scroll) were filled in with the character cell color. As of V36 this is no longer true, vacated areas are filled in with the global background color which can be set using the SGR sequence " [>##m" where ## is a value between 0-7. In order to set the background color under Release 2, send the SGR to set background color, and a form feed to clear the screen. * Note that SIMPLE_REFRESH character mapped consoles are immediately redrawn with the global background color when changed--this is not possible with SMART_REFRESH windows.
