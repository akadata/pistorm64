33 / Context Functions / Storing LCIs ]" border=0> Once you've created and initialized an LCI , you'll want to attach it to a ContextNode . Though a ContextNode can have many LCIs, a given LCI can be linked to only one ContextNode. Once linked, an LCI cannot be removed from a ContextNode (this may change in the future). Storing an LCI in a ContextNode is done with the functions StoreLocalItem() and StoreItemInContext(). StoreLocalItem() StoreItemInContext() FindLocalItem() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
