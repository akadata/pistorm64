33 / / Custom Stream Handlers / Inside a Custom Stream Handler ]" border=0> When the library calls your stream handler, you'll be passed a pointer to the Hook structure (hook in the example used here), a pointer to the IFFHandle (iff), and a pointer to an IFFStreamCmd structure (actionpkt). Your stream pointer may be found in iff-> iff_Stream where you previously stored it. The IFFStreamCmd (actionpkt) will describe the action that IFFParse needs you to perform on your stream: /* Custom stream handler is passed struct IFFStreamCmd *actionpkt */ struct IFFStreamCmd { LONG sc_Command; /* Operation to be performed (IFFCMD_) */ APTR sc_Buf; /* Pointer to data buffer */ LONG sc_NBytes; /* Number of bytes to be affected */ }; /* Possible call-back command values. (Using 0 as the value for * IFFCMD_INIT was, in retrospect, probably a bad idea.) */ #define IFFCMD_INIT 0 /* Prepare the stream for a session */ #define IFFCMD_CLEANUP 1 /* Terminate stream session */ #define IFFCMD_READ 2 /* Read bytes from stream */ #define IFFCMD_WRITE 3 /* Write bytes to stream */ #define IFFCMD_SEEK 4 /* Seek on stream */ #define IFFCMD_ENTRY 5 /* You just entered a new context */ #define IFFCMD_EXIT 6 /* You're about to leave a context */ #define IFFCMD_PURGELCI 7 /* Purge a LocalContextItem */ Your custom stream handler should perform the requested action on your custom stream, and then return 0 for success or an IFFParse error if an error occurred. The following code demonstrates a sample stream handler for a stream which was opened with a compiler's fopen() buffered file I/O function: static LONG mystreamhandler ( struct Hook *hook, struct IFFHandle *iff, struct IFFStreamCmd *actionpkt ) { register FILE *stream; register LONG nbytes, error; register UBYTE *buf; stream = (FILE *) iff->iff_Stream; /* get stream pointer */ nbytes = actionpkt->sc_NBytes; /* length for command */ buf = (UBYTE *) actionpkt->sc_Buf; /* buffer for the command */ /* Now perform the action specified by the actionpkt->sc_Command */ switch (actionpkt->sc_Command) { case IFFCMD_READ: /* * IFFCMD_READ means read sc_NBytes from the stream and place * it in the memory pointed to by sc_Buf. Be aware that * sc_NBytes may be larger than can be contained in an int. * This is important if you plan on recompiling this for * 16-bit ints, since fread() takes int arguments. * * Any error code returned will be remapped by IFFParse into * IFFERR_READ. */ error = (fread (buf, 1, nbytes, stream) != nbytes); break; case IFFCMD_WRITE: /* * IFFCMD_WRITE is analogous to IFFCMD_READ. * * Any error code returned will be remapped by IFFParse into * IFFERR_WRITE. */ error = (fwrite (buf, 1, nbytes, stream) != nbytes); break; case IFFCMD_SEEK: /* * IFFCMD_SEEK asks that you performs a seek relative to the * current position. sc_NBytes is a signed number, * indicating seek direction (positive for forward, negative * for backward). sc_Buf has no meaning here. * * Any error code returned will be remapped by IFFParse into * IFFERR_SEEK. */ error = (fseek (stream, nbytes, 1) == -1); break; case IFFCMD_INIT: /* * IFFCMD_INIT means to prepare your stream for reading. * This is used for certain streams that can't be read * immediately upon opening, and need further preparation. * This operation is allowed to fail; the error code placed * in D0 will be returned directly to the client. * * An example of such a stream is the clipboard. The * clipboard.device requires you to set the io_ClipID and * io_Offset to zero before starting a read. You would * perform such a sequence here. (Stdio files need no such * preparation, so we simply return zero for success.) */ case IFFCMD_CLEANUP: /* * IFFCMD_CLEANUP means to terminate the transaction with * the associated stream. This is used for streams that * can't simply be closed. This operation is not allowed to * fail; any error returned will be ignored. * * An example of such a stream is (surprise!) the clipboard. * It requires you to explicitly end reads by CMD_READing * past the end of a clip, and end writes by sending a * CMD_UPDATE. You would perform such a sequence here. * (Again, stdio needs no such sequence.) */ error = 0; break; } return (error); } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
