27 / / About ECS / Determining Chip Versions ]" border=0> It is possible to ascertain whether the ECS chips are in the machine at run time by looking in the ChipRevBits0 field of the GfxBase structure. If this field contains the flag for the chip you are interested in (as defined in the gfxbase.h > include file), then that chip is present. For example, if the C statement ( GfxBase ->ChipRevBits0 & GFXF_HR_AGNUS) evaluates to non-zero, then the machine contains the ECS version of the Agnus chip and has advanced features such as the ability to handle larger rasters. Older Agnus chips were capable of handling rasters up to 1,024 by 1,024 pixels. The ECS Agnus can handle rasters up to 16,384 by 16,384 pixels. If ( GfxBase ->ChipRevBits0 & GFXF_HR_DENISE) is non-zero, then the ECS version of the Denise chip is present. Having both the ECS Agnus and ECS Denise present allows for the special SuperHires, VGA and Productivity display modes available in Release 2. For more information on ECS and the custom chips, refer to the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
