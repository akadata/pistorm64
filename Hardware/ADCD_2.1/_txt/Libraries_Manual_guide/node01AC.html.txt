TITLE: 7 Intuition Requesters and Alerts / Easy Requesters

7 Intuition Requesters and Alerts / Easy Requesters ]" border=0> EasyRequest() provides a simple way to make a requester that allows the user to select one of a limited number of choices. (A similar function, AutoRequest() , is also available but is not as flexible or as powerful. See the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs for more information.) Figure 7-2: A Simple Requester Made with EasyRequest() The program supplies the text for the body of the requester, text for each of the possible options, an optional title for the window, and other arguments. The body text can consist of one or more lines with lines separated by the linefeed character. Each option for an easy requester is displayed as a simple button gadget positioned beneath the body text you specify. The layout of the requester, its text and buttons, is done automatically and is font sensitive. The screen font ( Screen.Font ) is used for all text in the requester. Typically, easy requesters have one selection indicating a positive action and one selection indicating a negative action. The text used for the positive action might be "OK", "Yes," "True," "Retry," or similar responses. Likewise, the text used for the negative action might be "No," "False," "Cancel," and so on. The negative choice should always be the rightmost or final choice and will return a zero if selected. When EasyRequest() is called, Intuition will build the requester, display it, and wait for user response. LONG EasyRequest( struct Window *window, struct EasyStruct *easyStruct, ULONG *idcmpPtr, APTR arg1, ... ); LONG EasyRequestArgs( struct Window *window, struct EasyStruct *easyStruct, ULONG *idcmpPtr, APTR args ); The window argument is a pointer to the reference window. The requester will be displayed on the same screen that the reference window is on and also takes its title from the reference window, if not otherwise specified. This argument can be NULL, which means the requester is to appear on the Workbench screen, or the default public screen, if defined. The easyStruct argument is a pointer to an EasyStruct structure which defines the setup and the text of this easy requester (described below). The idcmpPtr argument is a pointer to a ULONG containing the IDCMP flags for the event that you want to terminate this requester. If such an event occurs the requester is terminated (with a result of -1) and the ULONG that idcmpPtr points to will contain the actual class of the event message. This feature allows external events to satisfy the request, such as the user inserting a disk in the disk drive. This argument can be set to NULL for no automatic termination. The gadget and body text for an easy requester is specified in an EasyStruct structure (see below). Body text can be specified using a printf() -style format string that also accepts variables as part of the text. If variables are specified in the requester text, their value is taken from the args (or arg1,...) parameters shown in the prototypes above. EasyRequestArgs() takes a pointer to an array of pointers to arguments, while EasyRequest() has a varargs interface and takes individual arguments as part of the function call. The types of these arguments are specified in the format strings of the EasyStruct structure. Arguments for es_GadgetFormat follow arguments for es_TextFormat . The EasyRequest() functions return an integer from 0 to n - 1, where n is the number of choices specified for the requester. The numbering from left-to-right is: 1, 2, ..., n - 1, 0. This is for compatibility with AutoRequest() which returns FALSE for the rightmost gadget. The function will return -1 if it receives an IDCMP event that matches one of the termination events specified in the idcmpPtr argument. Turn Off the Verify Messages. ----------------------------- Use ModifyIDCMP() to turn off all verify messages (such as MENUVERIFY ) before calling EasyRequest() or AutoRequest() . Neglecting to do so can cause situations where Intuition is waiting for the return of a message that the application program cannot receive because its input is shut off while the requester is up. If Intuition finds itself in a deadlock state, the verify function will timeout and will be automatically replied.
