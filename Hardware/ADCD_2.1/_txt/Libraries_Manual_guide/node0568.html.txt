E / Release 2 Changes That Can Affect Compatibility / Timer Device ]" border=0> * The most common mistake programmers make with timer.device is to send off a particular timerequest before the previous use of that timerequest has completed. Use IO_Torture to catch this. * IO_QUICK requests may be deferred and be replied as documented. * VBLANK timer requests, as documented, now wait at least as long as the full number of VBlanks you asked for. Previously, a partial vertical blank could count towards your requested number. The new behavior is more correct and matches the docs, but it can cause VBlank requests to now take up to 1 VBlank longer under 2.0 as compared to 1.3. For example, a 1/10 second request, may take 6-7 Vblanks instead of 5-6 VBlanks, or about 15% longer. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
