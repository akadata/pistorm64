TITLE: 29 Graphics Library and Text / But What About Color Fonts?

29 Graphics Library and Text / But What About Color Fonts? ]" border=0> When the Amiga loads a color font, it has to account for more information than will fit into the TextFont structures. For color fonts, the Amiga uses a superset of the TextFont structure called the ColorTextFont structure (defined in text.h >): struct ColorTextFont { struct TextFont ctf_TF; UWORD ctf_Flags; /* extended flags */ UBYTE ctf_Depth; /* number of bit planes */ UBYTE ctf_FgColor; /* color that is remapped to FgPen */ UBYTE ctf_Low; /* lowest color represented here */ UBYTE ctf_High; /* highest color represented here */ UBYTE ctf_PlanePick; /* PlanePick ala Images */ UBYTE ctf_PlaneOnOff; /* PlaneOnOff ala Images */ struct ColorFontColors *ctf_ColorFontColors; /* colors for font */ APTR ctf_CharData[8]; /* pointers to bit planes ala tf_CharData */ }; The ctf_TF field is the TextFont structure described in the previous section. There are two minor differences between the data stored in a color font's TextFont structure and an ordinary TextFont structure. The first is that the color font's TextFont.tf_Style field has the FSF_COLORFONT bit set. The other difference is that the bitmap that TextFont.tf_CharData points to can be a multi-plane bitmap. The ctf_Flags field is a bitfield that supports the following flags: CT_COLORFONT The color map for this font contains colors specified by the designer. CT_GREYFONT The colors for this font describe evenly stepped gray shades from low to high. The ctf_Depth field contains the bitplane depth of this font's bitmap. The ctf_FgColor contains the color that will be dynamically remapped during output by changing ctf_FgColor to RastPort.FgPen . This field allows a ColorTextFont to contain color outlines, shadows, etc. while also containing a predominant color that can be changed by the user. If the font does not have a predominant color, ctf_FgColor is 0xFF. For example, given a color font that has a blue and red outline and a white center, the person designing the font can set ctf_FgColor equal to white. Then when the font is used in a paint package that supports color fonts, the white will change to the current foreground color. The fields ctf_Low and ctf_High contain the lowest and highest color values in the ColorTextFont. For example, a four bitplane color font can have sixteen colors, but the font may use only nine of those colors, thus ctf_Low=0 and ctf_High=8. The most important use of these colors is for defining the boundaries of a gray scale font. If the font uses less than the total number of colors around but needs white as the lowest and black as the highest level of gray, the boundaries would have to be defined in order for the font to be rendered correctly. Defaults for these values should be the lowest and the highest values for the given number of bitplanes. The ctf_PlanePick and ctf_PlaneOnOff contain information for saving space in memory for some types of ColorTextFont structures. The ctf_PlanePick field contains information about where each plane of data will be rendered in a given bitmap. The ctf_PlaneOnOff field contains information about planes that are not used to render a plane of font data. If ctf_PlaneOnOff contains a zero bit for a given plane, that bitplane is cleared. If ctf_PlaneOnOff contains a set bit for a given plane, that bitplane is filled. For more information on how the ctf_PlaneOnOff and ctf_PlanePick fields work see the " Specifying the Colors of a Bob " section of the "Graphics Sprites, Bobs and Animation" chapter of this book. The ctf_ColorFontColors field contains a pointer to a ColorFontColors structure: struct ColorFontColors { UWORD cfc_Reserved; /* *must* be zero */ UWORD cfc_Count; /* number of entries in cfc_ColorTable */ UWORD *cfc_ColorTable; /* 4 bit per component color map packed xRGB */ }; Which specifies the colors used by this font. The ColorFontColors cfc_Count field contains the number of colors defined in this structure. Each color is defined as a single, UWORD entry in the cfc_ColorTable. For each entry in cfc_ColorTable, the lowest four bits make up the blue element, the next four bits the green element, the next four bits the red element, and the upper four bits should be masked out. The ctf_CharData[] fields is an array of pointers to each of the bitplanes of the color font data. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
