TITLE: 15 / / Kinds of GadTools Gadgets / Text-Entry and Number-Entry Gadgets

15 / / Kinds of GadTools Gadgets / Text-Entry and Number-Entry Gadgets ]" border=0> Text-entry (STRING_KIND) and number-entry (INTEGER_KIND) gadgets are fairly typical Intuition string gadgets. The typing area is contained by a border which is a raised ridge. Text-entry gadgets accept the following tags: GTST_String (STRPTR) A pointer to the string to be placed into the text-entry gadget buffer or NULL to get an empty text-entry gadget. The string itself is actually copied into the gadget's buffer. The default is NULL. (Create and set.) GTST_MaxChars (UWORD) The maximum number of characters that the text-entry gadget should hold. The string buffer that gets created for the gadget will actually be one bigger than this number, in order to hold the trailing NULL. The default is 64. (Create only.) Number-entry gadgets accept the following tags: GTIN_Number (ULONG) The number to be placed into the number-entry gadget. The default is zero. (Create and set.) GTIN_MaxChars (UWORD) The maximum number of digits that the number-entry gadget should hold. The string buffer that gets created for the gadget will actually be one bigger than this, in order to hold the trailing NULL. The default is 10. (Create only.) Both text-entry and number-entry gadgets, which are collectively called string gadgets, accept these common tags: STRINGA_Justification This attribute controls the placement of the string or number within its box and can be one of GACT_STRINGLEFT , GACT_STRINGRIGHT or GACT_STRINGCENTER . The default is GACT_STRINGLEFT. (Create only.) STRINGA_ReplaceMode (BOOL) Set STRINGA_ReplaceMode to TRUE to get a string gadget which is in replace-mode, as opposed to auto-insert mode. (Create only.) GA_Disabled (BOOL) Set this attribute to TRUE to disable the string gadget, otherwise to FALSE. The default is FALSE. (Create and set.) STRINGA_ExitHelp (BOOL) (New for V37, ignored under V36). Set this attribute to TRUE if the application wants to hear the Help key from within this string gadget. This feature allows the program to hear the press of the Help key in all cases. If TRUE, pressing the help key while this gadget is active will terminate the gadget and send a message. The program will receive an IDCMP_GADGETUP message having a Code value of 0x5F, the rawkey code for Help. Typically, the program will want to reactivate the gadget after performing the help-display. The default is FALSE. (Create only.) GA_TabCycle (BOOL) (New for V37, ignored under V36). If the user types Tab or Shift Tab into a GA_TabCycle gadget, Intuition will activate the next or previous such gadget in sequence. This gives the user easy keyboard control over which text-entry or number-entry gadget is active. Tab moves to the next GA_TabCycle gadget in the gadget list and Shift Tab moves to the previous one. When the user presses Tab or Shift Tab, Intuition will deactivate the gadget and send this program an IDCMP_GADGETUP message with the code field set to 0x09, the ASCII value for a tab. Intuition will then activate the next indicated gadget. Check the shift bits of the qualifier field to learn if Shift Tab was typed. The ordering of the gadgets may only be controlled by the order in which they were added to the window. For special cases, for example, if there is only one string gadget in the window, this feature can be suppressed by specifying the tagitem pair {GA_TabCycle, FALSE}. The default is TRUE. (Create only.) GTST_EditHook (struct Hook *) (New for V37, ignored under V36). Pointer to a custom editing hook for this string or integer gadget. See the " Intuition Gadgets " chapter for more information on string gadget edit-hooks. As with all Intuition string gadgets, the program will receive an IDCMP_GADGETUP message only when the user presses Enter, Return, Help, Tab or Shift Tab while typing in the gadget. Note that, like Intuition string gadgets, the program will not hear anything if the user deactivates the string gadget by clicking elsewhere. Therefore, it is a good idea to always check the string gadget's buffer before using its contents, instead of just tracking its value as IDCMP_GADGETUP messages are received for this gadget. Be sure the code is designed so that nothing drastic happens, like closing a requester or opening a file, if the IDCMP_GADGETUP message has a non-zero Code field; the program will want to handle the Tab and Help cases intelligently. To read the string gadget's buffer, look at the Gadget 's StringInfo Buffer : ((struct StringInfo *)gad->SpecialInfo)->Buffer To determine the value of an integer gadget, look at the Gadget 's StringInfo LongInt in the same way. Always use the GTST_String or GTIN_Number tags to set these values. Never write to the StringInfo->Buffer or StringInfo->LongInt fields directly. GadTools string and integer gadgets do not directly support the GA_Immediate property (which would cause Intuition to send an IDCMP_GADGETDOWN event when such a gadget is first selected). However, this property can be very important. Therefore, the following technique can be used to enable this property. Warning: -------- Note that the technique shown here relies on directly setting flags in a GadTools gadget; this is not normally allowed since it hinders future compatibility. Do not attempt to change other flags or properties of GadTools gadgets except through the defined interfaces of CreateGadgetA() and GT_SetGadgetAttrsA() . Directly modifying flags or properties is legal only when officially sanctioned by Amiga, Inc.. To get the GA_Immediate property, pass the {GA_Immediate,TRUE} tag to CreateGadgetA() . Even though this tag is ignored for string and integer gadgets under V37, this will allow future versions of GadTools to learn of your request in the correct way. Then, under V37 only, set the GACT_IMMEDIATE flag in the gadget's Activation field: gad = CreateGadget( STRING_KIND, gad, &ng, /* string gadget tags go here */ GTST_..., /* Add this tag for future GadTools releases */ GA_Immediate, TRUE, ... TAG_DONE ); if ( ( gad ) && ( GadToolsBase->lib_Version == 37) ) { /* Under GadTools V37 only, set this attribute * directly. Do not set this attribute under * future versions of GadTools, or for gadgets * other than STRING_KIND or INTEGER_KIND. */ gad->Activation |= GACT_IMMEDIATE; } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
