TITLE: 9 / / Event Message Classes and Flags / Window Flags

9 / / Event Message Classes and Flags / Window Flags ]" border=0> IDCMP_NEWSIZE Intuition sends this message after the user has resized the window. After receiving this, the program can examine the size variables in the window structure to discover the new size of the window. The message is sent, even if the size of the window did not actually change. IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW This message is sent whenever the window needs refreshing. This flag makes sense only with windows that have a refresh type of WA_SimpleRefresh or WA_SmartRefresh . As a minimum, the application must call BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh() for the window after receiving an IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW event. Create the window with the WA_NoCareRefresh attribute if you do not want to manage these events. See the " Intuition Windows " chapter for details. Most of the graphics library calls used for display output are compatible with Intuition, with the exception of ScrollRaster(). Intuition will not send an IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW event when damage is caused to a window by ScrollRaster() . This may happen in a simple refresh window which is partially obscured by another window--the region that scrolls out from behind the front window will be damaged, but the window will receive no notification. Check the LAYERREFRESH bit in the Layer structure Flags field to see if damage did happen as a result of ScrollRaster(). IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY Set this flag if the program must complete some operation before the user sizes the window. When the user sizes the window, Intuition sends an IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY message to the application and then waits until the program replies before allowing the user to size the window. See the " Verification Functions " section below for some things to consider when using this flag. IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW and IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW Set these flags to discover when the window becomes activated or deactivated. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
