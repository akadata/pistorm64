TITLE: 27 / / / Mode Specification, Screen Interface

27 / / / Mode Specification, Screen Interface ]" border=0> Opening an Intuition screen in one of the new modes requires the specification of 32 bits of mode data. The NewScreen.ViewModes field is a UWORD (16 bits). Therefore, the new Release 2 function OpenScreenTags() must be used along with a SA_DisplayID tag which specifies the 32-bit ModeID. See the " Intuition Screens " chapter for more on this. The new display modes also introduce some complexity for applications that want to support "mode-sensitive" processing. If a program wishes to open a screen in the highest resolution that a user has available, there are many more cases to handle under Release 2. Therefore, it will become increasingly important to algorithmically layout a screen for correct, functional and aesthetic operation. All the information needed to be mode-flexible is available through the display database functions (explained below). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
