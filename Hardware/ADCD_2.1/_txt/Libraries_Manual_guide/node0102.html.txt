4 Intuition Windows / Basic Window Structures and Functions ]" border=0> This section introduces the basic data structures and functions an application uses to create an Intuition window. Intuition uses the Window data structure defined in intuition.h > to represent windows. Most of Intuition's window functions use this structure in some way. Other related structures used to create and operate windows are summarized in Table 4-1. Table 4-1: Data Structures Used with Intuition Windows Structure Name Description Defined in Include File -------------- ----------- ----------------------- Window Main Intuition structure that intuition.h > defines a window TagItem General purpose parameter tagitem.h > structure used to set up windows in V37 NewWindow Parameter structure used to intuition.h > create a window in V34 ExtNewWindow An extension to the NewWindow intuition.h > structure used in V37 for backward compatibility with older systems Layer A drawing rectangle that clip.h > clips graphic operations falling within its boundaries RastPort General purpose handle used rastport.h > for graphics library drawing operations. Intuition's window system relies on the layers library and graphics library to implement many of its features. The Window structure is closely related to the Layer structure defined in clip.h > and the RastPort structure defined in rastport.h >. The system uses these structures to store drawing state data. In general, applications don't have to worry about the internal details of these structures but use them instead as convenient handles, passing them as arguments to lower-level functions. See the " Layers Library " and " Graphics Primitives " chapters for more information.
