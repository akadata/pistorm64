3 / / Creating A New Custom Screen / A Custom Screen Example ]" border=0> There are so many tag options available with screens it can be a bit overwhelming. Before discussing more details, it may be helpful to look at a simple example. The code below opens a new, custom screen using the OpenScreenTags() call. The example uses just two tag items ( SA_Depth and SA_Pens ) which provide the minimum attributes needed to make a screen that uses the new 3D look of Intuition available in Release 2. (See the section on " DrawInfo and the 3D Look " below for more information.) newlookscreen.c The example above runs only under Release 2 (V36) and later versions of the OS. To make a custom screen that works under both Release 2 and earlier versions of the operating system, use the original OpenScreen() function. The NewScreen structure used with OpenScreen() has been extended with a tag list in V36 to form an ExtNewScreen . This is done by setting the NS_EXTENDED bit in the Type field of the NewScreen structure and adding a pointer to an array of tags to the end of the structure. The NS_EXTENDED bit is ignored in older versions of the operating system, so the tags can be transparently added to existing applications and the features will appear when executed in a system running V36 or greater. See the OpenScreen() Autodocs and the include file screens.h > for more information on NS_EXTENDED and the ExtNewScreen structure. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
