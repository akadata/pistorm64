32 / Expansion Board Drivers / ROM Based and Autoboot Drivers ]" border=0> Since 1.3, the system software supports the initialization of ROM drivers residing on expansion peripherals, including the ability for drivers to provide a DOS node which the system can boot from. This feature is known as Autoboot. Automatic boot from a ROM-equipped expansion board is accomplished before DOS is initialized. This facility makes it possible to automatically boot from a hard disk without any floppy disks inserted. Likewise, it is possible to automatically boot from any device which supports the ROM protocol, even allowing the initialization of a disk operating system other than the Amiga's dos.library. ROM-based drivers contain several special entry points that are called at different stages of system initialization. These three stages are known as DIAG, ROMTAG INIT and BOOT.
