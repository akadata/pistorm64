TITLE: 8 / Creating Borders / Border Structure Definition

8 / Creating Borders / Border Structure Definition ]" border=0> To use a border, the application must create one or more instances of the Border structure. Here is the specification: struct Border { WORD LeftEdge, TopEdge; UBYTE FrontPen, BackPen; UBYTE DrawMode; BYTE Count; WORD *XY; struct Border *NextBorder; }; Here is a brief description of the fields of the Border structure. LeftEdge, TopEdge These fields are used to determine the position of the Border relative to its base position (the base position is the upper left corner for requesters, menus, or gadgets and is specified in the call to DrawBorder() for windows and screens). FrontPen, BackPen These fields contain color registers numbers. FrontPen is the color used to draw the lines. BackPen is currently unused. DrawMode Set the DrawMode field to one of the following: JAM1 Use FrontPen to draw the line. COMPLEMENT Change the pixels within the lines to their complement color. Count Specify the number of data points used in this border. Each data point is described by two words of data in the XY array. XY A pointer to an array of coordinate pairs, one pair for each point. These coordinates are measured relative to the position of the border. NextBorder This field is a pointer to another instance of a Border structure. Set this field to NULL if this is the last Border structure in the linked list. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
