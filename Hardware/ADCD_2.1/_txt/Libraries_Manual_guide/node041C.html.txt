TITLE: 32 / / ROM Based and Autoboot Drivers / Events At DIAG Time

32 / / ROM Based and Autoboot Drivers / Events At DIAG Time ]" border=0> When your AUTOCONFIG hardware board is configured by the expansion initialization routine, its ExpansionRom structure is copied into the ExpansionRom subfield of a ConfigDev structure. This ConfigDev structure will be linked to the expansion.library's private list of configured boards. After the board is configured, the er_Type field of its ExpansionRom structure is checked. The DIAGVALID bit set declares that there is a valid DiagArea (a ROM/diagnostic area) on this board. If there is a valid DiagArea, expansion next tests the er_InitDiagVec vector in its copy of the ExpansionRom structure. This offset is added to the base address of the configured board; the resulting address points to the start of this board's DiagArea. struct ExpansionRom { UBYTE er_Type; /* }; Now expansion knows that there is a DiagArea , and knows where it is. struct DiagArea { UBYTE da_Config; /* }; /* da_Config definitions */ #define DAC_BUSWIDTH 0xC0 /* two bits for bus width */ #define DAC_NIBBLEWIDE 0x00 #define DAC_BYTEWIDE 0x40 /* invalid for 1.3 - see note below */ #define DAC_WORDWIDE 0x80 #define DAC_BOOTTIME 0x30 /* two bits for when to boot */ #define DAC_NEVER 0x00 /* obvious */ #define DAC_CONFIGTIME 0x10 /* call da_BootPoint when first configging the device */ #define DAC_BINDTIME 0x20 /* run when binding drivers to boards */ Next, expansion tests the first byte of the DiagArea structure to determine if the CONFIGTIME bit is set. If this bit is set, it checks the da_BootPoint offset vector to make sure that a valid bootstrap routine exists. If so, expansion copies da_Size bytes into RAM memory, starting at beginning of the DiagArea structure. The copy will include the DiagArea structure itself, and typically will also include the da_DiagPoint ROM/diagnostic routine, a Resident structure (romtag), a device driver (or at least the device initialization tables or structures which need patching), and the da_BootPoint routine. In addition, the BootNode and parameter packet for MakeDosNode() may be included in the copy area for Diag-time patching. Strings such as DOS and Exec device names, library names, and the romtag ID string may also be included in the copy area so that both position-independent ROM code and position-independent routines in the copy area may reference them PC relative. The copy will be made either nibblewise, or wordwise, according to the BUSWIDTH subfield of da_Config. Note that the da_BootPoint offset must be non-NULL, or else no copy will occur. (Note - under 1.3, DAC_BYTEWIDE is not supported. Byte wide ROMs must use DAC_NIBBLEWIDE and drivers must supply additional code to re-copy their DiagArea) The following illustrates an example Diag copy area, and specifies the various fields which should be coded as relative offsets for later patching by your DiagPoint routine. Example DiagArea Copy in RAM DiagStart: ; a struct DiagArea CCFF ; da_Config, da_Flags SIZE ; da_Size - coded as EndCopy-DiagStart DIAG ; da_DiagPoint - coded as DiagEntry-DiagStart BOOT ; da_BootPoint - coded as BootEntry-DiagStart NAME ; da_Name - coded as DevName-DiagStart 0000 ; da_Reserved01 - Above fields above are supposed 0000 ; da_Reserved02 to be relative. No patching needed Romtag: rrrr ; a struct Resident ("Romtag") ... RT_MATCHTAG, RT_ENDSKIP, RT_NAME and RT_IDSTRING ... addresses are coded relatively as label-DiagStart. ... The RT_INIT vector is coded as a relative offset ... from the start of the ROM. DiagEntry patches these. DevName: ssss..0 ; The name string for the exec device IdString: iiii..0 ; The ID string for the Romtag BootEntry: BBBB ; Boot-time code ... DiagEntry: DDDD ; Diag-time code (position independent) ... When called, performs patching of the relative- coded addresses which need to be absolute. OtherData: dddd ; Device node or structs/tables (patch names, vectors) bbbb ; BootNode (patch ln_Name and bn_DeviceNode) pppp ; MakeDosNode packet (patch dos and exec names) ssss ; other name, ID, and library name strings ... EndCopy: Now the ROM "image" exists in RAM memory. Expansion stores the ULONG address of that "image" in the UBYTES er_Reserved0c, 0d, 0e and 0f. The address is stored with the most significant byte in er_Reserved0c, the next to most significant byte in er_Reserved0d, the next to least significant byte in er_Reserved0e, and the least significant byte in er_Reserved0f - i.e., it is stored as a longword at the address er_Reserved0c. Expansion finally checks the da_DiagPoint offset vector, and if valid executes the ROM/diagnostic routine contained as part of the ROM "image". This diagnostic routine is responsible for patching the ROM image so that required absolute addresses are relocated to reflect the actual location of code and strings, as well as performing any diagnostic functions essential to the operation of its associated AUTOCONFIG board. The structures which require patching are located within the copy area so that they can be patched at this time. Patching is required because many of the structures involved require absolute pointers to such things as name strings and code, but the absolute locations of the board and the RAM copy area are not known when code the structures. The patching may be accomplished by coding pointers which require absolute addresses instead as relative offsets from either the start of the DiagArea structure, or the start of the board's ROM (depending on whether the final absolute pointer will point to a RAM or ROM location). The Diag routine is passed both the actual base address of the board, and the address of the Diag copy area in RAM. The routine can then patch the structures in the Diag copy area by adding the appropriate address to resolve each pointer. Example DiagArea and Diag patching routine: Diag.asm Your da_DiagPoint ROM/diagnostic routine should return a non-zero value to indicate success; otherwise the ROM "image" will be unloaded from memory, and its address will be replaced with NULL bytes in locations er_Reserved0c, 0d, 0e and 0f. Now that the ROM "image" has been copied into RAM, validated, and linked to board's ConfigDev structure, the expansion module is free to configure all other boards on the utility.library's private list of boards. It may help to see just how a card's ROM AUTOCONFIG information corresponds to the ExpansionRom structure. This chart shows the contents of on-card memory for a fictional expansion card. Note that the ExpansionRom.Flags field ($3F in addresses $08/$0A below) is shown interpreted in its inverted form of $3F. Once the value is uninverted to become $C0, you should use the #defines in configregs.h > to interpret it.
