TITLE: 31 Commodities Exchange Library / Controlling CxMessages

31 Commodities Exchange Library / Controlling CxMessages ]" border=0> A Custom CxObject has the power to directly manipulate the CxMessages that travel around the Commodities network. One way is to directly change values in the corresponding input event. Another way is to redirect (or dispose of) the CxMessages. void DivertCxMsg ( CxMsg *cxm, CxObj *headobj, CxObj *retobj ); void RouteCxMsg ( CxMsg *cxm, CxObj *co ); void DisposeCxMsg( CxMsg *cxm ); DivertCxMsg() and RouteCxMsg() dictate where the CxMessage will go next. Conceptually, DivertCxMsg() is analogous to a subroutine in a program; the CxMessage will travel down the personal list of a CxObject (headobj in the prototype) until it gets to the end of that list. It then returns and visits the CxObject that follows the return CxObject (the return CxObject in the prototype above is retobj). RouteCxMsg() is analogous to a goto in a program; it has no CxObject to return to. DisposeCxMsg() removes a CxMessage from the network and releases its resources. The translate CxObject uses this function to remove a CxMessage. The example Divert.c shows how to use DivertCxMsg() as well as a signal CxObject . divert.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
