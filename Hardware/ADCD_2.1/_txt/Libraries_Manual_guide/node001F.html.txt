1 / 1.3 Compatibility Issues / Design Decisions ]" border=0> The latest Amiga models, including all A3000's, are running Release 2 . But many older Amigas are still running 1.3 at this time. Depending on your application and your market, you may choose to require the Release 2 operating system as a minimum platform. This can be a reasonable requirement for vertical markets and professional applications. Release 2 can also be a reasonable requirement for new revisions of existing software products, since you could continue to ship the older 1.3-compatible release in the same package. If you have made the decision to require Release 2, then you are free to take advantage of all of the new libraries and features that Release 2 provides. Throughout this latest edition of the Amiga Technical Reference Series, features, functions and libraries that are new for Release 2 are usually indicated by (V36) or (V37) in the description of the feature. Such features are not available on Amiga models that are running 1.3 (V34) or earlier versions of the OS. Unconditional use of Release 2 functions will cause a program to fail when it is run on a machine with the 1.3 OS. It is very important to remember this when designing and writing your code. Developers of consumer-priced productivity, entertainment and utility software may not yet be ready to write applications that require Release 2 , but even these developers can enhance their products by taking advantage of Release 2 while remaining 1.3 compatible. There are three basic methods that will allow you to take advantage of enhanced Release 2 features while remaining 1.3 compatible: * Transparent Release 2 Extensions * Conditional Code * Compatible Libraries Transparent Release 2 Extensions Conditional Code ASL Requesters DOS System(), CreateNewProc(), and CON: Enhancements The Display Database ARexx [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
