5 Intuition Gadgets / Boolean Gadget Type ]" border=0> A boolean gadget gets yes/no or on/off responses from the user. To make a boolean gadget set the GadgetType field to GTYP_BOOLGADGET in the Gadget structure. Boolean gadgets come in two types: hit-select and toggle-select. Hit-select gadgets are only active while the user holds down the mouse select button. When the button is released, the gadget is unhighlighted. Action buttons, such as "OK" and "Cancel", are hit-select. Toggle-select gadgets become selected when the user clicks them. To "unselect" the gadget, the user has to click the gadget again. Switches, such as a checkbox, are toggle-select. Set the GACT_TOGGLESELECT flag in the Activation field of the Gadget structure to create a toggle-select gadget. The GFLG_SELECTED flag in Gadget structure Flags field determines the initial and current on/off selected state of a toggle-select gadget. If GFLG_SELECTED is set, the gadget will be highlighted. The application can set the GFLG_SELECTED flag before submitting the gadget to Intuition. The program may examine this flag at any time to determine the current state of this gadget. Try to make the imagery for toggle-select gadgets visually distinct from hit-select gadgets so that their operation can be determined by the user through visual inspection.
