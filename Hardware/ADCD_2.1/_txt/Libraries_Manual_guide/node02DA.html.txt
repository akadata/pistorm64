23 / List Structure / Node Initialization ]" border=0> Before linking a node into a list, certain fields may need initialization. Initialization consists of setting the ln_Type , ln_Pri , and ln_Name fields to their appropriate values (A MinNode structure does not have these fields). The successor and predecessor fields do not require initialization. The ln_Type field contains the data type of the node. This indicates to Exec (and other subsystems) the type, and hence the structure, of the content portion of the node (the extra data after the Node structure). The standard system types are defined in the nodes.h > include file. Some examples of standard system types are NT_TASK, NT_INTERRUPT, NT_DEVICE, and NT_MSGPORT. The ln_Pri field uses a signed numerical value ranging from +127 to -128 to indicate the priority of the node. Higher-priority nodes have greater values; for example, 127 is the highest priority, zero is nominal priority, and -128 is the lowest priority. Some Exec lists are kept sorted by priority order. In such lists, the highest-priority node is at the head of the list, and the lowest-priority node is at the tail of the list. Most Exec node types do not use a priority. In such cases, initialize the priority field to zero. The ln_Name field is a pointer to a NULL-terminated string of characters. Node names are used to find and identify list-bound objects (like public message ports and libraries), and to bind symbolic names to actual nodes. Names are also useful for debugging purposes, so it is a good idea to provide every node with a name. Take care to provide a valid name pointer; Exec does not copy name strings. This fragment initializes a Node called myInt, an instance of the Interrupt data structure introduced above. struct Interrupt interrupt; interrupt.is_Node.ln_Type = NT_INTERRUPT; interrupt.is_Node.ln_Pri = -10; interrupt.is_Node.ln_Name = "sample.interrupt"; [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
