TITLE: 27 / Drawing Routines / Performing Data Move Operations

27 / Drawing Routines / Performing Data Move Operations ]" border=0> The graphics library includes several routines that use the hardware blitter to handle the rectangularly organized data that you work with when doing raster-based graphics. These blitter routines do the following: * Clear an entire segment of memory * Set a raster to a specific color * Scroll a subrectangle of a raster * Draw a pattern "through a stencil" * Extract a pattern from a bit-packed array and draw it into a raster * Copy rectangular regions from one bitmap to another * Control and utilize the hardware-based data mover, the blitter The following sections cover these routines in detail. WARNING: -------- The graphics library rendering and data movement routines generally wait to get access to the blitter, start their blit, and then exit without waiting for the blit to finish. Therefore, you must WaitBlit() after a graphics rendering or data movement call if you intend to immediately deallocate, examine, or perform order-dependent processor operations on the memory used in the call.
