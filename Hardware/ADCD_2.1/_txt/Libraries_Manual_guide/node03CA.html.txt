28 / Animation with GELs / The AnimKey ]" border=0> The system uses one pointer, known as the AnimKey, to keep track of all the AnimOb s via their PrevOb and NextOb linkage fields. The AnimKey acts as the anchor for the list of AnimObs you are using and is initialized with code such as the following: struct AnimOb *animKey; InitAnimate(&animKey); /* Only do this once to initialize the AnimOb list */ As each new object is added (via AddAnimOb() ), it is linked in at the beginning of the list, so AnimKey will always point to the object most recently added to the list. To search forward through the list, start with the AnimKey and move forward on the NextOb link. Continue to move forward until the NextOb is NULL, indicating the end of the list. The PrevOb link will allow you to move back to a previous object. Set Up PrevOb and NextOb Correctly. ----------------------------------- It is important that the NextOb link of the last object is NULL, and that the PrevOb of the first object is NULL. In fact, the system expects the animation object lists to be exactly the way that they are described above. If they are not, the system will produce unexpected results. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
