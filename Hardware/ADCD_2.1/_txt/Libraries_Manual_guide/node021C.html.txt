12 / / The Boopsi Gadget Methods / GM_GOACTIVE/GM_HANDLEINPUT ]" border=0> If a gadget returns GMR_GADGETHIT , Intuition will send it a GM_GOACTIVE message (defined in gadgetclass.h >): struct gpInput /* Used by GM_GOACTIVE and GM_HANDLEINPUT */ { ULONG MethodID; struct GadgetInfo *gpi_GInfo; struct InputEvent *gpi_IEvent; /* The input event that triggered this method * (for GM_GOACTIVE, this can be NULL) */ LONG *gpi_Termination; /* For GADGETUP IntuiMessage.Code */ struct { WORD X; /* Mouse position relative to upper */ WORD Y; /* left corner of gadget (LeftEdge,TopEdge) */ } gpi_Mouse; }; The GM_GOACTIVE message gives a gadget the opportunity to become the active gadget. The active gadget is the gadget that is currently receiving user input. Under normal conditions, only one gadget can be the active gadget (it is possible to have more than one active gadget using a groupgclass object--See the Boopsi Class Reference in the Appendix B of this manual for more details). While a gadget is active, Intuition sends it GM_HANDLEINPUT messages. Each GM_HANDLEINPUT message corresponds to a single InputEvent structure. These InputEvents can be keyboard presses, timer events, mouse moves, or mouse button presses. The message's gpi_IEvent field points to this InputEvent structure. It's up to the GM_HANDLEINPUT method to interpret the meaning of these events and update the visual state of the gadget as the user manipulates the gadget. For example, the GM_HANDLEINPUT method of a prop gadget has to track mouse events to see where the user has moved the prop gadget's knob and update the gadget's imagery to reflect the new position of the knob. For the GM_GOACTIVE method, the gpi_IEvent field points to the struct InputEvent that triggered the GM_GOACTIVE message. Unlike the GM_HANDLEINPUT message, GM_GOACTIVE's gpi_IEvent can be NULL. If the GM_GOACTIVE message was triggered by a function like intuition.library's ActivateGadget() and not by a real InputEvent (like the user clicking the gadget), the gpi_IEvent field will be NULL. For gadgets that only want to become active as a direct result of a mouse click, this difference is important. For example, the prop gadget becomes active only when the user clicks on its knob. Because the only way the user can control the prop gadget is via the mouse, it does not make sense for anything but the mouse to activate the gadget. On the other hand, a string gadget doesn't care how it is activated because, as soon as it's active, it gets user input from the keyboard rather than the mouse. Not all gadgets can become active. Some gadgets cannot become active because they have been temporarily disabled (their Gadget.Flags GFLG_DISABLED bit is set). Other gadgets will not become active because they don't need to process input. For example, a toggle gadget won't become active because it only needs to process one input event, the mouse click that toggles the gadget (which it gets from the GM_GOACTIVE message). If a toggle gadget gets a GM_GOACTIVE message and its gpi_IEvent field is not NULL, it will toggle its state and refuse to "go active". The GM_GOACTIVE method has to take care of any visual state changes to a gadget that a GM_GOACTIVE message might trigger. For example, the toggle gadget in the previous paragraph has to take care of toggling its visual state from selected imagery to unselected imagery. If the gadget goes through a state change when it becomes the active gadget, (like when a string gadget positions its cursor) GM_GOACTIVE has to take care of this. The return values of both GM_GOACTIVE and GM_HANDLEINPUT tell Intuition whether or not the gadget wants to be active. A gadget's GM_GOACTIVE method returns GMR_MEACTIVE (defined in gadgetclass.h >) if it wants to become the active gadget. A gadget's GM_HANDLEINPUT method returns GMR_MEACTIVE if it wants to remain the active gadget. If a gadget either does not want to become or remain the active gadget, it returns one of the "go inactive" return values: GMR_NOREUSE Tells Intuition to throw away the gpInput.gpi_IEvent InputEvent . GMR_REUSE Tells Intuition to process the gpInput.gpi_IEvent InputEvent . GMR_NEXTACTIVE Tells Intuition to throw away the gpInput.gpi_IEvent InputEvent and activate the next GFLG_TABCYCLE gadget. GMR_PREVACTIVE Tells Intuition to throw away the gpInput.gpi_IEvent InputEvent and activate the previous GFLG_TABCYCLE gadget. GMR_NOREUSE tells Intuition that the gadget does not want to be active and to throw away the InputEvent that triggered the message. For example, an active prop gadget returns GMR_NOREUSE when the user lets go of the left mouse button (thus letting go of the prop gadget's knob). For the GM_HANDLEINPUT method, a gadget can also return GMR_REUSE, which tells Intuition to reuse the InputEvent . For example, if the user clicks outside the active string gadget, that string gadget returns GMR_REUSE. Intuition can now process that mouse click, which can be over another gadget. Another case where a string gadget returns GMR_REUSE is when the user pushes the right mouse button (the menu button). The string gadget becomes inactive and the menu button InputEvent gets reused. Intuition sees this event and tries to pop up the menu bar. For the GM_GOACTIVE method, a gadget must not return GMR_REUSE. If a gadget gets a GM_GOACTIVE message from Intuition and the message has an gpi_IEvent, the message was triggered by the user clicking on the gadget. In this case, Intuition knows that the user is trying to select the gadget. Intuition doesn't know if the gadget can be activated, but if it can be activated, the event that triggered the activation has just taken place. If the gadget cannot become active for any reason, it must not let Intuition reuse that InputEvent as the gadget has already taken care of the the event's purpose (clicking on the gadget). In essence, the user tried to activate the gadget and the gadget refused to become active. The other two possible return values, GMR_NEXTACTIVE and GMR_PREVACTIVE were added to the OS for Release 2.04. These tell Intuition that a gadget does not want to be active and that the InputEvent should be discarded. Intuition then looks for the next (GMR_NEXTACTIVE) or previous (GMR_PREVACTIVE) gadget that has its GFLG_TABCYCLE flag set in its Gadget.Activation field (see the gadgetclass GA_TabCycle attribute in the Boopsi Class Reference in the Appendix B of this manual). For both GM_GOACTIVE and GM_HANDLEINPUT, the gadget can bitwise-OR any of these "go inactive" return values with GMR_VERIFY. The GMR_VERIFY flag tells Intuition to send a GADGETUP IntuiMessage to the gadget's window. If the gadget uses GMR_VERIFY, it has to supply a value for the IntuiMessage.Code field. It does this by passing a value in the gpInput.gpi_Termination field. This field points to a long word, the lower 16-bits of which Intuition copies into the Code field. The upper 16-bits are for future enhancements, so clear these bits. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
