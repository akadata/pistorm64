2 Intuition and the Graphical Interface / How the User Sees Intuition ]" border=0> Intuition solves the problem of interacting with multiple programs by dividing the display up into multiple screens and overlapping windows so that each application has its own work area. The user sees the Amiga environment through these windows, each of which can represent a different task or application context. Figure 2-1: The Workbench Screen With Windows The user performs operations inside screens and windows with the mouse , a mechanical device that moves a pointer over the Amiga's display. The user moves the mouse to position the pointer on graphic symbols of various objects or actions. Buttons on the mouse are pressed to select or activate the item pointed to. The user can switch back and forth between different jobs, such as writing a document, drawing an illustration, printing text, or getting help from the system simply by moving from one window to another with the mouse. With the mouse, the user can also change the shape and size of application windows , move them around on the screen, overlap them, bring a window to the foreground, and send a window to the background. By changing the arrangement of the windows, the user selects which information is visible and which application to work with next. ( Screens may also be moved up or down in the display, and they can be moved in front of or behind other screens.) Workbench and Preferences Intuition's 3D Look [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
