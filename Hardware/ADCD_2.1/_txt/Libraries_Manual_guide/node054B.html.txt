D / Errors / Fails only with Enhanced Chips ]" border=0> Usually caused by writing or reading addresses past the end of older custom chips, or writing something other than 0 (zero) to bits which are undefined in older chip registers, or failing to mask out undefined bits when interpreting the value read from a chip register. Note that system copper lists are different under 2.0 when ECS chips are present. See " Fails only on Chip-RAM-Only Machines ". [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
