12 / / The Boopsi Gadget Methods / GM_RENDER ]" border=0> Every time Intuition feels it is necessary to redraw a Boopsi gadget, it sends a gadget a GM_RENDER message. The GM_RENDER message (defined in gadgetclass.h >) tells a gadget to render itself: struct gpRender { ULONG MethodID; /* GM_RENDER */ struct GadgetInfo *gpr_GInfo; struct RastPort *gpr_RPort; /* all ready for use */ LONG gpr_Redraw; /* might be a "highlight pass" */ }; Some events that cause Intuition to send a GM_RENDER are: an application passed the gadget to OpenWindow() , the user moved or resized a gadget's window, or an application explicitly asked Intuition to refresh some gadgets. The GM_RENDER message contains a pointer to the gadget's RastPort so the GM_RENDER method does not have to extract it from the gpr_GInfo GadgetInfo structure using ObtainGIRPort() ). The gadget renders itself according to how much imagery it needs to replace. The gpr_Redraw field contains one of three values: GREDRAW_REDRAW Redraw the entire gadget. GREDRAW_UPDATE The user has manipulated the gadget, causing a change to its imagery. Update only that part of the gadget's imagery that is effected by the user manipulating the gadget (for example, the knob and scrolling field of the prop gadget). GREDRAW_TOGGLE If this gadget supports it, toggle to or from the highlighting imagery. Intuition is not the only entity that calls this method. The gadget's other methods may call this method to render the gadget when it goes through state changes. For example, as a prop gadget is following the mouse from the gadget's GM_HANDLEINPUT method, the gadget could send itself GM_RENDER messages, telling itself to update its imagery according to where the mouse has moved.
