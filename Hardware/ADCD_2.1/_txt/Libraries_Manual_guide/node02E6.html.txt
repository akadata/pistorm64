23 / List Functions / Empty Lists ]" border=0> It is often important to determine if a list is empty. This can be done in many ways, but only two are worth mentioning. If either the lh_TailPred field is pointing to the list header or the ln_Succ field of the lh_Head is NULL, then the list is empty. In C, for example, these methods would be written as follows: /* You can use this method... */ if (list->lh_TailPred == (struct Node *)list) printf("list is empty\n"); /* Or you can use this method */ if (NULL == list->lh_Head->ln_Succ) printf("list is empty\n"); In assembly code, if A0 points to the list header, these methods would be written as follows: ; Use this method... CMP.L LH_TAILPRED(A0),A0 BEQ list_is_empty ; Or use this method MOVE.L LH_HEAD(A0),A1 TST.L LN_SUCC(A1) BEQ list_is_empty Because LH_HEAD and LN_SUCC are both zero offsets, the second case may be simplified or optimized by your assembler.
