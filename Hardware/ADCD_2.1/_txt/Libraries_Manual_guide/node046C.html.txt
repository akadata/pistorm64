34 / Keymap Functions / Accessing the Keymap For the Current Console ]" border=0> The function AskKeyMap() shown below does not return a pointer to a table of pointers to currently assigned key mapping. Instead, it copies the current set of pointers to a user-designated area of memory. AskKeyMap() returns a TRUE or FALSE value that says whether or not the function succeeded. The function SetKeyMap(), also shown below, copies the designated key map data structure to the console device. Thus this routine is complementary to AskKeymap() in that it can restore an original key mapping as well as establish a new one. Ask/SetKeyMap() functions. -------------------------- These functions assume that you have already opened the console.device and that request is a valid IOStdReq structure for the newly opened console. These functions are not part of the keymap.library, nor of the console.device. These merely demonstrate CD_ASKKEYMAP and CD_SETKEYMAP which are console.device commands. /* These functions require that you have created a port and an IO request, * and have opened the console device as shown in the Console Device * chapter of the Devices volume of this manual set. */ #include BOOL AskKeyMap(struct IOStdReq *request, struct KeyMap *keymap) { request->io_Command = CD_ASKKEYMAP; request->io_Length = sizeof(struct KeyMap); request->io_Data = (APTR)keymap; /* where to put it */ DoIO(request); if(request->io_Error) return(FALSE); else return(TRUE); /* if no error, it worked. */ } BOOL SetKeyMap(struct IOStdReq *request,struct KeyMap *keymap) { request->io_Command = CD_SETKEYMAP; request->io_Length = sizeof(struct KeyMap); request->io_Data = (APTR)keymap; /* where to get it */ DoIO(request); if(request->io_Error) return(FALSE); else return(TRUE); /* if no error, it worked. */ } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
