31 / CxMessages / Controller Commands ]" border=0> The commands that a commodity can receive from the controller program (as defined in commodities.h >) are: CXCMD_DISABLE /* please disable yourself */ CXCMD_ENABLE /* please enable yourself */ CXCMD_KILL /* go away for good */ CXCMD_APPEAR /* open your window, if you can */ CXCMD_DISAPPEAR /* hide your window */ The CXCMD_DISABLE, CXCMD_ENABLE, and CXCMD_KILL commands correspond to the similarly named controller program gadgets, Disable, Enable, and Kill; CXCMD_APPEAR and CXCMD_DISAPPEAR correspond to the controller program gadgets, Show and Hide. These gadgets are ghosted in Broker.c because it has no window (It doesn't make much sense to give the user a chance to click the Show and Hide gadgets). In order to do this, Broker.c has to tell Commodities Exchange to ghost these gadgets. When CxBroker() sets up a broker , it looks at the NewBroker.nb_Flags field to see if the COF_SHOW_HIDE bit (from commodities.h >) is set. If it is, the "Show" and "Hide" gadgets for this broker will be selectable. Otherwise they are ghosted and disabled. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
