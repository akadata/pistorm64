21 / Task Exclusion / Task Semaphores ]" border=0> Semaphores can be used for the purposes of mutual exclusion. With this method of locking, all tasks agree on a locking convention before accessing shared data structures. Tasks that do not require access are not affected and will run normally, so this type of exclusion is considered preferable to forbidding and disabling. This form of exclusion is explained in more detail in the " Exec Semaphores " chapter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
