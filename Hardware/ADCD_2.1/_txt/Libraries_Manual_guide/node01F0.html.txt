TITLE: 10 / The Keyboard / Keyboard Control of the Pointer

10 / The Keyboard / Keyboard Control of the Pointer ]" border=0> All Intuition mouse activities can be emulated using the keyboard, by combining the Amiga command keys with other keystrokes. The pointer can be moved by holding down either Amiga key along with one of the four cursor keys. The mouse pointer accelerates the longer these keys are held down. Additionally, holding down either Shift key will make the pointer jump in larger increments. The pointer position may also be adjusted in very fine increments through this technique. By holding down either Amiga key and briefly pressing one of the cursor keys, the pointer may be moved one pixel in any direction. Press the left Alt key and either one of the Amiga keys simultaneously emulates the left button of the mouse. Similarly, pressing the right Alt key and either one of the Amiga keys simultaneously emulates the right button of the mouse. These key combinations permit users to make gadget selections and perform menu operations using the keyboard alone. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
