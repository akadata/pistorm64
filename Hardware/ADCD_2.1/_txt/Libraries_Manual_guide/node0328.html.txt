TITLE: 27 / / Viewport Display Modes / Single- vs. Dual-playfield Mode

27 / / Viewport Display Modes / Single- vs. Dual-playfield Mode ]" border=0> When you specify single-playfield mode you are asking that the system treat all bitplanes as part of the definition of a single playfield image. Each of the bitplanes defined as part of this ViewPort contributes data bits that determine the color of the pixels in a single playfield. Figure 27-12: A Single-playfield Display If you use dual-playfield mode, you can define two independent, separately controllable playfield areas as shown on the next page. Figure 27-13: A Dual-playfield Display In the previous figure, PFBA was included in the display mode. If PFBA had not been included, the relative priorities would have been reversed; playfield 2 would have appeared to be behind playfield 1. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
