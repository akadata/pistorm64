Amiga® RKM Libraries: 35 Math Libraries ]" border=0> This chapter describes the structure and calling sequences required to access the Motorola Fast Floating Point (FFP), the IEEE single-precision math libraries and the IEEE double-precision math libraries via the Amiga-supplied interfaces. In its present state, the FFP library consists of three separate entities: the basic math library, the transcendental math library, and C and assembly-language interfaces to the basic math library plus FFP conversion functions. The IEEE single-precision, introduced in Release 2, and the double-precision libraries each presently consists of two entities: the basic math library and the transcendental math library. Open Each Library Separately. ----------------------------- Each Task using an IEEE math library must open the library itself. Library base pointers to these libraries may not be shared. Libraries can be context sensitive and may use the Task structure to keep track of the current context. Sharing of library bases by Tasks may seem to work in some systems. This is true for any of the IEEE math libraries. Depending on the compiler used, it is not always necessary to explicitly call the library functions for basic floating point operations as adding, subtracting, dividing, etc. Consult the manual supplied with the compiler for information regarding the compiler options for floating point functions.
