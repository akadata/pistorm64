30 / / Working With Existing Layers / Determining Layer Position ]" border=0> If the viewing area has been separated into several layers, the application may need to find out which layer is topmost at a particular x,y coordinate. Use the WhichLayer() function for this: struct Layer *WhichLayer( struct Layer_Info *li, long x, long y ); To be sure that no task adds, deletes, or changes the sequence of layers before this information is used, call LockLayerInfo() before calling WhichLayer() , and call UnlockLayerInfo() when the operation is complete. In this way, the program may ensure that it is acting on valid information. Always check for a NULL return value (coordinate not in a layer) from WhichLayer(). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
