TITLE: 8 / Creating Borders / Linking Borders

8 / Creating Borders / Linking Borders ]" border=0> The NextBorder field can point to another instance of a Border structure. This allows complex graphic objects to be created by linking together Border structures, each with its own data points, color and draw mode. This might be used, for instance, to draw a double border around a requester or gadget where the outer border is a second Border structure, linked to the first inner border. Note that the borders can share data. For instance, to create a border with a shadow, link two borders together each of which points to the same XY data. Set the first border to draw in a dark pen (such as the SHADOWPEN from the screen's DrawInfo structure) and position the border down and to the right a few pixels by changing LeftEdge and TopEdge in the Border structure. The second border should be set to a bright pen (such as the SHINEPEN in the screen's DrawInfo structure). When the border is drawn, the first border will draw in a dark color and then the second border will be drawn over it in a light color. Since they use the same data set, and the dark border is shifted down and to the right, the border will have a three dimensional appearance. This technique is demonstrated in the example listed earlier in this section. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
