28 / Using Virtual Sprites / Reserved VSprite Members ]" border=0> These VSprite structure members are reserved for system use (do not write to them): NextVSprite and PrevVSprite -- These are used as links in the GelsInfo list. DrawPath and ClearPath -- These are used for Bobs, not true VSprites. OldY and OldX -- Previous position holder, the system uses these for double buffered Bobs, but application programs can read them too. The values can be set like this: myVSprite.NextVSprite = NULL; myVSprite.PrevVSprite = NULL; myVSprite.DrawPath = NULL; myVSprite.ClearPath = NULL; myVSprite.OldY = 0; myVSprite.OldX = 0; [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
