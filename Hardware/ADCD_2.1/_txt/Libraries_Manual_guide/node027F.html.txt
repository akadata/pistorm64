TITLE: 16 / Creating a File Requester / The Save Requester

16 / Creating a File Requester / The Save Requester ]" border=0> The save requester is a special type of file requester used for save operations. It differs from the regular ASL file requester in several ways. First, the color of the text making up the file names and the background color are interchanged. This makes it more apparent to the user that they are looking at a save requester (instead of the usual load requester). Another difference, is that a save requester does not allow the user to select an existing file name by double-clicking on an entry in the scrolling list gadget. This helps prevent the user from accidentally overwriting the wrong file. Save requesters can also create directories. If the user types a directory name into the save requester and the directory doesn't exist, the save requester will create that directory (after getting the user's permission via another requester). To create a save requester, set the FILF_SAVE flag of the ASL_FuncFlags tag. Remember that ASL tags and flag values are preserved across calls to AslRequest() , so if you use a save requester, you must clear the FILF_SAVE bit and reset your ASL_FuncFlags when you want a load requester. Note that it does not make sense to have multiselection in a save requester, so the FILF_SAVE flag overrides the FILF_MULTISELECT flag. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
