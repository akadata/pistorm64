TITLE: 3 / Other Screen Functions / Screen Movement and Scrolling

3 / Other Screen Functions / Screen Movement and Scrolling ]" border=0> The MoveScreen() function moves the screen origin by the number of pixels specified in dx and dy. VOID MoveScreen( struct Screen *myscreen, WORD dx, WORD dy ) Calls to MoveScreen() are asynchronous; the screen is not necessarily moved upon return of this function. If the calls happen too quickly, there may be unexpected results. One way to pace these calls is to call the function one time for each IDCMP_INTUITICKS event. Screen movement is also available through the screen's drag gadget in the title bar and through a keyboard/mouse shortcut. Left-Amiga with the select button of the mouse anywhere within the screen will drag the screen (even if the title bar is totally concealed by a window). Dragging a screen down will reveal any screen(s) behind it. Screens are never revealed to the left, right or bottom of another screen. Additionally, oversized screens may be moved with the new autoscroll feature of Release 2. With autoscroll, the screen is automatically scrolled as the pointer reaches one of the edges of the display. Autoscroll only works on the active screen. Another screen movement feature added in Release 2 is screen menu snap. When a screen much larger than the viewing area is scrolled such that the upper left corner is not visible (scrolled down or to the right), menus may could be out of the visible portion of the screen. To prevent this, menu snap moves the screen to a position where the menus will be visible before rendering them. The screen appears to snap to the home position as the menus are selected, moving back when the operation is complete. If the Left-Amiga qualifier is held when the menus are selected then the screen will remain in the home position when the menu button is released. The Intuition preferences editor, IControl, allows the user to change a number of Intuition features. Some of these features include the ability to globally disable menu snap, and to change the select qualifier for dragging the screen. See the User's Manual for more information on Preferences editors. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
