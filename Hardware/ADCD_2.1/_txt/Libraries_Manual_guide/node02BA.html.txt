TITLE: Amiga® RKM Libraries: 21 Exec Tasks

Amiga® RKM Libraries: 21 Exec Tasks ]" border=0> One of the most powerful features of the Amiga operating system is its ability to run and manage multiple independent program tasks, providing each task with processor time based on their priority and activity. These tasks include system device drivers, background utilities, and user interface environments, as well as normal application programs. This multitasking capability is provided by the Exec library's management of task creation, termination, scheduling, event signals, traps, exceptions, and mutual exclusion. This chapter deals with Exec on a lower level than most applications programmers need and assumes you are already familiar with the Exec basics discussed in the " Introduction to Exec " chapter of this manual.
