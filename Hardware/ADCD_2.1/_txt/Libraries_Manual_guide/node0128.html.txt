TITLE: 4 / Other Window Functions / Requesters in the Window

4 / Other Window Functions / Requesters in the Window ]" border=0> Requesters are temporary sub-windows, usually containing several gadgets, used to confirm actions, access files, or adjust the options of a command the user has just given. Request() creates and activates a requester in the window. EndRequest() removes the requester from the window. BOOL Request( struct Requester *requester, struct Window *window ); void EndRequest( struct Requester *requester, struct Window *window ); For simple requesters in a format that matches system requesters, two new functions have been added to Release 2: LONG EasyRequestArgs( struct Window *window, struct EasyStruct *easyStruct, ULONG *idcmpPtr, APTR args ); LONG EasyRequest( struct Window *window, struct EasyStruct *easyStruct, ULONG *idcmpPtr, APTR arg1, ... ); The EasyRequest() functions support requesters with one or more gadgets automatically providing a layout that is sensitive to the current font and screen resolution. See the chapter " Intuition Requesters and Alerts " for more information on using requester functions. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
