TITLE: 28 / / Detecting Gel Collisions / VSprite HitMask and MeMask

28 / / Detecting Gel Collisions / VSprite HitMask and MeMask ]" border=0> Software collision detection is independently enabled and disabled for each GEL. Further, you can specify which of 16 possible collision routines you wish to have automatically executed. DoCollision() , in addition to sensing an overlap between objects, uses these masks to determine which routine (if any) the system will call when a collision occurs. When the system determines a collision, it performs a logical-AND of the HitMask of the upper-leftmost object in the colliding pair with the MeMask of the lower-rightmost object of the pair. The bits that are 1s after the logical-AND operation choose which one of the 16 possible collision routines to perform. * If the collision is with the boundary, bit 0 is always a 1 and the system calls the collision handling routine number 0. Always assign the routine that handles boundary collisions to vector 0 in the collision handling table. The system uses the flag called BORDERHIT to indicate that an object has landed on or moved beyond the outermost bounds of the drawing area (the edge of the clipping region). The VSprite example earlier in this chapter uses collision detection to check for border hits. * If any one of the other bits (1 to 15) is set, then the system calls your collision handling routine corresponding to the bit set. * If more than one bit is set in both masks, the system calls the vector corresponding to the rightmost (the least significant) bit only.
