23 / List Functions / Searching by Name ]" border=0> Because many lists contain nodes with symbolic names attached (via the ln_Name field), it is possible to find a node by its name. This naming technique is used throughout Exec for such nodes as tasks, libraries, devices, and resources. The FindName() function searches a list for the first node with a given name. For example, FindName( header , "Furrbol") returns a pointer to the first node named "Furrbol." If no such node exists, a NULL is returned. The case of the name characters is significant; "foo" is different from "Foo." _______________________________________________________________________ | ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ | | | |____\| |____\| |____\| |__| | | lh_Head |/_ /| ln_Succ |/_ /| ln_Succ |/_ /| ln_Succ |/_ | |___________|\ \ |___________|\ \ |___________|\ \ |___________|\ | |_\| | \ | | \ | | \ | | | /| lh_Tail=0 | \| ln_Pred | \| ln_Pred | \| ln_Pred | | |___________| |___________| |___________| |___________| | | | | | | | | | | |lh_TailPred|__ | ln_Type | | ln_Type | | ln_Type | | |_ _ _ _ _ _| | |___________| |___________| |___________| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ln_Pri | | ln_Pri | | ln_Pri | | |_ _ _|_ _ _| | |___________| |___________| |___________| | | | | | | | | | | | ln_Name | | ln_Name | | ln_Name | | | |_ _ _ _ _ _| |_ _ _ _ _ _| |_ _ _ _ _ _| | | | | | | | | | | | Node | | Node | | Node | | | | Content | | Content | | Content | | | |_ _ _ _ _ _| |_ _ _ _ _ _| |_ _ _ _ _ _| | |_____________________________________________________| Figure 23-4: Complete Sample List Showing all Interconnections [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
