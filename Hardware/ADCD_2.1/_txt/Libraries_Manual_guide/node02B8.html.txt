TITLE: 20 / Other Memory Functions / Adding Memory to the System Pool

20 / Other Memory Functions / Adding Memory to the System Pool ]" border=0> When non-Autoconfig memory needs to be added to the system free pool, the AddMemList() function can be used. This function takes the size of the memoryblock, its type, the priority for the memory list, the base address and the name of the memory block. A MemHeader structure will be placed at the start of the memory block, the remainder of the memory block will be made available for allocation. For example: AddMemList(0x200000, MEMF_FAST, 0, 0xF00000, "FZeroBoard"); will add a two megabyte memory block, starting at $F00000 to the system free pool as Fast memory. The memory list entry is identified with "FZeroBoard". [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
