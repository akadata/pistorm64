14 / / Argument Passing In Workbench / Multiple Arguments ]" border=0> With extended select, the user can activate many icons at once. (Extended select means the user holds down the Shift key while clicking the mouse select button once on each icon in a group, double-clicking on the last icon.) If one of the icons in a group activated with extended select is an application tool, Workbench runs that application passing it the name of all the other icons in the group. This allows the user to start an application with multiple project files as arguments. If none of the icons in a group activated with extended select is a tool icon, then Workbench looks in the default tool field of each icon in the order they were selected and runs the first tool it finds.
