32 / / RigidDiskBlock and Alternate Filesystems / FileSysHeaderBlock ]" border=0> The current specification for the FileSysHeaderBlock follows. fhb_ID == 'FSHD' fhb_SummedLongs == 64 fhb_ChkSum block checksum (longword sum to zero) fhb_HostID SCSI Target ID of host This describes the initiator ID for the creator of this block. (see rdb_HostID discussion) fhb_Next block number of next FileSysHeaderBlock fhb_Flags see below for defines fhb_Reserved1[2] set to zero The following information is used to construct a FileSysEntry node in the FileSystem.resource. fhb_DosType file system description This is matched with a partition environment's de_DosType entry. fhb_Version release version of this load image Usually MSW is version, LSW is revision. fhb_PatchFlags patch flags These are bits set for those of the following that need to be substituted into a standard device node for this file system, lsb first: e.g. 0x180 to substitute SegList & GlobalVec fhb_Type device node type: zero fhb_Task standard dos "task" field: zero fhb_Lock not used for devices: zero fhb_Handler filename to loadseg: zero placeholder fhb_StackSize stacksize to use when starting task fhb_Priority task priority when starting task fhb_Startup startup msg: zero placeholder fhb_SegListBlocks first of linked list of LoadSegBlocks : Note that if the fhb_PatchFlags bit for this entry is set (bit 7), the blocks pointed to by this entry must be LoadSeg'd and the resulting BPTR put in the FileSysEntry node. fhb_GlobalVec BCPL global vector when starting task Zero or -1. fhb_Reserved2[23] (those reserved by PatchFlags) fhb_Reserved3[21] set to zero [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
