33 / / Custom Chunk Handlers / Installing a Custom Chunk Handler ]" border=0> To install an entry handler, you call EntryHandler() in the following manner: error = EntryHandler (iff, type, id, position, hookptr, object); An exit handler is installed by saying: error = ExitHandler (iff, type, id, position, hookptr, object); In both cases, a handler is installed for chunks having the specified type and id. The position argument specifies in what context to install the handler, and is identical to the position argument used by StoreLocalItem() . The hookptr argument given above is a pointer to your Hook structure. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
