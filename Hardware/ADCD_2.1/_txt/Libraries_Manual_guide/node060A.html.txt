Alternately, something like (A0,D2) would * show that a separate MOVE instruction is needed for each load. * * ##base _SampleBase * ##bias 30 * ##public * Double(n1)(D0) * AddThese(n1,n2)(D0/D1) * ##end * * After assembling, * JOIN sample_stubs.o sample_lvos.o AS sample.lib * * Apps LINK with LIBRARY sample.lib when calling sample.library functions *************************************************************************** INCLUDE "exec/types.i" INCLUDE "exec/libraries.i" SECTION data *----- LIBINIT initializes an LVO value to -30 to skip the first four *----- 6-byte required library vectors (Open, Expunge, etc) LIBINIT *----- LIBDEF assigns the current LVO value to a label, and then *----- bumps the LVO value by -6 in preparation for next LVO label *----- This assigns the value -30 to our first _LVO label LIBDEF _LVODouble ;-30 XDEF _LVODouble *----- The value -30-6 is asigned to our second _LVO label LIBDEF _LVOAddThese ;-36 XDEF _LVOAddThese END [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
