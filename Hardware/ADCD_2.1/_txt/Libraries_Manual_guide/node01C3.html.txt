8 / Creating Borders / Border Colors and Drawing Modes ]" border=0> Borders can select their colors from the values set in the color registers for the screen in which they are rendered. The available number of colors and palette settings are screen attributes and may not be changed through border rendering. Two drawing modes pertain to border lines: JAM1 and COMPLEMENT . To draw the line in a specific color, use the JAM1 draw mode. This mode converts each pixel in the line to the color set in the FrontPen field. Selecting the COMPLEMENT draw mode causes the line to be drawn in an exclusive-or mode that inverts the color of each pixel within the line. The data bits of the pixel are changed to their binary complement. This complement is formed by reversing all bits in the binary representation of the color register number. In a three bitplane display, for example, color 6 is 110 in binary. In COMPLEMENT draw mode, if a pixel is color 6, it will be changed to the 001 (binary), which is color 1. Note that a border drawn in COMPLEMENT mode can be removed from a static display by drawing the border again in the same position. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
