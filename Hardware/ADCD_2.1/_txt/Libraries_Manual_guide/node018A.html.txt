TITLE: 6 / Setting Up Menus / Help Key Processing in Menus

6 / Setting Up Menus / Help Key Processing in Menus ]" border=0> If the window is opened with the WA_MenuHelp tag, then user selection of the help key while menus are displayed will be detected. This tag is only available under V37 and later. When the user presses the Help key while using the menu system, the menu selection is terminated and an IDCMP_MENUHELP event is sent. The IDCMP_MENUHELP event is sent in place of the IDCMP_MENUPICK event, not in addition to it. IDCMP_MENUHELP never come as multi-select items, and the event terminates the menu processing session. The routine that handles the IDCMP_MENUHELP events must be very careful--it can receive menu information that is impossible under IDCMP_MENUPICK . IDCMP_MENUHELP events may be sent for any menu, item or sub-item in the menu strip, regardless of its state or position in the list. The program may receive events for items that are disabled or ghosted. IDCMP_MENUHELP events may send the menu header number alone, or the menu and item numbers, or all three components regardless of the items linked to the selected menu or item. This is done because it is reasonable for a user to request help in a disabled item or a menu header. If the user requests menu help on a disabled menu item or sub-item, try to explain to the user why that item is disabled and what steps are necessary to enable it. For instance, pressing help while a menu header is highlighted will trigger an IDCMP_MENUHELP event with a code that has a valid number for the menu, then NOITEM and NOSUB (IDCMP_MENUPICK would receive MENUNULL in this case.) The application should not take the action indicated by the IDCMP_MENUHELP event, it should provide the user with a description of the use or status of that menu. The application should never step through the NextSelect chain when it receives a IDCMP_MENUHELP event. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
