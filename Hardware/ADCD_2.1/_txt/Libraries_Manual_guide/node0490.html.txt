Amiga® RKM Libraries: 36 Translator Library ]" border=0> This chapter describes the translator library which, together with the narrator device, provides the Amiga's text-to-speech capability. To fully understand how speech is produced on the Amiga, you should also read the " Narrator Device " chapter of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices. The translator library provides a single function, Translate() , that converts an English language string into a phonetic string. You may then pass this phonetic string to the narrator device which will say the string using the Amiga's audio hardware. The two subsystems may also be used individually. You don't have to use the narrator to say the phonetic strings; you could use them instead for phonetic analysis or some other special purpose.
