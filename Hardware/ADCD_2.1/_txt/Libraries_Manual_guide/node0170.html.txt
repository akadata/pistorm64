5 / / Custom String Editing / EditOp Definitions ]" border=0> These values indicate the basic type of operation the global editing hook has performed on the string before the application gadget's custom editing hook gets called. Only global editing hooks must update the value in the EditOp field before they return. The value placed in the field should reflect the action taken. EditOp Action Taken by Global Hook ------ --------------------------- EO_NOOP Did nothing. EO_DELBACKWARD Deleted some chars (possibly 0). EO_DELFORWARD Deleted some characters under and in front of the cursor. EO_MOVECURSOR Moved the cursor. EO_ENTER Enter or Return key, terminate. EO_RESET Current Intuition-style undo. EO_REPLACECHAR Replaced one character and (maybe) advanced cursor. EO_INSERTCHAR Inserted one character into string or added one at end. EO_BADFORMAT Didn't like the text data, e.g., alpha characters in a GACT_LONGINT type. EO_BIGCHANGE Complete or major change to the text, e.g. new string. EO_UNDO Some other style of undo. EO_CLEAR Clear the string. EO_SPECIAL An operation that doesn't fit into the categories here. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
