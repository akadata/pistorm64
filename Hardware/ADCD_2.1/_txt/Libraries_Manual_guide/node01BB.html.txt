8 / Creating Images / Directly Drawing the Image ]" border=0> As noted above, you use the DrawImage() call to directly draw an image into a screen or window RastPort . void DrawImage( struct RastPort *rp, struct Image *image, long leftOffset, long topOffset ); The rp argument is a pointer to the RastPort into which the image should be drawn. This RastPort may come from a Window or Screen structure. The image argument is a pointer to the list of Image structures that are to be rendered. The list may contain a single Image structure. The leftOffset and topOffset arguments are the external component, or the base position, for this list of images. The LeftEdge and TopEdge values of each Image structure are added to these values to determine the final position of each image. Images may also be indirectly drawn by attaching them to gadgets, menus or requesters when they are initialized. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
