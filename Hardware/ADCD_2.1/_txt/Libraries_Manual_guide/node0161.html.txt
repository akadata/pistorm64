TITLE: 5 / / Initialization of Proportional Gadget / the PropInfo Structure

5 / / Initialization of Proportional Gadget / the PropInfo Structure ]" border=0> This is the special data required by the proportional gadget. struct PropInfo { UWORD Flags; UWORD HorizPot; UWORD VertPot; UWORD HorizBody; UWORD VertBody; UWORD CWidth; UWORD CHeight; UWORD HPotRes, VPotRes; UWORD LeftBorder; UWORD TopBorder; }; Flags In the Flags variable, the following flag bits are of interest: PROPBORDERLESS Set the PROPBORDERLESS flag to create a proportional gadget without a border. AUTOKNOB Set the AUTOKNOB flag in the Flags field to use the auto-knob , otherwise the application must provide knob imagery. FREEHORIZ and FREEVERT Set the FREEHORIZ flag to create a gadget that adjust left-to-right, set the FREEVERT flag for top-to-bottom movement. Both flags may be set in a single gadget. PROPNEWLOOK Set the PROPNEWLOOK flag to create a gadget with the new look. If this flag is not set, the gadget will be rendered using a V34 compatible design. KNOBHIT The KNOBHIT flag is set by Intuition when this knob is hit by the user. HorizPot and VertPot Initialize the HorizPot and VertPot variables to their starting values before the gadget is added to the system. The variables may be read by the application. The gadget must be removed before writing to these variables, or they may be modified with NewModifyProp() . HorizBody and VertBody Set the HorizBody and VertnBody variables to the desired increment. If there is no data to show or the total amount displayed is less than the area in which to display it, set the body variables to the maximum, MAXBODY. The remaining variables and flags are reserved for use by Intuition. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
