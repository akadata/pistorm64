TITLE: 23 / List Functions / Scanning a List

23 / List Functions / Scanning a List ]" border=0> Occasionally a program may need to scan a list to locate a particular node, find a node that has a field with a particular value, or just print the list. Because lists are linked in both the forward and backward directions, the list can be scanned from either the head or tail. Here is a code fragment that uses a for loop to print the names of all nodes in a list: struct List *list; struct Node *node; for (node = list->lh_Head ; node->ln_Succ ; node = node->ln_Succ) printf("%lx -> %s\n",node,node->ln_Name); A common mistake is to process the head or tail nodes. Valid data nodes have non-NULL successor and predecessor pointers. The above loop exits when node->ln_Succ is NULL. Another common mistake is to free a node from within a loop, then reference the free memory to obtain the next node pointer. An extra temporary pointer solves this second problem. In assembly code, it is more efficient to use a look-ahead cache pointer when scanning a list. In this example the list is scanned until the first zero-priority node is reached: MOVE.L (A1),D1 ; first node scan: MOVE.L D1,A1 MOVE.L (A1),D1 ; lookahead to next BEQ.S not_found ; end of list... TST.B LN_PRI(A1) BNE.S scan ... ; found one not_found: Exec List Example [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
