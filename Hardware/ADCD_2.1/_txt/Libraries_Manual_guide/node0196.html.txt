TITLE: 6 / / Intercepting Menu Operations / Shortcuts and IDCMP_MENUVERIFY

6 / / Intercepting Menu Operations / Shortcuts and IDCMP_MENUVERIFY ]" border=0> The idea behind IDCMP_MENUVERIFY is to synchronize the program with Intuition's menu handling sessions. The motive was to allow a program to arbitrate access to a custom screen's bitmap, so that Intuition would not render menus before the application was prepared for them. Some programs use IDCMP_MENUVERIFY to permit them to intercept the right mouse button for their own purposes. Other programs use it to delay menu operations while they recover from unusual events such as illegible colors of the screen or double buffering and related ViewPort operations. Menu shortcut keystrokes, for compatibility, also respect IDCMP_MENUVERIFY . They are always paired with an IDCMP_MENUPICK message so that the program knows the menu operation is over. This is true even if the menu event is cancelled. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
