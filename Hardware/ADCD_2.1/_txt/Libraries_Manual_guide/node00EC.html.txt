TITLE: 3 / DrawInfo and the 3D Look / The Pen Specification in DrawInfo

3 / DrawInfo and the 3D Look / The Pen Specification in DrawInfo ]" border=0> The drawing pen specification in DrawInfo.dri_Pens allows applications to use appropriate colors for graphic operations such as drawing text, shading 3D objects and filling items selected by the user. Intuition has two default sets of pens, one for multi-bitplane screens and one for single bitplane screens. In addition, there is a special compatibility mode for screens that do not specify the SA_Pens tag. New 3D Look The is the full 3D look as found by default on the Workbench screen in Release 2. Objects are drawn so that light appears to come from the upper left of the screen with shadows cast to the lower right giving them a three-dimensional look. Monochrome New Look It is impossible to produce the full 3D look in a single bitplane (two color) screen. Intuition provides a fallback pen specification that is used in monochrome screens with no loss of information. Compatible New Look Custom screens that do not provide the SA_Pens tag are assumed to have no knowledge of the pen array. They are rendered in a special version of the monochrome new look, which uses the screen's DetailPen and BlockPen to get its colors. This is provided for compatibility with V34 and older versions of the operating system. It is very easy for an application to use the default pen specification. Simply specify an empty pen specification (in C, {~0}), and Intuition will fill in all of the values with defaults appropriate for the screen. This technique is demonstrated in the first two examples ( newlookscreen.c and screen34to37.c )listed earlier in this chapter. For certain applications, a custom pen specification is required. A custom pen specification is set up when the screen is opened by using the SA_Pens tag and a pointer to a pen array. Currently, Intuition uses nine pens to support the 3D look. The application can specify all of these, or only a few pens and Intuition will fill in the rest. Intuition will only fill in pens that are past the end of those specified by the application, there is no facility for using default values for "leading" pens (those at the beginning of the array) without using the defaults for the rest of the pens. Using the pen specification of an existing public screen is a bit more involved. First, the application must get a pointer to the screen structure of the public screen using the LockPubScreen() call. A copy of the screen's DrawInfo structure may then be obtained by calling GetScreenDrawInfo() . The DrawInfo structure contains a copy of the pen specification for the screen that can be used in the OpenScreenTagList() call with the SA_Pens tag. The pen array is copied to the data structures of the new screen (it is not kept as a pointer to the information passed), so the application may immediately call FreeScreenDrawInfo() and UnlockPubScreen() after the new screen is open. publicscreen.c Beginning with V36, the pen specification for the Workbench screen happens to match the Intuition default specification, however, this is not required and may change in the future. To create a screen that uses the pens defined in the Workbench screen, the application must get a copy of the pen array from the Workbench screen and use this copy with the SA_Pens tag as described above. Here is a list of the pens defined under V36 that support the 3D look along with their uses. To read the value of a particular pen, use UWORD penvalue = myDrawInfo->dri_Pens[PENNAME], where myDrawInfo is a pointer to a DrawInfo structure and PENNAME is taken from the list below: DETAILPEN Pen compatible with V34. Used to render text in the screen's title bar. BLOCKPEN Pen compatible with V34. Used to fill the screen's title bar. TEXTPEN Pen for regular text on BACKGROUNDPEN. SHINEPEN Pen for the bright edge on 3D objects. SHADOWPEN Pen for the dark edge on 3D objects. FILLPEN Pen for filling the active window borders and selected gadgets. FILLTEXTPEN Pen for text rendered over FILLPEN. BACKGROUNDPEN Pen for the background color. Currently must be zero. HIGHLIGHTTEXTPEN Pen for "special color" or highlighted text on BACKGROUNDPEN.
