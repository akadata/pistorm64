28 / / Displaying the VSprites / Drawing the Graphics Elements ]" border=0> The system function called DrawGList() looks through the list of GELS and prepares the necessary Copper instructions and memory areas to display the data. This function is called as follows: struct RastPort myRastPort = {0}; struct ViewPort myViewPort = {0}; DrawGList(&myRastPort, &myViewPort); The myRastPort argument specifies the RastPort containing the GelsInfo list with the VSprites that you want to display. The &myViewPort argument is a pointer to the ViewPort for which the VSprites will be created. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
