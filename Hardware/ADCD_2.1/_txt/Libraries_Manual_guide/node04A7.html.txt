TITLE: 37 Utility Library / Date Functions

37 Utility Library / Date Functions ]" border=0> To ease date-related calculations, the utility library has some functions to convert a date, specified in a ClockData structure, in the number of seconds since 00:00:00 01-Jan-78 and vice versa. To indicate the date, the ClockData structure (in date.h >) is used. struct ClockData { UWORD sec; /* seconds (0 - 59)*/ UWORD min; /* minutes (0 - 59) */ UWORD hour; /* hour (0 - 23) */ UWORD mday; /* day of the month (1 - 31) */ UWORD month; /* month of the year (1 - 12) UWORD year; /* 1978 - */ UWORD wday; /* day of the week (0 - 6, where 0 is Sunday) */ }; The following functions are available to operate on ClockData: ________________________________________________________________ | | | Amiga2Date() Calculate the date from the specified timestamp | | (in seconds). | | CheckDate() Check the legality of a date. | | Date2Amiga() Calculate the timestamp from the specified date. | |________________________________________________________________| Table 37-5: Utility Library Date Functins Amiga2Date() takes a number of seconds from 01-Jan-78 as argument and fills in the supplied ClockData structure with the date and time. CheckDate() checks if the supplied ClockData structure is valid, and returns the number of seconds from 01-Jan-78 if it is. Note that this function currently does not take the supplied day of the week in account. Date2Amiga() takes a ClockData structure as argument and returns the number of seconds since 01-Jan-78. The supplied ClockData structure MUST be valid, since no checking is done. The following example shows various uses of the utility library date functions. a2d.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
