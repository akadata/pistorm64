13 / Preferences in 1.3 and Older Versions / Reading 1.3 Preferences ]" border=0> Applications can obtain a copy of Preferences by calling the Intuition function GetPrefs() . In a system in which there is no devs:system-configuration file, GetDefPrefs() can be used to obtain the Intuition default Preference settings. struct Preferences *GetPrefs(struct Preferences *preferences, LONG size); struct Preferences *GetDefPrefs(struct Preferences *preferences, LONG size); GetPrefs() and GetDefPrefs() have two arguments, a pointer to a buffer to receive the copy of the user Preferences and the size of this buffer. The most commonly used data is grouped near the beginning of the Preferences structure and you are free to read only as much as you need. So, if you are only interested in the first part of the Preferences structure, you do not need to allocate a buffer large enough to hold the entire structure. These functions return a pointer to your buffer if successful, NULL otherwise. If you are using Intuition IDCMP for input, you can set the IDCMP flag IDCMP_NEWPREFS (formerly the NEWPREFS flag under V34 and earlier versions of the OS). With this flag set, your program will receive an IntuiMessage informing you changes have been made to Preferences. To get the latest settings, you would again call GetPrefs() .
