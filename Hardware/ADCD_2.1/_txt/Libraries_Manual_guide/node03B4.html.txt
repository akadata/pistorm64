TITLE: 28 / / / Parameters To Your Boundary Collision Routine

28 / / / Parameters To Your Boundary Collision Routine ]" border=0> During the operation of the DoCollision() routine, if you have enabled boundary collisions for a GEL (by setting the least significant bit of its HitMask ) and it has crossed a boundary, the system calls the boundary routine you have defined. The system will call the routine once for every GEL that has hit, or gone outside of the boundary. The system will call your routine with the following two arguments: * A pointer to the VSprite structure of the GEL that hit the boundary * A flag word containing one to four bits set, representing top, bottom, left and right boundaries, telling you which of the boundaries it has hit or exceeded. To test these bits, compare to the constants TOPHIT, BOTTOMHIT, LEFTHIT, and RIGHTHIT. See the VSprite example given earlier for an example of using boundary collision.
