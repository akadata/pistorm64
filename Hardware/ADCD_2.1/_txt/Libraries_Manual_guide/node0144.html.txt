TITLE: 5 / Gadget Refreshing / Gadget Refreshing by the Program

5 / Gadget Refreshing / Gadget Refreshing by the Program ]" border=0> The AddGList() function adds gadgets to Intuition's internal lists but do not display their imagery. Subsequently calls to RefreshGList() must be made to draw the gadgets into the window or requester. Programs may use RefreshGList() to update the display after making changes to their gadgets. The supported changes include (not an exhaustive list): changing the GFLG_SELECTED flag for boolean gadgets to implement mutually exclusive gadgets, changing the GadgetText of a gadget to change its label, changing the GFLG_DISABLED flag, and changing the contents of the StringInfo structure Buffer of a string gadget. When making changes to a gadget, be sure to remove the gadget from the system with RemoveGList() before altering it. Remember to add the gadget back and refresh its imagery. Boolean gadgets rendered with borders, instead of images, or highlighted with surrounding boxes ( GFLG_GADGHBOX ) are handled very simply by Intuition, and complicated transitions done by the program can get the rendering out of phase. Applications should avoid modifying the imagery and refreshing gadgets that may be highlighted due to selection by the user. Such operations may leave pixels highlighted when the gadget is no longer selected. The problems with such transitions can often be avoided by providing imagery, either image or border, that covers all pixels in the select box. For GFLG_GADGHIMAGE gadgets, the select imagery should cover all pixels covered in the normal imagery. Updating a Gadget's Imagery gadget Refresh Function [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
