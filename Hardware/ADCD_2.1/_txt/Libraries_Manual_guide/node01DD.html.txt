9 / / Event Message Classes and Flags / Gadget Flags ]" border=0> IDCMP_GADGETDOWN IDCMP_GADGETDOWN messages are sent when the user selects a gadget that was created with the GACT_IMMEDIATE flag set. The IntuiMessage structure's IAddress field will contain a pointer to the selected gadget. IDCMP_GADGETUP IDCMP_GADGETUP messages are sent when the user selects a gadget that was created with the GACT_RELVERIFY flag set. The IntuiMessage structure's IAddress field will contain a pointer to the selected gadget. IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW messages are sent when the user selects the window's close gadget. Intuition does not close the window when the close gadget is selected. Rather, an IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW message is sent to the window's IDCMP. It is up to the application to clean up and close the window itself. If closing a window means losing some data (perhaps the spreadsheet the user was working on), it would be appropriate for the application to first confirm that the user really meant to close the window.
