31 Commodities Exchange Library / CxObjects ]" border=0> CxObjects are the basic building blocks used to construct a commodity. A commodity uses CxObjects to take care of all manipulations of CxMessages . When a CxMessage "arrives" at a CxObject, that CxObject carries out its primitive action and then, if it has not deleted the CxMessage, it passes the CxMessage on to the next CxObject. A commodity links together CxObjects into a tree, organizing these simple action objects to perform some higher function. A CxObject is in one of two states, active or inactive. An active CxObject performs its primitive action every time it receives a CxMessage . If a CxObject is inactive, CxMessages bypass it, continuing to the CxObject that follows the inactive one. By default, all CxObjects except the type called brokers are created in the active state. Currently, there are seven types of CxObjects (Table 31-1). Object Type Purpose ----------- ------- Broker Registers a new commodity with the commodity network Filter Accepts or rejects input events based on criteria set up by the application Sender Sends a message to a message port Translate Replaces the input event with a different one Signal Signals a task Custom Calls a custom function provided by the commodity Debug Sends debug information out the serial port Table 31-1: Commodities Exchange Object Types [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
