TITLE: 3 / Custom Screen Functions / Creating A New Custom Screen

3 / Custom Screen Functions / Creating A New Custom Screen ]" border=0> There are three functions you can use to open a custom screen : OpenScreen() , OpenScreenTags() or OpenScreenTagList() . Prior to Release 2 (V36), OpenScreen() was used to create a new screen. With V36 and later versions of the operating system, this call is superseded by OpenScreenTagList() and OpenScreenTags(). struct Screen *OpenScreen( struct NewScreen *) struct Screen *OpenScreenTagList( struct NewScreen * , struct TagItem *) struct Screen *OpenScreenTags( struct NewScreen *, ULONG, ULONG, ... ) The old OpenScreen() call relied on a fixed size data structure ( NewScreen ) which made little allowance for extensions and growth. The new calls are tag based, allowing for the addition of new features without modification of existing structures and applications. The " Screen Attributes " section below contains a complete list of all the tag options available for setting up an Intuition screen. For a general description of tag items, see the " Utility Library " chapter.
