D / Errors / Hang--One Program Only ]" border=0> Program hangs are generally caused by Wait() ing on the wrong signal bits, on the wrong port, on the wrong message, or on some other event that will never occur. This can occur if the event you are waiting on is not coming, or if one task tries to Wait(), WaitPort() , or WaitIO() on a signal, port, or window that was created by a different task. Both WaitIO() and WaitPort() can call Wait(), and you cannot Wait() on another task's signals. Hangs can also be caused by verify deadlocks. Be sure to turn off all Intuition verify messages (such as MENUVERIFY ) before calling AutoRequest() or doing disk access. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
