TITLE: 23 / List Functions / Important Note About Shared Lists

23 / List Functions / Important Note About Shared Lists ]" border=0> It is possible to run into contention problems with other tasks when manipulating a list that is shared by more than one task. None of the standard Exec list functions arbitrates for access to the list. For example, if some other task happens to be modifying a list while your task scans it, an inconsistent view of the list may be formed. This can result in a corrupted system. Generally it is not permissible to read or write a shared list without first locking out access from other tasks. All users of a list must use the same arbitration method. Several arbitration techniques are used on the Amiga. Some lists are protected by a semaphore. The ObtainSemaphore() call grants ownership of the list (see the " Exec Semaphores " chapter for more information). Some lists require special arbitration. For example, you must use the Intuition LockIBase (0) call before accessing any Intuition lists. Other lists may be accessed only during Forbid() or Disable() (see the " Exec Tasks " chapter for more information). The preferred method for arbitrating use of a shared list is through semaphores because a semaphores only holds off other tasks that are trying to access the shared list. Rather than suspending all multitasking. Failure to lock a shared list before use will result in unreliable operation. Note that I/O functions including printf() generally call Wait() to wait for I/O completion, and this allows other tasks to run. Therefore, it is not safe to print or Wait() while traversing a list unless the list is fully controlled by your application, or if the list is otherwise guaranteed not to change during multitasking.
