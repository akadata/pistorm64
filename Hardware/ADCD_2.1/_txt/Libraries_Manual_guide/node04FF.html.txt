B / gadgetclass / Attributes:GA_IntuiText, GA_Text, GA_LabelImage (IS) ]" border=0> These attributes correspond to one field in the object's embedded Gadget structure--the GadgetText field. Setting any of these attributes copies the attribute's value blindly into the GadgetText field. In addition, setting GA_Text also sets the GFLG_LABELSTRING flag in Gadget.Flags and setting GA_LabelImage sets the GFLG_LABELIMAGE flag in Gadget.Flags. The GA_IntuiText attribute must be an IntuiText pointer, as with old-style gadgets. GA_Text takes a pointer to a NULL- terminated string (UBYTE *). GA_LabelImage takes a pointer to a (Boopsi) image. Note that most gadget classes do not support GA_Text and GA_LabelImage. See the description of specific gadget classes for more details. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
