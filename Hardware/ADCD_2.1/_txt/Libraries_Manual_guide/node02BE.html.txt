TITLE: 21 / Task Creation / Task Stack

21 / Task Creation / Task Stack ]" border=0> Every task requires a stack. All task stacks are user mode stacks (in the language of the 68000) and are addressed through the A7 CPU register. All normal code execution occurs on this task stack. Special modes of execution (processor traps and system interrupts for example) execute on a single supervisor mode stack and do not directly affect task stacks. Task stacks are normally used to store local variables, subroutine return addresses, and saved register values. Additionally, when a task loses the processor, all of its current registers are preserved on this stack (with the exception of the stack pointer itself, which must be saved in the task structure). The amount of stack used by a task can vary widely. The theoretical minimum stack size is 72 bytes, which is the number required to save 17 CPU registers and a single return address. Of course, a stack of this size would not give you adequate space to perform any subroutine calls (because the return address occupies stack space). On the other hand, a stack size of 1K would suffice to call most system functions but would not allow much in the way of local variable storage. Processes that call DOS library functions need an additional 1500 bytes of stack. Because stack-bounds checking is not provided as a service of Exec, it is important to provide enough space for your task stack. Stack overflows are always difficult to debug and may result not only in the erratic failure of your task but also in the mysterious malfunction of other Amiga subsystems. Some compilers provide a stack-checking option. You Can't Always Check The Stack. --------------------------------- Such stack-checking options generally cannot be used if part of your code will be running on the system stack (interrupts, 680x0 exceptions, handlers, servers), or on a different task's stack (libraries, devices, created tasks). When choosing your stack size, do not cut it too close. Remember that any recursive routines in your code may use varying amounts of stack, and that future versions of system routines may use additional stack variables. By dynamically allocating buffers and arrays, most application programs can be designed to function comfortably within the default process stack size of 4000 bytes. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
