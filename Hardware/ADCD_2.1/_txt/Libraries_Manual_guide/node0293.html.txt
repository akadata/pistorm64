18 / What is a Library? / Using a Library to Reference Data ]" border=0> Most libraries (such as Intuition, graphics and Exec) have other data that follows the Library data structure in memory. Although it is not normally necessary, a program can use the library base pointer to access the Library structure and any custom library data. In general, the system's library base data is read-only, and should be directly accessed as little as possible, primarily because the format of the data may change in future revisions of the library. If the library provides functions to allow access to library data, use those instead. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
