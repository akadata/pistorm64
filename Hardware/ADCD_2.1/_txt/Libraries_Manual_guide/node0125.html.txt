4 / Window Attributes / Boolean Window Attribute Tags ]" border=0> These boolean window tags are alternatives to the NewWindow .Flags bit fields with similar names. Unlike the tags discussed above, the ti_Data field of these TagItems is set to either TRUE or FALSE. WA_SizeGadget Specifying this flag tells Intuition to add a sizing gadget to the window. Intuition places the sizing gadget in the lower right corner of the window. By default, the right border is adjusted to accommodate the sizing gadget, but the application can specify one of the following two flags to change this behavior. The WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT flag puts the sizing gadget in the right border. The WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM flag puts the sizing gadget in the bottom border. Both flags may be specified, placing the gadget in both borders. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_SIZEGADGET. WA_SizeBRight Place the size gadget in the right border. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT. WA_SizeBBottom Place the size gadget in the bottom border. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM. WA_DragBar This flag turns the entire title bar of the window into a drag gadget, allowing the user to position the window by clicking in the title bar and dragging the mouse. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_DRAGBAR. WA_DepthGadget Setting this flag adds a depth gadget to the window. This allows the user to change the window's depth arrangement with respect to other windows on the screen. Intuition places the depth gadget in the upper right corner of the window. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_DEPTHGADGET. WA_CloseGadget Setting this flag attaches a close gadget to the window. When the user selects this gadget, Intuition transmits a message to the application. It is up to the application to close the window with a CloseWindow() call. Intuition places the close gadget in the upper left corner of the window. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_CLOSEGADGET. WA_ReportMouse Send mouse movement events to the window as x,y coordinates. Also see the description of the IDCMP flag IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE , in the chapter "Intuition Input and Output Methods." Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_REPORTMOUSE. The WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag in the Flags field of the Window structure may be modified on the fly by the program. Changing this flag must be done as an atomic operation. Most compilers generate atomic code for operations such as window->flags |= WFLG_REPORTMOUSE or window->flags &= ~WFLG_REPORTMOUSE. If you are unsure of getting an atomic operation from your compiler, you may wish to do this operation in assembler, or bracket the code with a Forbid()/Permit() pair. The use of the ReportMouse() function is strongly discouraged, due to historic confusion over the parameter ordering. WA_NoCareRefresh This window does not want IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW events. Set this flag to prevent the window from receiving refresh window messages. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH. Intuition will manage BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh() internally. WA_Borderless Open a window with no borders rendered by Intuition. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_BORDERLESS. Use caution setting this flag, as it may cause visual confusion on the screen. Also, some borders may be rendered if any of the system gadgets are requested, if text is supplied for the window's title bar, or if any of application gadgets are in the borders. WA_Backdrop Make this window a Backdrop window. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_BACKDROP. WA_GimmeZeroZero Set this tag to create a GimmeZeroZero window. GimmeZeroZero windows have the window border and border gadgets rendered into an extra layer. This extra layer slows down window operations, thus it is recommended that applications only use GimmeZeroZero windows when they are required. For clipping graphics to the area within the borders of a window, see the discussion of " Regions " in the "Layers Library" chapter. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO. WA_Activate Activate the window when it opens. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_ACTIVATE. Use this flag carefully, as it can change where the user's input is going. WA_RMBTrap Catch right mouse button events for application use. Set this flag to disable menu operations for the window. When set, right mouse button events will be received as IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS with the MENUUP and MENUDOWN qualifiers. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_RMBTRAP. The WFLG_RMBTRAP flag in the Window structure Flags field may be modified on the fly by the program. Changing this flag must be done as an atomic operation, as Intuition can preempt a multistep set or clear operation. An atomic operation can be done in assembler, using 68000 instructions that operate directly on memory. If you are unsure of generating such an instruction, place the operation within a Forbid()/Permit() pair. This will ensure proper operation by disabling multitasking while the flag is being changed. WA_SimpleRefresh The application program takes complete responsibility for updating the window. Only specify if TRUE. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_SIMPLE_REFRESH. WA_SmartRefresh Intuition handles all window updating, except for parts of the window revealed when the window is sized larger. Only specify if TRUE. Equivalent to NewWindow .Flags WFLG_SMART_REFRESH. WA_SmartRefresh windows without a sizing gadget will never receive refresh events due to the user sizing the window. However, if the application sizes the window through a call like ChangeWindowBox() , ZipWindow() or SizeWindow() , a refresh event may be generated. Use WA_NoCareRefresh to disable refresh events. WA_SuperBitMap This is a pointer to a BitMap structure for a SuperBitMap window. The application will be allocating and maintaining its own bitmap. Equivalent to NewWindow .BitMap. Setting this tag implies the WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP property. For complete information about SuperBitMap, see " Setting Up a SuperBitMap Window " in this chapter. WA_AutoAdjust Allow Intuition to change the window's position and dimensions in order to fit it on screen. The window's position is adjusted first, then the size. This property may be especially important when using WA_InnerWidth and WA_InnerHeight as border size depends on a user specified font. WA_MenuHelp (new for V37, ignored by V36) Enables IDCMP_MENUHELP : pressing Help during menus will return IDCMP_MENUHELP message. See the " Intuition Menus " chapter for more information. WA_Flags Multiple initialization of window flags, equivalent to NewWindow .Flags. Use the WFLG_ constants to initialize this field, multiple bits may be set by ORing the values together. WA_BackFill Allows you to specify a backfill hook for your window's layer. See the description of CreateUpFrontHookLayer() in the "Includes and Autodocs" manual. Note that this tag is implemented in V37, contrary to what some versions of the include files may say. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
