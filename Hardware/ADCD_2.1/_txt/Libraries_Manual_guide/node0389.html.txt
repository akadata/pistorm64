28 / Using Virtual Sprites / Adding and Removing VSprites ]" border=0> Once a true VSprite has been set up and initialized, the obvious next step is to give it to the system by adding it to the GEL list. The VSprite may then be manipulated as needed. Before the program ends, the VSprite should be removed from the GELs list by calling RemVSprite() . A typical calling sequence could be performed like so: struct VSprite myVSprite = {0}; struct RastPort myRastPort = {0}; AddVSprite(&myVSprite, &myRastPort); /* Manipulate the VSprite as needed here */ RemVSprite(&myVSprite); The &myVSprite argument is a fully initialized VSprite structure and &myRastPort is the RastPort with which this VSprite is to be associated. Note that you will probably not like the results if you try to RemVSprite() a VSprite that has not been added to the system with AddVSprite() .
