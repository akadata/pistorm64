TITLE: 31 Commodities Exchange / Filter Objects and Input Description Strings

31 Commodities Exchange / Filter Objects and Input Description Strings ]" border=0> Because not all commodities are interested in every input event that makes it way down the input chain, Commodities Exchange has a method for filtering them. A filter CxObject compares the CxMessages it receives to a pattern. If a CxMessage matches the pattern, the filter diverts the CxMessage down its personal list of CxObjects. CxObj *CxFilter(UBYTE *descriptionstring); The C macro CxFilter() (defined in commodities.h >) returns a pointer to a filter CxObject . The macro has only one argument, a pointer to a string describing which input events to filter. The following regular expression outlines the format of the input event description string ( CX_POPKEY uses the same description string format): [class] {[-] (qualifier|synonym)} [[-] upstroke] [highmap|ANSICode] Class can be any one of the class strings in the table below. Each class string corresponds to a class of input event as defined in inputevent.h >. Commodities Exchange will assume the class is rawkey if the class is not explicitly stated. Class String Input Event Class ------------ ----------------- "rawkey" IECLASS_RAWKEY "rawmouse" IECLASS_RAWMOUSE "event" IECLASS_EVENT "pointerpos" IECLASS_POINTERPOS "timer" IECLASS_TIMER "newprefs" IECLASS_NEWPREFS "diskremoved" IECLASS_DISKREMOVED "diskinserted" IECLASS_DISKINSERTED Qualifier is one of the qualifier strings from the table below. Each string corresponds to an input event qualifier as defined in inputevent.h >). A dash preceding the qualifier string tells the filter object not to care if that qualifier is present in the input event. Notice that there can be more than one qualifier (or none at all) in the input description string. Qualifier String Input Event Class ---------------- ----------------- "lshift" IEQUALIFIER_LSHIFT "rshift" IEQUALIFIER_RSHIFT "capslock" IEQUALIFIER_CAPSLOCK "control" IEQUALIFIER_CONTROL "lalt" IEQUALIFIER_LALT "ralt" IEQUALIFIER_RALT "lcommand" IEQUALIFIER_LCOMMAND "rcommand" IEQUALIFIER_RCOMMAND "numericpad" IEQUALIFIER_NUMERICPAD "repeat" IEQUALIFIER_REPEAT "midbutton" IEQUALIFIER_MIDBUTTON "rbutton" IEQUALIFIER_RBUTTON "leftbutton" IEQUALIFIER_LEFTBUTTON "relativemouse" IEQUALIFIER_RELATIVEMOUSE Synonym is one of the synonym strings from the table below. These strings act as synonyms for groups of qualifiers. Each string corresponds to a synonym identifier as defined in commodities.h >. A dash preceding the synonym string tells the filter object not to care if that synonym is present in the input event. Notice that there can be more than one synonym (or none at all) in the input description string. Synonym Synonym String Identifier ------- ---------- "shift" IXSYM_SHIFT /* look for either shift key */ "caps" IXSYM_CAPS /* look for either shift key or capslock */ "alt" IXSYM_ALT /* look for either alt key */ Upstroke is the literal string "upstroke". If this string is absent, the filter considers only downstrokes. If it is present alone, the filter considers only upstrokes. If preceded by a dash, the filter considers both upstrokes and downstrokes. Highmap is one of the following strings: "space", "backspace", "tab", "enter", "return", "esc", "del", "up", "down", "right", "left", "f1", "f2", "f3", "f4", "f5", "f6", "f7", "f8", "f9", "f10", "help". ANSICode is a single character (for example `a') that Commodities Exchange looks up in the system default keymap. Here are some example description strings. For function key F2 with the left Shift and either Alt key pressed, the input description string would be: "rawkey lshift alt f2" To specify the key that produces an `a' (this may or may not be the A key depending on the keymap), with or without any Shift, Alt, or control keys pressed use: "-shift -alt -control a" For a mouse move with the right mouse button down, use: "rawmouse rbutton" To specify a timer event use: "timer" [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
