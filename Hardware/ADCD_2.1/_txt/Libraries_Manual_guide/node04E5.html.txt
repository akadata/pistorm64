TITLE: B / frameiclass / Attributes: IA_Recessed (IS)

B / frameiclass / Attributes: IA_Recessed (IS) ]" border=0> If this attribute is TRUE, a frameiclass object will appear recessed into the drawing surface. It does this by swapping its use of the SHADOWPEN and SHINEPEN. By default, the frame appears to be raised from the surface. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
