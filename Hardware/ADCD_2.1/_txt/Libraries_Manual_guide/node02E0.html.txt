TITLE: 23 / List Functions / Special Case Removal

23 / List Functions / Special Case Removal ]" border=0> The two functions RemHead() and RemTail() are used in combination with AddHead() and AddTail() to create special list ordering. When you combine AddTail() and RemHead(), you produce a first-in-first-out (FIFO) list. When you combine AddHead() and RemHead() a last-in-first-out (LIFO or stack) list is produced. RemTail() exists for symmetry. Other combinations of these functions can also be used productively. Both RemHead() and RemTail() remove a node from the list, and return a pointer to the removed node. If the list is empty, the function return a NULL result. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
