B Boopsi Class Reference / groupgclass ]" border=0> Class: groupgclass Superclass: gadgetclass Include File: gadgetclass.h > This is a class of objects that maintains an internal list of gadgets. Its purpose is to make it easier to layout a group of gadgets. Any gadgets that are a member of a groupgclass object are rendered relative to the groupgclass object's GA_Left and GA_Top attributes. As new gadgets are added to the groupgclass object, the groupgclass object's dimensions grow to enclose the new gadgets. When the groupgclass object receives an OM_DISPOSE message, it not only disposes of itself, it also disposes of all the gadgets in its list. Groupgclass does not support the gadget relative flags ( GA_RelWidth, GA_RelHeight, GA_RelBottom, and GA_RelRight ). New Methods: ------------ None. Changed Methods: ---------------- OM_SET GM_HITTEST OM_ADDMEMBER GM_RENDER OM_REMMEMBER GM_GOACTIVE/GM_GOINACTIVE/GM_HANDLEINPUT OM_DISPOSE Attributes: ----------- GA_Left, GA_Top (IS) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
