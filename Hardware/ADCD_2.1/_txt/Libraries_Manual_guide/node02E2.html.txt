TITLE: 23 / List Functions / Prioritized Insertion

23 / List Functions / Prioritized Insertion ]" border=0> The list functions discussed so far do not make use of the priority field in a Node . The Enqueue() function is equivalent to Insert() , except it inserts nodes into a list sorting them according to their priority. It keeps the higher-priority nodes towards the head of the list. All nodes passed to this function must have their priority and name assigned prior to the call. Enqueue( header ,mynode) inserts mynode behind the lowest priority node with a priority greater than or equal to mynode's. For Enqueue() to work properly, the list must already be sort according to priority. Because the highest priority node is at the head of the list, the RemHead() function will remove the highest-priority node. Likewise, RemTail() will remove the lowest-priority node. FIFO Is Used For The Same Priority. ----------------------------------- If you add a node that has the same priority as another node in the queue, Enqueue() will use FIFO ordering. The new node is inserted following the last node of equal priority. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
