28 / / Animation Components / Specifying Time for Each Image ]" border=0> The AnimComp members Timer and TimeSet are used to specify how long the system should keep each sequential image on the screen. When the system makes an animation component active, it copies the value you have put in the TimeSet member into the Timer member. As the animation proceeds, the system decrements Timer; as long as it is greater than zero, then that AnimComp remains active. When the Timer value reaches zero, the system makes the next AnimComp in the sequence active, and the process repeats. If you initialize the value in TimeSet to zero, the system will not sequence this component at all (and Timer will remain zero). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
