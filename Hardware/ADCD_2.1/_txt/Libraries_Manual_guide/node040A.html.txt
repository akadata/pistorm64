31 Commodities Exchange Library / Translate CxObjects ]" border=0> Normally, after a commodity processes a hot key input event, it needs to eliminate that input event. Other commodities may need to replace an input event with a different one. The translate CxObject can be used for these purposes. translateCxObj = CxObj *CxTranslate(struct InputEvent *newinputevent); The macro CxTranslate() creates a new translate CxObject . CxTranslate()'s only argument is a pointer to a chain of one or more InputEvent structures. When a translate CxObject receives a CxMessage , it eliminates the CxMessage and its corresponding input event from the system. The translator introduces a new input event, which Commodities Exchange copies from the InputEvent structure passed to CxTranslate() (newinputevent from the function prototype above), in place of the deleted input event. A translator is normally attached to some kind of filtering CxObject . If it wasn't, it would translate all input events into the same exact input event. Like the sender CxObject , a translator does not divert CxMessages down its personal list, so it doesn't serve any purpose to add any to it. void SetTranslate( CxObj *translator, struct InputEvent *ie ); It is possible to change the InputEvent structure that a translator looks at when it creates and introduces new input events into the input stream. The function SetTranslate() accepts a pointer to the new InputEvent structure, which the translator will duplicate and introduce when it receives a CxMessage . HotKey utilizes a special kind of translator. Instead of supplying a new input event, HotKey passes a NULL to CxTranslate() . If a translator has a NULL new input event pointer, it does not introduce a new input event, but still eliminates any CxMessages and corresponding input events it receives.
