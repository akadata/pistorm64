TITLE: 15 / GadTools Menus / The NewMenu Structure

15 / GadTools Menus / The NewMenu Structure ]" border=0> The NewMenu structure used to specify GadTools menus is defined in gadtools.h > as follows: struct NewMenu { UBYTE nm_Type; STRPTR nm_Label; STRPTR nm_CommKey; UWORD nm_Flags; LONG nm_MutualExclude; APTR nm_UserData; }; nm_Type The first field, nm_Type, defines what this particular NewMenu describes. The defined types provide an unambiguous and convenient representation of the application's menus. NM_TITLE Used to signify a textual menu heading. Each NM_TITLE signifies the start of a new menu within the menu strip. NM_ITEM or IM_ITEM Used to signify a textual (NM_ITEM) or graphical (IM_ITEM) menu item. Each NM_ITEM or IM_ITEM becomes a menu item in the current menu. NM_SUB or IM_SUB Used to signify a textual (NM_SUB) or graphical (IM_SUB) menu sub-item. All the consecutive NM_SUBs and IM_SUBs that follow a menu item (NM_ITEM or IM_ITEM) compose that item's sub-menu. A subsequent NM_ITEM or IM_ITEM would indicate the start of the next item in the original menu, while a subsequent NM_TITLE would begin the next menu. NM_END Used to signify the end of the NewMenu structure array. The last element of the array must have NM_END as its type. nm_Label NM_TITLE, NM_ITEM and NM_SUB are used for textual menu headers, menu items and sub-items respectively, in which case nm_Label points to the string to be used. This string is not copied, but rather a pointer to it is kept. Therefore the string must remain valid for the active life of the menu. Menus don't have to use text, GadTools also supports graphical menu items and sub-items (graphical menu headers are not possible since they are not supported by Intuition). Simply use IM_ITEM and IM_SUB instead and point nm_Label at a valid Image structure. The Image structure can contain just about any graphic image (see the chapter on " Intuition Images, Line Drawing and Text " for more on this). Sometimes it is a good idea to put a separator between sets of menu items or sub-items. The application may want to separate drastic menu items such as "Quit" or "Delete" from more mundane ones. Another good idea is to group related checkmarked items by using separator bars. NM_BARLABEL GadTools will provide a separator bar if the special constant NM_BARLABEL is supplied for the nm_Label field of an NM_ITEM or NM_SUB. nm_CommKey A single character string used as the Amiga-key equivalent for the menu item or sub-item. Menu headers cannot have command keys. Note that assigning a command-key equivalent to a menu item that has sub-items is meaningless and should be avoided. The nm_CommKey field is a pointer to a string and not a character itself. This was done in part because routines to support different languages typically return strings, not characters. The first character of the string is actually copied into the resulting MenuItem structure. nm_Flags The nm_Flags field of the NewMenu structure corresponds roughly to the Flags field of the Intuition's lower-level Menu and MenuItem structures. For programmer convenience the sense of the Intuition MENUENABLED and ITEMENABLED flags are inverted. When using GadTools, menus, menu items and sub-items are enabled by default. NM_MENUDISABLED To specify a disabled menu, set the NM_MENUDISABLED flag in this field. NM_ITEMDISABLED To disable an item or sub-item, set the NM_ITEMDISABLED flag. The Intuition flag bits COMMSEQ (indication of a command-key equivalent), ITEMTEXT (indication of a textual or graphical item) and HIGHFLAGS (method of highlighting) will be automatically set depending on other attributes of the menus. Do not set these values in nm_Flags. The nm_Flags field is also used to specify checkmarked menu items. To get a checkmark that the user can toggle, set the CHECKIT and MENUTOGGLE flags in the nm_Flags field. Also set the CHECKED flag if the item or sub-item is to start in the checked state. nm_MutualExclude For specifying mutual exclusion of checkmarked items. All the items or sub-items that are part of a mutually exclusive set should have the CHECKIT flag set. This field is a bit-wise representation of the items (or sub-items), in the same menu or sub-menu, that are excluded by this item (or sub-item). In the simple case of mutual exclusion, where each choice excludes all others, set nm_MutualExclude to ~(1 Intuition Menus " chapter for more details on menu mutual exclusion. nm_UserData The NewMenu structure also has a user data field. This data is stored with the Intuition Menu or MenuItem structures that GadTools creates. Use the macros GTMENU_USERDATA(menu) and GTMENUITEM_USERDATA(menuitem) defined in gadtools.h > to extract or change the user data fields of menus and menu items, respectively. The application may place index numbers in this field and perform a switch statement on them, instead of using the Intuition menu numbers. The advantage of this is that the numbers chosen remain valid even if the menus are rearranged, while the Intuition menu numbers would change when the menus are rearranged. Alternately, an efficient technique for menu handling is to create a handler function for each menu item and put a pointer to that function in the corresponding item's UserData field. When the program receives a IDCMP_MENUPICK message it may call the selected item's function through this field. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
