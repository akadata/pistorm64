TITLE: 4 Intuition Windows / Window Types

4 Intuition Windows / Window Types ]" border=0> There are three special window types: Backdrop, Borderless and GimmeZeroZero. Backdrop windows stay anchored to the back of the display. Borderless windows have no borders rendered by Intuition. GimmeZeroZero windows provide clipping to protect the borders from graphics rendered into the window. These window types can be combined, although the combinations are not always useful. For instance, a borderless, backdrop window can be created; however, a borderless, GimmeZeroZero window does not make sense. A window is not required to be any of these types.
