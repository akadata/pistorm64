TITLE: 12 / Creating a Boopsi Class / Building On Existing Public Classes

12 / Creating a Boopsi Class / Building On Existing Public Classes ]" border=0> A program can create its own subclasses which build on the features of existing classes. For example, a program could create a subclass of modelclass named rkmmodelclass. Rkmmodelclass builds on modelclass by adding a new attribute called RKMMOD_CurrVal. This purpose of this attribute is simply to hold an integer value. Because this new attribute is built into an rkmmodel object, the object could be implemented so that it exercises a certain amount of control over that value. For example, rkmmodelclass could be implemented so an rkmmodel performs bounds checking on its internal value. When an application asks an rkmmodel to set its internal RKMMOD_CurrVal, the rkmmodel makes sure the new value is not beyond a maximum value. If the new value is beyond the maximum, it sets its current value to the maximum. After the rkmmodelclass object has set its internal RKMMOD_CurrVal, it can broadcast the change on to objects in its broadcast list. The dispatcher for rkmmodelclass does not have to do a lot of work because it inherits most of its behavior from its superclasses. The rkmmodelclass has to take care of setting aside memory for the RKMMOD_CurrVal attribute and processing any OM_SET requests to set the RKMMOD_CurrVal attribute. For any other attributes or methods, the rkmmodelclass dispatcher passes on processing to its superclass, modelclass . Building Rkmmodelclass [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
