Amiga® RKM Libraries: 22 Exec Signals ]" border=0> Tasks often need to coordinate with other concurrent system activities (like other tasks and interrupts). This coordination is handled by Exec through the synchronized exchange of specific event indicators called signals. This is the primary mechanism responsible for all intertask communication and synchronization on the Amiga. This signal mechanism operates at a low level and is designed for high performance. Signals are used extensively by the Exec message system as a way to indicate the arrival of an inter-task message. The message system is described in more detail in the " Exec Messages and Ports " chapter. Not for Beginners. ------------------ This chapter concentrates on details about signals that most applications do not need to understand for general Amiga programming. For a general overview of signals, see the " Introduction to Exec " chapter of this manual. The Signal System Function Reference [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
