TITLE: 10 / The Keyboard / Amiga Qualifiers

10 / The Keyboard / Amiga Qualifiers ]" border=0> The Amiga keyboard has several special qualifiers which are listed in the next table. Most of these qualifiers are associated with special keys on the keyboard such as the Shift or Ctrl key. These keys are used to modify the meaning of other keys. Other qualifiers are associated with mouse button status. For a complete list of all the qualifiers, see the include file inputevent.h >. The Qualifier field of each IntuiMessage contains the status of all the qualifiers. An individual application should never attempt to track the state of any of the qualifier keys or mouse buttons even though key-down and key-up information may be available. Instead use the information available in the Qualifier field of the IntuiMessage structure. Table 10-3: Keyboard Qualifiers Qualifier Type Key Label Explanation --------- --------- ----------- Control Ctrl The IEQUALIFIER_CONTROL bit indicates that the Control key is depressed. Amiga Fancy A There are two Amiga keys, one on each side of the space bar. The left Amiga key is recognized by the Qualifier bit IEQUALIFIER_LCOMMAND, and the right Amiga key by IEQUALIFIER_RCOMMAND. Alternate Alt There are two separate Alt keys, one on each side of the space bar, next to the Amiga keys. These can be treated separately, if desired. The left Alt key sets the IEQUALIFIER_LALT bit and the right Alt key sets the IEQUALIFIER_RALT bit. Shift Up Arrow There are two separate Shift keys, one above each Alt key. These can be treated distinctly, if desired. The left Shift key sets the IEQUALIFIER_LSHIFT bit and the right Shift key sets the IEQUALIFIER_RSHIFT bit. Caps Lock Caps Lock The IEQUALIFIER_CAPSLOCK bit is set as long as the Caps Lock light is illuminated. Numeric Pad The IEQUALIFIER_NUMERICPAD bit is set for keys on the numeric keypad. Repeat Repeat key events are sent with the IEQUALIFIER_REPEAT bit set. Mouse Buttons If mouse buttons are down when the event occurs, one or more of the three bits IEQUALIFIER_LEFTBUTTON, IEQUALIFIER_MIDBUTTON or IEQUALIFIER_RBUTTON will be set.
