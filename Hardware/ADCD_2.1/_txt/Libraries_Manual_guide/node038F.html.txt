28 / / Displaying the VSprites / Loading the New View ]" border=0> Now that the display instructions include the definition of the VSprites, the system can display this newly configured View with the LoadView() function: struct View *view; LoadView(view); Again, view is a pointer to the View that contains the the new Copper instruction list (if you are using GELs in an Intuition Screen, do not call LoadView() .) The Copper instruction lists are double-buffered, so this instruction does not actually take effect until the next display field occurs. This avoids the possibility of some function trying to update the Copper instruction list while the Copper is trying to use it to create the display. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
