TITLE: Amiga® RKM Libraries: 8 Intuition Images, Line Drawing and Text

Amiga® RKM Libraries: 8 Intuition Images, Line Drawing and Text ]" border=0> Intuition supports two general approaches to creating images, lines, and text in displays: through Intuition library calls and through graphics library calls. This chapter explains the use of Intuition structures and functions for creating display imagery. The Intuition graphical functions provide a high level interface to the graphics library, giving the application quick and easy rendering capabilities. As with any high level calls, some power and flexibility is sacrificed in order to provide a simple interface. For more flexibility and control over the graphics, the application can directly call functions in the graphics library as discussed in the " Graphics Primitives " chapter. Intuition also has additional features for defining custom graphic objects. See the " BOOPSI " chapter for more information on these objects.
