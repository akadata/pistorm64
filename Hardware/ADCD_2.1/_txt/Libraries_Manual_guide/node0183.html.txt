TITLE: 6 / Setting Up Menus / Disabling Menu Operations

6 / Setting Up Menus / Disabling Menu Operations ]" border=0> If an application does not use menus at all, it may set the WFLG_RMBTRAP flag, which allows the program to trap right mouse button events for its own use. By setting the WFLG_RMBTRAP flag with the WA_Flags tag when the window is opened, the program indicates that it does not want any menu operations at all for the window. Whenever the user presses the right button while this window is active, the program will receive right button events as normal IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS events. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
