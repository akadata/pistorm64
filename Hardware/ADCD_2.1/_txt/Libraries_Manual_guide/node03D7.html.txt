29 / The Text Function / Setting the Text Drawing Attributes ]" border=0> In addition to SetFont() , there are three rastport control functions that set attributes for text rendering: void SetAPen( struct RastPort *rp, ULONG pen ); void SetBPen( struct RastPort *rp, ULONG pen ); void SetDrMd( struct RastPort *rp, ULONG drawMode ); The color of the text depends upon the rastport's current drawing mode and pen colors. You set the draw mode with the SetDrMd() function passing it a pointer to a rastport and a drawing mode: JAM1 , JAM2 , COMPLEMENT or INVERSEID . If the drawing mode is JAM1 , the text will be rendered in the RastPort.FgPen color. Wherever there is a set bit in the character's bitmap image, Text() will set the corresponding bit in the rastport to the FgPen color. This is known as overstrike mode. You set the FgPen color with the SetAPen() function by passing it a pointer to the rastport and a color number. If the drawing mode is set to JAM2 , Text() will place the FgPen color as in the JAM1 mode, but it will also set the bits in the rastport to the RastPort.BgPen color wherever there is a corresponding cleared bit in the character's bitmap image. Basically, this prints the character themselves in the FgPen color and fills in the surrounding parts of the character image with the BgPen color. You set the BgPen color with the SetBPen() function by passing it a pointer to the rastport and a color number. If the drawing mode is COMPLEMENT , for every bit set in the character's bitmap image, the corresponding bits in the rastport (in all of the rastport's bitplanes) will have their state reversed. cleared bits in the character's bitmap image have no effect on the destination rastport. As with the other drawing modes, the write mask can be used to protect certain bitplanes from being modified (see the " graphics primitives " chapter for more details). The JAM1 , JAM2 , and COMPLEMENT drawing modes are mutually exclusive of each other but each can be modified by the INVERSVID drawing mode. If you combine any of the drawing modes with INVERSVID, the Amiga will reverse the state of all the bits in the source drawing area before writing anything into the rastport. The idea of using a RastPort structure to hold all the rendering attributes is convenient if the rastport's drawing attributes aren't going to change much. This is not the case where several processes need to render into a rastport using very different drawing attributes. An easy way around this problem is to clone the RastPort. By making an exact duplicate of a RastPort, you can change the various rendering parameters of your RastPort without effecting other programs that render into the RastPort you cloned. Because a RastPort only contains a pointer to the rendering area (the bitmap), the original RastPort and the cloned RastPort both render into the bitmap, but they can use different drawing parameters (font, drawing mode, colors, etc.).
