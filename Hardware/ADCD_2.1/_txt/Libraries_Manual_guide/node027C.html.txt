16 / Creating a File Requester / Specifying Options with TagItems ]" border=0> Both AllocAslRequest() and AslRequest() accept a TagItem array or tag list as an argument. The tag list is used to initialize or alter the values in the requester data structure. A single TagItem consists of a tag name and an associated tag value. Tag items that apply to the asl.library are defined in asl.h >. The basic tag items (used in the first example listed below) are: Requester Tag Name Used For --------- -------- ASL_Hail String to place in the title bar of the requester window ASL_Width Requester window width ASL_Height Requester window height ASL_LeftEdge Requester window y origin ASL_TopEdge Requester window x origin ASL_OKText String to place in OK gadget of requester ASL_CancelText String to place in Cancel gadget of requester ASL_File Default file name (for file requesters only) ASL_Dir Default directory name (for file requesters only) Note that you are currently limited to about six characters for the replacement text if you use either the ASL_OKText or ASL_CancelText tags to change the text that appears in the OK and Cancel gadgets. The contents of an ASL requester data structure are preserved across calls to AslRequest() . So, until the requester is freed, tag settings and user selections will remain in the data structure unless they are altered by tags in subsequent calls to AslRequest(). This is very useful because it allows the requester to remember and redisplay the user's previous selections. However, this also means that the programmer must assure that any addresses passed in ASL tags remain valid, or are refreshed on each call to AslRequest(). Generally, options that you wish to specify only once, such as the initial position and size, should be specified as tags when you allocate the requester. Options that you wish to control for each use of the requester should be passed as tags each time the requester is opened with AslRequest() . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
