TITLE: B / gadgetclass / Changed Methods: OM_NOTIFY

B / gadgetclass / Changed Methods: OM_NOTIFY ]" border=0> This method tells a gadget to send an OM_UPDATE message to its target object. Boopsi gadgets have a function similar to icclass objects--each gadget can have an ICA_TARGET and ICA_MAP in order to notify some target object of attribute changes. When a Boopsi gadget sends an OM_NOTIFY message, it always includes its GA_ID. This makes it easy for an application to tell which gadget initially sent the OM_NOTIFY. See the description of icclass's OM_NOTIFY and OM_UPDATE and the rootclass 's OM_NOTIFY and OM_UPDATE methods for more details. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
