TITLE: 19 Exec Device I/O / Devices With Functions

19 Exec Device I/O / Devices With Functions ]" border=0> Some devices, in addition to their commands, provide library-style functions which can be directly called by applications. These functions are documented in the device specific FD files and Autodocs of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs , and in the Devices volume of this manual set. Devices with functions behave much like Amiga libraries, i.e., you set up a base address pointer and call the functions as offsets from the pointer. See the " Exec Libraries " chapter for more information. The procedure for accessing a device's functions is as follows: * Declare the device base address variable in the global data area. The correct name for the base address can be found in the device's FD file. * Create a message port data structure. * Create an I/O request data structure. * Call OpenDevice() , passing the I/O request. If OpenDevice() is successful (returns 0), the address of the device base may be found in the io_Device field of the I/O request structure. Consult the include file for the structure you are using to determine the full name of the io_Device field. The base address is only valid while the device is open. * Set the device base address variable to the pointer returned in the io_Device field. We will use the timer device to illustrate the above method. The name of the timer device base address is listed in its FD file as TimerBase. #include timer.h > struct Library *TimerBase; /* device base address pointer */ struct MsgPort *TimerMP; /* message port pointer */ struct timerequest *TimerIO; /* I/O request pointer */ if (TimerMP=CreatePort(NULL,NULL)) /* Create the message port. */ { /* Create the I/O request. */ if ( TimerIO = (struct timerequest *) CreateExtIO(TimerMP,sizeof(struct timerequest)) ) { /* Open the timer device. */ if ( !(OpenDevice(TIMERNAME,UNIT_MICROHZ,TimerIO,0)) ) { /* Set up pointer for timer functions. */ TimerBase = (struct Library *)TimerIO->tr_node.io_Device; /* Use timer device library-style functions such as /* /* CmpTime() ...*/ CloseDevice(TimerIO); /* Close the timer device. */ } else printf("Error: Could not open %s\n",TIMERNAME); } else printf("Error: Could not create I/O request\n"); } else printf("Error: Could not create message port\n"); } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
