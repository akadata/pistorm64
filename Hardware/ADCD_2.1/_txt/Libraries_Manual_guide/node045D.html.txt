TITLE: 33 IFFParse Library / IFF FORM Specifications

33 IFFParse Library / IFF FORM Specifications ]" border=0> The specifications for Amiga IFF formats are maintained by Commodore Applications and Technical Support ( CATS ) and updated periodically. The latest specifications are published in the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices (3rd edition) and also available in electronic form directly from CATS. Between updates of the IFF Manual, selected new FORMs and changes to existing FORMs are documented in Amiga Mail a technical newsletter for Amiga developers published by Commodore's CATS group. Some of the most commonly used IFF FORMs are the four that were originally specified in the EA IFF-85 standard: ___________________________________ | | | ILBM Bitmap images and palettes | | FTXT Simple formatted text | | SMUS Simple musical scores | | 8SVX 8-bit sound samples | |___________________________________| Of these four, ILBM is the most commonly encountered FORM, and FTXT is becoming increasingly important since the Release 2 conclip command passes clipped console text through the clipboard as FTXT. All data clipped to the clipboard must be in an IFF format. This section will provide a brief summary of the ILBM and FTXT FORMs and their most used common chunks. Please consult the EA-IFF specifications for additional information. FORM ILBM FORM FTXT [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
