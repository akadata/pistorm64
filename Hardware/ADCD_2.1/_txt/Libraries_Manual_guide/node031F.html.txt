TITLE: 27 / Introduction / Role of the Copper (Coprocessor)

27 / Introduction / Role of the Copper (Coprocessor) ]" border=0> The Amiga has a special-purpose coprocessor, called the Copper, that can control nearly the entire graphics system. The Copper can control register updates, reposition sprites, change the color palette, and update the blitter. The graphics and animation routines use the Copper to set up lists of instructions for handling displays, and advanced programmers can create their own custom Copper lists.
