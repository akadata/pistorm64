TITLE: 23 / List Functions / List Macros for Assembly Language Programmers

23 / List Functions / List Macros for Assembly Language Programmers ]" border=0> Assembly language programmers may want to optimize their code by using assembly code list macros. Because these macros actually embed the specified list operation into the code, they result in slightly faster operations. The file lists.i > contains the recommended set of macros. For example, the following instructions implement the REMOVE macro: MOVE.L LN_SUCC(A1),A0 ; get successor MOVE.L LN_PRED(A1),A1 ; get predecessor MOVE.L A0,LN_SUCC(A1) ; fix up predecessor's succ pointer MOVE.L A1,LN_PRED(A0) ; fix up successor's pred pointer [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
