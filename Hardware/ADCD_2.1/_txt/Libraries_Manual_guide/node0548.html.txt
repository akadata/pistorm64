TITLE: D / Errors / Fails only on Newer ROMs or Newer WB

D / Errors / Fails only on Newer ROMs or Newer WB ]" border=0> This should not happen with proper programming. Possible causes include: running too close to your stack limits or the memory limits of a base machine (newer versions of the operating system may use slightly more stack in system calls, and usually use more free memory); using system functions improperly; not testing function return values; improper register or condition code handling in assembler code. Remember that result, if any, is returned in D0, and condition codes and D1/A0/A1 are undefined after a system call; using improperly initialized pointers; trashing memory; assuming something (such as a flag) is B if it is not A; failing to initialize formerly reserved structure fields to zero; violating Amiga programming guidelines (for example: depending on or poking private system structures, jumping into ROM, depending on undocumented or unsupported behaviors); failure to read the function Autodocs. See Appendix E, " Release 2 Compatibility ", for more information on 2.0 compatibility problem areas. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
