TITLE: 34 / Keymap Functions / Asking For the Default Keymap

34 / Keymap Functions / Asking For the Default Keymap ]" border=0> The AskKeyMapDefault() returns a pointer to the current default keymap. To use the mapping functions in keymap.library it is normally not necessary to call this function. They accept NULL as equivalent to 'use default keymap' and will call this function for you. You can use this pointer for example to cache the system default in order to temporarily change the keymap your applications uses, or find the keymap in the keymap.resource list of loaded keymaps. You should never change the system wide default keymap unless the user asks you to do so; since the Amiga is a multitasking system, changing the keymap could interfere with the behaviour of other applications.
