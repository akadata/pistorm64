TITLE: 33 IFFParse Library / Parsing an IFF File

33 IFFParse Library / Parsing an IFF File ]" border=0> Chunk reading requires a parser to scan each chunk and dispatch the proper access/conversion procedure. For a simple IFF file, such parsing may be relatively easy, consisting mainly reading in the data of desired chunks, and seeking over unwanted chunks (and the pad byte after odd-length chunks). Interpreting nested chunks is more complex, and requires a method for keeping track of the current context, i.e., the data which is still relevant at any particular depth into the nest. The original IFF specifications compare an IFF file to a C program. Such a metaphor can be useful in understanding the scope of of the chunks in an IFF file. The IFFParse library addresses general IFF parsing requirements by providing a run-time library which can extract the chunks you want from an IFF file, with the ability to pass control to you when it reaches a chunk that requires special processing such as decompression. IFFParse also understands complex nested IFF formats and will keep track of the context for you. Basic Functions and Structures of IFFParse Library [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
