9 / Intuition Input / Intuition as an Input Handler ]" border=0> Intuition is an input handler linked into the input stream, and it monitors and modifies events that it receives. The input arrives at Intuition as a single stream of events. These events are filtered, altered, and enhanced by Intuition, then dispatched to windows as appropriate, or passed down to input handlers lower in the chain. If the active window has a console attached to it, then it can receive the input events that are still left in the stream, which can include some events that Intuition played a role in forming. Many kinds of input event undergo little conversion by Intuition. For instance, raw keyboard events are not modified by Intuition (with the exception of a few keystrokes that have special meaning). Other events may produce differing results based on Intuition's view of the system. For example, when the mouse select button is pressed, the event may become a gadget down-press event, a window activation event, or it may remain a simple button press, depending on the mouse position and the arrangement of windows and screens. Still other events are consumed by Intuition, and the application is not directly notified. An example would be when the select button is pressed over a system gadget. Intuition is also the originator of certain kinds of events. For example, a window-refreshing event is generated when Intuition discovers that part of a window is in need of redrawing. This might have resulted indirectly from some other input (for example, the user might have dragged a window), but not necessarily (the refresh might have been necessitated by a program bringing a window to the front).
