15 / / The Kinds of GadTools Gadgets / Cycle Gadgets ]" border=0> Like mutually exclusive gadgets, cycle gadgets (CYCLE_KIND) allow the user to choose exactly one option from among several. The cycle gadget appears as a raised rectangular button with a vertical divider near the left side. A circular arrow glyph appears to the left of the divider, while the current choice appears to the right. Clicking on the cycle gadget advances to the next choice, while shift-clicking on it changes it to the previous choice. Cycle gadgets are more compact than mutually exclusive gadgets, since only the current choice is displayed. They are preferable to mutually exclusive gadgets when a window needs to have several such gadgets as in the PrinterGfx Preferences editor, or when there is a medium number of choices. If the number of choices is much more than about a dozen, it may become too frustrating and inefficient for the user to find the desired choice. In that case, use a listview (scrolling list) instead. The tags recognized by cycle gadgets are: GTCY_Labels (STRPTR *) Like GTMX_Labels , this tag is associated with a NULL-pointer-terminated array of strings which are the choices that this gadget allows. This array must be supplied to CreateGadget() , and can only be changed starting in V37. The strings themselves must remain valid for the lifetime of the gadget. (Create only (V36), Create and set (V37).) GTCY_Active (UWORD) The ordinal number, counting from zero, of the active choice of the cycle gadget. The default is zero. (Create and set.) GA_Disabled (BOOL) (New for V37, ignored by V36.) Set this attribute to TRUE to disable the cycle gadget, to FALSE otherwise. The default is FALSE. (Create and set.) When the user clicks or shift-clicks on a cycle gadget, the program will receive an IDCMP_GADGETUP IntuiMessage. Look in the Code field of the IntuiMessage for the ordinal number of the new active selection. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
