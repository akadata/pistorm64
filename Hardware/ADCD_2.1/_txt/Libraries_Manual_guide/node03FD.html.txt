30 / / Changing a Region / Regions and Regions ]" border=0> As with rectangles and regions, there are four layers library functions for combining regions with regions: BOOL AndRegionRegion( struct Region *srcRegion, struct Region *destRegion ); BOOL OrRegionRegion ( struct Region *srcRegion, struct Region *destRegion ); BOOL XorRegionRegion( struct Region *srcRegion, struct Region *destRegion ); void ClearRegion ( struct Region *region ); AndRegionRegion() performs a logical and operation on the two regions, leaving the result in the second region. The operation leaves drawable areas wherever the regions drawable areas overlap. That is, where there are drawable areas in both region 1 and region 2, there will be drawable areas left in the result region. OrRegionRegion() performs a logical or operation on the two regions, leaving the result in the second region. The operation leaves drawable areas wherever there are drawable areas in either region. That is, where there are drawable areas in either region 1 or region 2, there will be drawable areas left in the result region. XorRegionRegion() performs a logical exclusive-or operation on the two regions, leaving the result in the second region. The operation leaves drawable areas wherever there are drawable areas in either region but not both. That is, where there are drawable areas in either region 1 or region 2, there will be drawable areas left in the result region. But where there are drawable areas in both region 1 and region 2, there will not be drawable areas left in the result region. ClearRegion() puts the region back to the same state it was in when the region was created with NewRegion() , that is, no areas are drawable. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
