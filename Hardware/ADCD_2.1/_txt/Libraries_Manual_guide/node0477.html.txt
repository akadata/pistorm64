34 / Keymap Functions / Dead-Class Keys ]" border=0> All of the national keymaps, including USA, contain dead-class keys. This term refers to keys that either modify or can themselves be modified by other dead-class keys. There are two types of dead-class keys: dead and deadable. A dead key is one which can modify certain keys pressed immediately following. For example, on the German keyboard there is a dead key marked with the grave accent (`). The dead key produces no console output, but when followed by (for instance) the A key, the combination will produce the a-grave (à) character (National Character Code $E0). On the U.S. keyboard, Alt-G is the deadkey used to add the grave accent (`) to the next appropriate character typed. A deadable key is one that can be prefixed by a dead key. The A key in the previous example is a deadable key. Thus, a dead key can only affect the output of a deadable key. For any key that is to have a dead-class function, whether dead or deadable, the qualifier KCF_DEAD flag must be included in the entry for the key in the KeyMapTypes table. The KCF_DEAD type may also be used in conjunction with the other qualifiers. Furthermore, the key's keymap table entry must contain the longword address of the key's dead-key descriptor data area in place of the usual 4 ASCII character mapping. Below is an excerpt from the Amiga 1000 German key map which is referred to in the following discussion. KMLowMapType: DC.B KCF_DEAD+KC_VANILLA ; aA (Key 20) ... ; (more...)

Both keys use the addresses of their descriptor data areas as entries in the LoKeyMap table. The LoKeyMapTypes table says that there are four qualifiers for both: the requisite KCF_DEAD , as well as KCF_SHIFT , KCF_ALT , and KCF_CONTROL . The number of qualifiers determine length and arrangement of the descriptor data areas for each key. The next table shows how to interpret the KeyMapTypes for various combinations of the qualifier bits. For each possible position a pair of bytes is needed. The first byte in each pair tells how to interpret the second byte (more about this below). Table 34-5: Dead Key Qualifier Bits _______________________________________________________________ | | | | | Then the pair of bytes in this position | | | in the dead-class key descriptor data is | | If type is: | output when the key is pressed along with: | |_________________|_____________________________________________| | | | | | | | | | | | NOQUAL | alone | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | |-----------------|-------|---|---|-----|---|-----|-----|-------| | A | alone | A | - | - | - | - | - | - | |-----------------|-------|---|---|-----|---|-----|-----|-------| | C | alone | C | - | - | - | - | - | - | |-----------------|-------|---|---|-----|---|-----|-----|-------| | S | alone | S | - | - | - | - | - | - | |-----------------|-------|---|---|-----|---|-----|-----|-------| | A+C | alone | A | C | A+C | - | - | - | - | |-----------------|-------|---|---|-----|---|-----|-----|-------| | A+S | alone | S | A | A+S | - | - | - | - | |-----------------|-------|---|---|-----|---|-----|-----|-------| | C+S | alone | S | C | C+S | - | - | - | - | |-----------------|-------|---|---|-----|---|-----|-----|-------| | S+A+C (VANILLA) | alone | S | A | S+A | C | C+S | C+A | C+S+A | |_________________|_______|___|___|_____|___|_____|_____|_______| | | | The abbreviations A, C, S stand for KCF_ALT , KCF_CONTROL , and | | KCF_SHIFT , respectively. Also note that the ordering is | | reversed from that in the normal KeyMap table. | |_______________________________________________________________| Because keys 20 and 25 each use three qualifier bits (not including KCF_DEAD ), according to the table there must be 8 pairs of data, arranged as shown. Had only KCF_ALT been set, for instance, (not including KCF_DEAD), just two pairs would have been needed. As mentioned earlier, the first byte of each data pair in the descriptor data area specifies how to interpret the second byte. There are three possible values: 0, DPF_DEAD and DPF_MOD . In the Amiga 1000 German keymap listed above, DPF_DEAD appears in the data for key 25, while DPF_MOD is used for key 20. It is the use of these flags that determines whether a dead-class key has dead or deadable function. A value of zero causes the unrestricted output of the following byte. If the flag byte is DPF_DEAD , then that particular key combination (determined by the placement of the pair of bytes in the data table) is dead and will modify the output of the next key pressed (if deadable). How it modifies is controlled by the second byte of the pair which is used as an index into part(s) of the data area for ALL the deadable ( DPF_MOD set) keys. Before going further, an understanding of the structure of a descriptor data area wherein DPF_MOD is set for one (or more) of its members is necessary. Referring to the example, we see that DPF_MOD is set for the first and second pairs of bytes. According to its LoKeyMapTypes entry, and using table 34-5 (Dead Key Qualifier Bits) as a guide, these pairs represent the alone and SHIFTed values for the key. When DPF_MOD is set, the byte immediately following the flag must be the offset from the start of the key's descriptor data area to the start of a table of bytes describing the characters to output when this key combination is preceded by any dead keys. This is where the index mentioned above comes in. The value of the index from a prefixing dead key is used to determine which of the bytes from the deadable keys special table to output. The byte in the index+1 position is sent out. (The very first byte is the value to output if the key was not prefixed by a dead key.) Thus, if Alt-H is pressed (dead) and then Shift-A, an `a' with a circumflex (^) accent will be output. This is because: * The byte pair for the ALT position of the H key (key 25) is DPF_DEAD ,3 so the index is 3. * The byte pair for the SHIFT position of the A key (key 20) is DPF_MOD , key20s-key20, so we refer to the table-of-bytes at key20s. * The third+1 byte of the table-of-bytes is $C2, an `a' character. A Note About Table Size. ------------------------ The number of bytes in the table-of-bytes for all deadable keys must be equal to the highest index value of all dead keys plus 1.
