TITLE: B / gadgetclass / New Methods: GM_GOINACTIVE

B / gadgetclass / New Methods: GM_GOINACTIVE ]" border=0> This method tells the active gadget to become inactive. The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. GM_GOINACTIVE uses a custom message structure (defined in gadgetclass.h >): struct gpGoInactive { ULONG MethodID; /* GM_GOINACTIVE */ struct GadgetInfo *gpgi_GInfo; /* V37 field only! DO NOT attempt to read under V36! */ ULONG gpgi_Abort; /* gpgi_Abort=1 if gadget was */ /* aborted by Intuition and 0 if */ /* gadget went inactive at its */ /* own request. */ }; The gpgi_Abort field contains either a 0 or 1. If it is 0, the gadget became inactive at its own request (because the GM_HANDLEINPUT method returned something besides GMR_MEACTIVE ). If gpgi_Abort is 1, Intuition aborted this active gadget. Some cases where Intuition aborts a gadget include: the user clicked in another window or screen, an application removed the active gadget with RemoveGList() , and an application called ActivateWindow() on a window other than the gadget's window. If the gadget allocated any resources to cache or precalculate information in the GM_GOACTIVE method, it should deallocate those resources in this method. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
