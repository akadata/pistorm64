TITLE: B / gadgetclass / New Methods: GM_GOACTIVE

B / gadgetclass / New Methods: GM_GOACTIVE ]" border=0> This method asks a gadget if it is OK to make it the active gadget. The active gadget is the gadget that is currently receiving user input. Intuition sends this message after a gadget responds affirmatively to the GM_HITTEST method. A gadget becomes active because it needs to process input events (like a prop gadget or string gadget). Some types of gadget do not need to become active. These gadgets do not have to process input from the user, they only have to deal with a single mouse click to toggle their state. Because that mouse click triggered this method, the button already has all of the user input it requires. Note that the behavior of the GadTools button differs from a Boopsi buttongclass gadget, which processes other input events besides a single mouse click. See the entry for buttongclass in this Appendix for more details. GM_GOACTIVE uses a custom message structure (defined in gadgetclass.h >): struct gpInput { ULONG MethodID; /* GM_GOACTIVE or GM_HANDLEINPUT */ struct GadgetInfo *gpi_GInfo; struct InputEvent *gpi_IEvent; /* The input event that triggered */ /* this method (can be NULL for */ /* GM_GOACTIVE). */ LONG *gpi_Termination; /* For GADGETUP IntuiMessage.Code */ struct { WORD X; /* Mouse position relative to upper */ WORD Y; /* left corner of gadget (LeftEdge, */ } gpi_Mouse; /* TopEdge). */ }; The gpi_IEvent field points to the struct InputEvent that triggered the GM_GOACTIVE message. If gpi_IEvent is NULL, the GM_GOACTIVE message was triggered by a function like intuition.library's ActivateGadget() and not by the user clicking the gadget. For gadgets that only want to become active as a direct result of a mouse click, this difference is important. For example, the prop gadget becomes active only when the user clicks on its knob. Because the only way the user can control the prop gadget is via the mouse, it would not make sense for it to be activated by anything besides the mouse. On the other hand, a string gadget gets input from the keyboard, so a string gadget doesn't care what activates it. Its input comes from the keyboard rather than the mouse. A gadget's GM_GOACTIVE method returns GMR_MEACTIVE (defined in gadgetclass.h >) if it wants to be the active gadget. Otherwise it returns GMR_NOREUSE . For a description of what these values mean, See their description in the gadgetclass 's GM_HANDLEINPUT method, below. If necessary, a gadget's GM_GOACTIVE method can precalculate and cache information before it becomes the active gadget. The gadget will use this information while it's processing user input with the GM_HANDLEINPUT method. When it is time for the active gadget to become inactive, Intuition will send the gadget a GM_GOINACTIVE message. The gadget can clean up its precalculations and cache in the GM_GOINACTIVE method. For more information on GM_GOINACTIVE, see its description below. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
