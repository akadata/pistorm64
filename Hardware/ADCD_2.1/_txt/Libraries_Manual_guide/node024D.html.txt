15 / Elements of GadTools / GadTools Tags ]" border=0> Many of the GadTools functions use TagItem arrays or tag lists to pass information across the function interface. These tag-based functions come in two types, one that takes a pointer to an array of tag items and one that takes a variable number of tag item arguments directly in the function call. In general, the second form, often called the varargs form because the call takes a variable number of arguments, is provided for convenience and is internally converted to the first form. When looking through the Autodocs or other Amiga reference material, the documentation for both forms is usually available in the array-based function description. All GadTools tags begin with a leading "GT". In general, they also have a two-letter mnemonic for the kind of gadget in question. For example, slider gadgets recognize tags such as " GTSL_Level ". The GadTools tags are defined in gadtools.h >. Certain GadTools gadgets also recognize other Intuition tags such as GA_Disabled and PGA_Freedom, which can be found in gadgetclass.h >. For more information on tags and tag-based functions, be sure to see the " Utility Library " chapter in this manual. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
