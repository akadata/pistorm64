TITLE: 1 / / Design Decisions / Conditional Code

1 / / Design Decisions / Conditional Code ]" border=0> Conditional code provides a second way to take advantage of Release 2 enhancements in a 1.3-compatible application. The basic idea is to add low overhead conditional code, based on library version, to make use of selected Release 2 features if they are available. There are some powerful and beneficial Release 2 features which are definitely worth conditional code. The control flow for such conditional code is always based on whether a particular version of a library is available. Failure of OpenLibrary() (i.e., return value of NULL) means that the library version requested is not available. The version number of a library that successfully opened can be checked by testing LibBase->lib_Version. Always check for a version greater or equal to the version you need. Examples of conditional library checking code: /* Checking for presence of a new Release 2 library */ if( AslBase = OpenLibrary("asl.library", 37L) ) { /* OK to use the ASL requester */ } else { /* Must use a different method */ } /* Check version of an existing library with new Release 2 features */ if(GfxBase->lib_Version >= 37) { /* then allow new genlock modes */} [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
