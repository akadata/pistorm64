TITLE: 5 Intuition Gadgets / Gadget Enabling and Disabling

5 Intuition Gadgets / Gadget Enabling and Disabling ]" border=0> A gadget may be disabled so that it cannot be chosen by the user. When a gadget is disabled, its image is ghosted. A ghosted gadget is overlaid with a pattern of dots, thereby making the imagery less distinct. The dots are drawn into the select box of the gadget and any imagery that extends outside of the select box is not affected by the ghosting. The application may initialize whether a gadget is disabled by setting the GFLG_DISABLED flag in the Gadget structure's Flags field before a gadget is submitted to Intuition. Clear this flag to create an enabled gadget. After a gadget is submitted to Intuition for display, its current enable state may be changed by calling OnGadget() or OffGadget() . If the gadget is in a requester, the requester must currently be displayed when calling these functions. void OnGadget ( struct Gadget *gadget, struct Window *window, struct Requester *requester ); void OffGadget( struct Gadget *gadget, struct Window *window, struct Requester *requester ); Depending on what sort of imagery you choose for your gadget, OnGadget() may not be smart enough to correct the gadget's displayed imagery. See the section on " Updating a Gadget's Imagery " for more details. Multiple gadgets may be enabled or disabled by calling OnGadget() or OffGadget() for each gadget, or by removing the gadgets with RemoveGList() , setting or clearing the GFLG_DISABLED flag on each, replacing the gadgets with AddGList() , and refreshing with RefreshGList() .
