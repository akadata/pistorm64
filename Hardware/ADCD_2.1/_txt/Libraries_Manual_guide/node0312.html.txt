TITLE: 27 / Introduction / Components of a Display

27 / Introduction / Components of a Display ]" border=0> In producing a display, you are concerned with two primary components: sprites and the playfield. Sprites are the easily movable parts of the display. The playfield is the static part of the display and forms a backdrop against which the sprites can move and with which the sprites can interact. This chapter covers the creation of the background. Sprites are described in the " Graphics Sprites, Bobs and Animation " chapter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
