TITLE: 35 Math Libraries / IEEE Single-Precision Transcendental Math Library

35 Math Libraries / IEEE Single-Precision Transcendental Math Library ]" border=0> The IEEE single-precision transcendental math library was introduced in V36. It contains entries for transcendental math functions such as sine, cosine, and square root. This library resides on disk and is opened by calling OpenLibrary() with "mathieeesingtrans.library" as the argument. Do not share the library base pointer between tasks -- see note at beginning of chapter. #include #include struct Library *MathIeeeSingTransBase; #include VOID main() { if (MathIeeeSingTransBase = OpenLibrary("mathieeesingtrans.library",37)) { . . . CloseLibrary(MathIeeeSingTransBase); } else printf("Can't open mathieeesingtrans.library\n"); } The global variable MathIeeeSingTransBase is used internally for all future library references. The IEEE single-precision transcendental math library is dependent upon the IEEE single-precision basic math library, which it will open if it is not open already. If you want to use the IEEE single-precision basic math functions in conjunction with the transcendental math functions however, you have to specifically open the basic math library yourself. Just as the IEEE single-precision basic math library, the IEEE single-precision transcendental math library will take advantage of a 680X0/68881 combination or another math resource, if present.
