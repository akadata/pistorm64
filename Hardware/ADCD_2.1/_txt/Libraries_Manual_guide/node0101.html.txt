4 / About Windows / The Active Window ]" border=0> There is only one window in the system active at any time. The active window receives all user input, including keyboard and mouse events. This is also known as the input focus, as all input is focused at this single point. Some areas of the active window are displayed more boldly than those on inactive windows. The active window's borders are filled in with a color which is designed to stand out from the background while inactive windows have their borders filled with the background color. The specific coloring of active and inactive windows is dependent on the screen on which the window is opened. See the section " DrawInfo and the 3D Look " in the "Intuition Screens" chapter for more information. Windows have two optional titles: one for the window and one for the screen. The window title appears in the top border of the window, regardless of whether the window is active or inactive. The window's screen title appears in the screen's title bar only when the window is active. This gives the user a secondary clue as to what application is active in the screen. The active window's menus are displayed on the screen when the right mouse button (the menu button ) is pressed. If the active window has no menus, then none will be displayed. Each window may also have its own mouse-pointer image. Changing the active window will change the pointer to the one currently set for the new active window. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
