Amiga® RKM Libraries: 30 Layers Library ]" border=0> This chapter describes the layers library which provides routines that are used to manage overlapping rectangular drawing areas that share a common display. Intuition uses the layers library to manage its system of windows. The chapter also describes the use of regions, special structures used to mask off areas where drawing can take place. Regions are installed through the layers library function InstallClipRegion() but the routines for the creation, disposal and manipulation of regions are part of the graphics library.
