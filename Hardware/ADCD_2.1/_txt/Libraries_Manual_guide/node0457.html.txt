TITLE: 33 / Advanced Topics / Custom Chunk Handlers

33 / Advanced Topics / Custom Chunk Handlers ]" border=0> Like custom stream handlers, custom chunk handlers are implemented using Release 2 Hook structures. See the previous section for details on how a handler function may be interfaced using a Hook structure. There are two types of chunk handlers: entry handlers and exit handlers. Entry handlers are invoked just after the parser enters the chunk; the stream will be positioned to read the first byte in the chunk. (If the chunk is a FORM , LIST , CAT , or PROP , the longword type will be read by the parser; the stream will be positioned to read the byte immediately following the type.) Exit handlers are invoked just before the parser leaves the chunk; the stream is not positioned predictably within the chunk.
