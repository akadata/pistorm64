TITLE: 28 / Animation with GELs / Animations Special Numbering System

28 / Animation with GELs / Animations Special Numbering System ]" border=0> Velocities and accelerations can be either positive or negative. The system treats the velocity, acceleration and Ring values as fixed-point binary fractions, with the decimal point at position 6 in the word. That is: vvvvvvvvvv.ffffff where v stands for actual values that you add to the x or y ( AnX, AnY ) positions of the object for each call to Animate() , and f stands for the fractional part. By using a fractional part, you can specify the speed of an object in increments as precise as 1/64th of an interval. If you set the value of XVel at 0x0001, it will take 64 calls to the Animate() routine before the system will modify the object's x coordinate position by a step of one. The system constant ANFRACSIZE can be used to shift values correctly. So if you set the value to (1 Animate() simply adds the value of XAccel to the current value of XVel , and YAccel to the current value of YVel , modifying these values accordingly.
