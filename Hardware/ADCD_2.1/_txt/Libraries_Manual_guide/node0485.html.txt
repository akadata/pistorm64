TITLE: 35 Math Libraries / IEEE Single-Precision Basic Math Library

35 Math Libraries / IEEE Single-Precision Basic Math Library ]" border=0> The ROM-based IEEE single-precision basic math library was introduced in V36. This library contains entries for the basic IEEE single-precision mathematics functions, such as add, subtract, and divide. (Note, registered developers can license a disk-based version of this library from CATS , for usage with V33). The library is opened by making calling OpenLibrary() with "mathieeesingbas.library" as the argument. Do not share the library base pointer between tasks -- see note at beginning of chapter for details. #include #include #include struct Library *MathIeeeSingBasBase; VOID main() { /* do not share base pointer between tasks. */ if (MathIeeeSingBasBase = OpenLibrary("mathieeesingbas.library", 37)) { . . . CloseLibrary(MathIeeeSingBasBase); } else printf("Can't open mathieeesingbas.library\n"); } The global variable MathIeeeSingBasBase is used internally for all future library references. If an 680X0/68881/68882 processor combination is available, it will be used by the IEEE single-precision basic library instead of the software emulation. Also, if an autoconfigured math resource is available, that will be used. Typically this is a 68881 designed as a 16 bit I/O port, but it could be another device as well.
