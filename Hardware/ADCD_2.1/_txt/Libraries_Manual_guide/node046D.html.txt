34 / Keymap Functions / Mapping Key Codes To ANSI Strings ]" border=0> MapRawKey() is converts raw key codes to ANSI characters based on a default or supplied keymap. WORD MapRawKey(struct InputEvent *inputevent, UBYTE *buffer, WORD bufferlength, struct Keymap *keymap); MapRawKey() takes an IECLASS_RAWKEY inputevent, which may be chained, and converts the key codes to ANSI characters which are placed in the specified buffer. If the buffer would overflow, for example because a longer string is attached to a key, -1 will be returned. If no error occurred, MapRawKey() will return the number of bytes written in the buffer. The keymap argument can be set to NULL if the default keymap is to be used for translation, or can be a pointer to a specific KeyMap structure. The following example shows how to implement the MapRawKey() function. maprawkey.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
