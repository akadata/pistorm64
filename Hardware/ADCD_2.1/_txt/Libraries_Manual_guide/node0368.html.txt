27 / / Performing Data Move Operations / When to Wait for the Blitter ]" border=0> This section explains why you might have to call WaitBlit() , a special graphics function that suspends your task until the blitter is idle. Many of the calls in the graphics library use the Amiga's hardware blitter to perform their operation, most notably those which render text and images, fill or pattern, draw lines or dots and move blocks of graphic memory. Internally, these graphics library functions operate in a loop, doing graphic operations with the blitter one plane at a time as follows: OwnBlitter(); /* Gain exclusive access to the hardware blitter */ for(planes=0; planes depth; planes++) { WaitBlit(); /* Sleep until the previous blitter operation */ /* completes start a blit */ } DisownBlitter(); /* Release exclusive access to the hardware blitter */ Graphics library functions that are implemented this way always wait for the blitter at the start and exit right after the final blit is started. It is important to note that when these blitter-using functions return to your task, the final (or perhaps only) blit has just been started, but not necessarily completed. This is efficient if you are making many such calls in a row because the next graphics blitter call always waits for the previous blitter operation to complete before starting its first blit. However, if you are intermixing such graphics blitter calls with other code that accesses the same graphics memory then you must first WaitBlit() to make sure that the final blit of a previous graphics call is complete before you use any of the memory. For instance, if you plan to immediately deallocate or reuse any of the memory areas which were passed to your most recent blitter-using function call as a source, destination, or mask, it is imperative that you first call WaitBlit(). Warning: -------- If you do not follow the above procedure, you could end up with a program that works correctly most of the time but crashes sometimes. Or you may run into problems when your program is run on faster machines or under other circumstances where the blitter is not as fast as the processor. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
