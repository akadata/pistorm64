TITLE: 27 / / Viewport Size Specifications / ViewPort Width

27 / / Viewport Size Specifications / ViewPort Width ]" border=0> The DWidth variable in the ViewPort structure determines how wide, in pixels, the display segment will be. To set your ViewPort to the maximum supported (displayable) NTSC high-resolution width, use the following fragment (this requires Release 2): struct DimensionInfo querydims; struct Rectangle *oscan; struct ViewPort viewport; /* Use PAL_MONITOR_ID instead of NTSC_MONITOR_ID to get PAL */ /* dimensions */ if (GetDisplayInfoData( NULL,(UBYTE *)&querydims, sizeof(querydims), DTAG_DIMS, NTSC_MONITOR_ID|HIRES_KEY )) { /* Use StdOScan instead of MaxOScan to get standard */ /* overscan dimensions as set by the user in Overscan */ /* Preferences */ oscan = &querydims.MaxOScan; viewPort->DWidth = oscan->MaxX - oscan->MinX + 1; } You may specify a smaller value of pixels per line to produce a narrower display segment or simply set ViewPort.DWidth to the nominal value for this resolution. Although the system software allows you define low-resolution displays as wide as 362 pixels and high-resolution displays as wide as 724 pixels, you should use caution in exceeding the normal values of 320 or 640, respectively. Because display overscan varies from one monitor to another, many video displays will not be able to show all of a wider display, and sprite display may also be affected. However, if you use the standard overscan values ( DimensionInfo.StdOScan ) provided by the Release 2 function GetDisplayInfoData() as shown above, the user's preference for the size of the display will be satisfied. If you are using hardware sprites or VSprites with your display, and you specify ViewPort widths exceeding 320 or 640 pixels (for low or high-resolution, respectively), it is likely that some hardware sprites will not be properly rendered on the screen. These sprites may not be rendered because playfield DMA (direct memory access) takes precedence over sprite DMA when an extra-wide display is produced. See the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual for a more complete description of this phenomenon. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
