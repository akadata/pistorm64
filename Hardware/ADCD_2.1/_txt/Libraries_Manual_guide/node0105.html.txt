4 / Basic Window Structures and Functions / Closing Windows ]" border=0> Call the CloseWindow() function to close a window, remove its imagery from the display, and clean up any system resources used by the window. Typically, you call CloseWindow() when Intuition informs you that the user has selected the window's close gadget but this is not a requirement nor does the window have to be active to be closed. void CloseWindow( struct Window *window ); Pass this function a pointer to the Window structure returned by one of the OpenWindow() calls. If you call CloseWindow() on the active window, the previously active window (if available) will become the active window. If the previously active window has already closed, then the window active prior to that window will become the active window. (Applications should not rely on this behavior. To make a specific window become active, call the ActivateWindow() function.) Intuition does not automatically close a window when the user selects the close window gadget. Instead, Intuition sends your program a message about the user's action. The program can then perform whatever cleanup is necessary before closing the window with the CloseWindow() function.
