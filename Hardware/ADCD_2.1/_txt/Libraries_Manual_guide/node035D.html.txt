27 / / Using Drawing Routines / Ellipse and Circle-fill Operations ]" border=0> Two functions are associated with drawing filled ellipses: AreaCircle() and AreaEllipse() . AreaCircle() (a macro that calls AreaEllipse()) will draw a circle from the specified center point using the specified radius. This function is executed by the statement: AreaCircle(&rastPort, center_x, center_y, radius); Similarly, AreaEllipse() draws a filled ellipse with the specified radii from the specified center point: AreaEllipse(&rastPort, center_x, center_y, horiz_r, vert_r); Outlining with SetOPen() is not currently supported by the AreaCircle() and AreaEllipse() routines. Caution: -------- If you attempt to fill an area outside the bounds of the BitMap , using the basic initialized RastPort , it may crash the system. You must either do your own software clipping to assure that the area is in range, or use the layers library. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
