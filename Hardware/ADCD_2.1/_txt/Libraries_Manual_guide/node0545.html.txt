TITLE: D / Errors / Fails only on 68020/30

D / Errors / Fails only on 68020/30 ]" border=0> The following programming practices can cause this problem: using the upper bytes of addresses as flags; doing signed math on addresses; self-modifying code; using the MOVE SR assembler instruction (use Exec GetCC() instead); software delay loops; assumptions about the order in which asynchronous tasks will finish. The following differences in 68020/30 can cause problems: data and/or instruction caches must be flushed if data or code is changed by DMA or other non-processor modification; different exception stack frame; interrupt autovectors may be moved by VBR; 68020/30 CLR instruction does a single write access unlike the 68000 CLR instruction which does a separate read and write access (this might affect a read-triggered register in I/O space--use MOVE instead).
