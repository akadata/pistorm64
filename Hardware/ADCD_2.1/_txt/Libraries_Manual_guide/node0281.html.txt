TITLE: 16 ASL Library / Creating a Font Requester

16 ASL Library / Creating a Font Requester ]" border=0> The ASL library also contains a font requester. Using the font requester is very similar to using the file requester. First, allocate a requester structure with AllocAslRequest() or AllocAslRequestTags() . The type should be set to ASL_FontRequest in order to get a FontRequester structure: struct FontRequester { APTR fo_Reserved1[2]; struct TextAttr fo_Attr; /* Returned TextAttr */ UBYTE fo_FrontPen; /* Returned pens, if selected */ UBYTE fo_BackPen; UBYTE fo_DrawMode; APTR fo_UserData; /* missing from asl.h but present in this structure */ SHORT fo_LeftEdge, fo_TopEdge, fo_Width, fo_Height; }; Once the requester is set up, call AslRequest() or AslRequestTags() to make the requester appear on screen. These functions return TRUE if the user makes a selection. In that case, the font selected is returned as a TextAttr structure in the fo_Attr field of the FontRequester structure. (The TextAttr structure is defined in text.h >. See the Amiga ROM Kernel Manual: Includes and Autodocs for a complete listing.) If the user cancels the font requester FALSE is returned. Figure 16-2: The ASL Font Requester When the requester is no longer needed, call FreeAslRequest() to deallocate the requester data structure.
