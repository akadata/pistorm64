33 / Advanced Topics / Custom Stream Handlers ]" border=0> As discussed earlier, IFFParse contains built-in stream handlers for AmigaDOS file handles as returned by Open() , and for the clipboard.device. If you are using AmigaDOS filehandles or the clipboard.device, you need not supply a custom stream handler. If you wish to use your compiler's own file I/O functions (such as fread() ) or need to read or write to an unusual handler or Exec device, you must provide a custom stream handler for your IFFHandle . Your custom stream handler will be called to perform all reads, writes, and seeks on your custom stream. The allows you to use compiler file I/O functions, Exec device commands, or any other method to perform the requested stream operations. If you are implementing your own custom stream handler, you will need to know the mechanics of hook call-backs, and how to interpret the parameters. An IFFParse custom stream handler is simply a function in your code that follows Release 2 hook function conventions (Hook functions are also known as callback functions. See the " Utility Library " chapter for more details). Installing a Custom Stream Handler Inside a Custom Stream Handler [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
