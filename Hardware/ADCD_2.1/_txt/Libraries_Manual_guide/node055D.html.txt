D Troubleshooting Guide / A Final Word About Testing ]" border=0> Test your program with memory watchdog and invalidation tools on a wide variety of systems and configurations. Programs with coding errors may appear to work properly on one or more configurations, but may fail or cause fatal problems on another. Make sure that your code is tested on both a 68000 and a 68020/30, on machines with and without Fast RAM, and on machines with and without enhanced chips. Test all of your program functions on every machine. Test all error and abort code. A program with missing error checks or unsafe cleanup might work fine when all of the items it opens or allocates are available, but may fail fatally when an error or problem is encountered. Try your code with missing files, filenames with spaces, incorrect filenames, cancelled requesters, Ctrl-C, missing libraries or devices, low memory, missing hardware, etc. Test all of your text input functions with high-ASCII characters (such as the character produced by pressing Alt-F then "A"). Note that RAWKEY codes can be different keyboard characters on national keyboards (higher levels of keyboard input are automatically translated to the proper characters). If your program will be distributed internationally, support and take advantage of the additional screen lines available on a PAL system. Enhanced Agnus chip machines may be switched to be PAL or NTSC via motherboard jumper J102 in A2000s and jumper J200 in A3000s. Note that a base PAL machine will have less memory free due to the larger display size. Write good code. Test it. Then make it great. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
