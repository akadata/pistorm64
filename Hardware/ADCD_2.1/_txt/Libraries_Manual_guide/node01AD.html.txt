TITLE: 7 / Easy Requesters / The EasyStruct Structure

7 / Easy Requesters / The EasyStruct Structure ]" border=0> The text and setup of an easy requester is specified in an EasyStruct structure, defined in intuition.h >. struct EasyStruct { ULONG es_StructSize; ULONG es_Flags; UBYTE *es_Title; UBYTE *es_TextFormat; UBYTE *es_GadgetFormat; }; es_StructSize Contains the size of the EasyStruct structure, sizeof(struct EasyStruct). es_Flags Set to zero. es_Title Title of easy requester window. If this is NULL, the title will be taken to be the same as the title of the reference window, if one is specified in the EasyRequest() call, else the title will be "System Request". es_TextFormat Format string for the text in the requester body, with printf() -style variable substitution as described in the Exec library function RawDoFmt() . Multiple lines are separated by the linefeed character (hex 0x0a or `\n' in C). Formatting `%' functions are supported exactly as in RawDoFmt(). The variables that get substituted in the format string come from the last argument passed to EasyRequest() (see prototype above). es_GadgetFormat Format string for gadgets, where the text for separate gadgets is separated by `|' (vertical bar). As with the body text, printf() -style formatting with variable substitution is supported, but multi-line text in the gadgets is not supported. At least one gadget must be specified. Requesters generated with EasyRequest() and BuildEasyRequest() (including system requesters, which use SysReqHandler() to handle input) can be satisfied by the user via the keyboard. The key strokes left Amiga V and left Amiga B correspond to selecting the requester's leftmost or rightmost gadgets with the mouse, respectively. An easy request must have at least one choice. Multiple choices are specified through the "|" (vertical bar) separator character in the es_GadgetFormat string. The buttons are displayed evenly spaced, from left-to-right in the order in which they appear in the string. The requesters generated by EasyRequest() appear in the visible portion of the specified screen. They do not cause the screen to scroll. Under the current implementation, the window for an easy requester will appear in the upper left corner of the display clip for the specified screen. When a request is posted using EasyRequest() or BuildEasyRequest() , it will move the screen it appears on to the front, if that screen is not already the frontmost. This brings the request to the attention of the user. The request also comes up as the active window and could potentially steal the input focus from the current window. When the request is satisfied the screen will be moved to back if the request caused the screen to move to the front when it was displayed. Note that the final screen position may not be the same as the original screen position. Example Using EasyRequest() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
