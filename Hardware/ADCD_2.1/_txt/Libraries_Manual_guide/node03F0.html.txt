30 / / Creating and Using New Layers / Creating a Viewing Workspace ]" border=0> A viewing workspace may be created by using the primitives InitVPort() , InitView() , MakeVPort() , MrgCop() , and LoadView() . Please reference the " Graphics Primitives " chapter for details on creating a low-level graphics display. Do not create Layers directly on Intuition screens.
