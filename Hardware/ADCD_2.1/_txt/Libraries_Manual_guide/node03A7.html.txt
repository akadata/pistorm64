28 / Using Bobs / Sorting and Displaying Bobs ]" border=0> As with VSprites, the GelsInfo list must be sorted before any Bobs can be displayed. This is accomplished with the SortGList() function. For Bobs, the system uses the position information to decide inter-Bob priorities, if not explicitly set by using the Bob.Before and Bob.After pointers. Once the GelsInfo list has been sorted, the Bobs in the list can be displayed by calling DrawGList() . This call should then be followed by a call to WaitTOF() if the application wants to be sure that the Bobs are rendered before proceeding. Call these functions as follows: struct RastPort myRastPort = {0}; /* Of course, these have to be */ struct ViewPort myViewPort = {0}; /* initialized... */ SortGList(&myRastPort); DrawGList(&myRastPort, &myViewPort);/* Draw the elements (Bobs only) */ WaitTOF(); Warning: -------- If your GelsInfo list contains VSprites in addition to Bobs, you must also call MrgCop() and LoadView() to make all the GELs visible. Or, under Intuition, RethinkDisplay() must be called to make all the GELs visible. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
