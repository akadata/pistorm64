30 / Layers / The Layer Structure ]" border=0> The internal representation of layers is essentially a set of clipping rectangles. Each layer is represented by an instance of the Layer structure. All the layers in a display are linked together through the Layer_Info structure. Any display shared by multiple layers (such as an Intuition screen) requires one Layer_Info data structure to handle interactions between the various layers. Here is a partial listing of the Layer structure from clip.h >. (For a complete listing refer to the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs.) struct Layer { struct Layer *front,*back; struct ClipRect *ClipRect; /* read ROMs to find 1st cliprect */ struct RastPort *rp; struct Rectangle bounds; ... UWORD Flags; /* obscured ?, Virtual BitMap? */ struct BitMap *SuperBitMap; ... struct Region *DamageList; /* list of rectangles to refresh */ /* through */ }; The Layer Structure is Read-Only. --------------------------------- Applications should never directly modify any of the elements of the Layer structure. In addition, applications should only read the front, back, rp, bounds, Flags, SuperBitMap and DamageList elements of the Layer structure. (Some of these elements are subject to dynamic change by the system so proper layer locking procedures must be followed when relying on what the application has read.) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
