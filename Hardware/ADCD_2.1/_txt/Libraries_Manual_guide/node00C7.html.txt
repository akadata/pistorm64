2 Intuition and the Graphical User Interface / About User Interfaces ]" border=0> What is a user interface? This sweeping phrase covers all aspects of communication between the user and the computer. It includes the innermost mechanisms of the computer and rises to the height of defining a philosophy to guide the interaction between human and machine. Intuition is, above all else, a philosophy turned into software. Intuition's user interface philosophy is simple to describe: the interaction between the user and the computer should be consistent, simple and enjoyable; in a word, intuitive. Intuition supplies the tools needed to turn this philosophy into practice. Implicit in this philosophy is the idea that the user interface should be graphical. A graphical user interface, or GUI, is a visually oriented method of communicating with a computer in which system resources are represented by pictorial symbols that can be manipulated with a pointing device such as a mouse . Other types of user interfaces are possible such as the Amiga's Shell in which text commands are entered by typing them at the keyboard.
