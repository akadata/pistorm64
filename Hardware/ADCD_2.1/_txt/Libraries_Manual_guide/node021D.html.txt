12 / / The Boopsi Gadget Methods / GM_GOINACTIVE ]" border=0> After an active gadget deactivates, Intuition sends it a GM_GOINACTIVE message (defined in gadgetclass.h >): struct gpGoInactive { ULONG MethodID; /* GM_GOINACTIVE */ struct GadgetInfo *gpgi_GInfo; /* V37 field only! DO NOT attempt to read under V36! */ ULONG gpgi_Abort; /* gpgi_Abort=1 if gadget was */ /* aborted by Intuition */ /* and 0 if gadget went inactive */ /* at its own request. */ }; The gpgi_Abort field contains either a 0 or 1. If 0, the gadget became inactive on its own power (because the GM_GOACTIVE or GM_HANDLEINPUT method returned something besides GMR_MEACTIVE ). If gpgi_Abort is 1, Intuition aborted this active gadget. Some instances where Intuition aborts a gadget include: the user clicked in another window or screen, an application removed the active gadget with RemoveGList(), and an application called ActiveWindow() on a window other than the gadget's window.
