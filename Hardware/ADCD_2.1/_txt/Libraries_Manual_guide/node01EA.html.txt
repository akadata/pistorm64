10 / The Mouse / Mouse Usage Example ]" border=0> The example program below shows the use of IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS , IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE and DoubleClick() . DoubleClick() is used to test the interval between two times and determine if the interval is within the user specified time for double clicking as set in the Preferences Input editor. BOOL DoubleClick( unsigned long sSeconds, unsigned long sMicros, unsigned long cSeconds, unsigned long cMicros ); The sSeconds and sMicros arguments specify a timestamp value describing the start of the double click time interval to be tested. The cSeconds and cMicros arguments specify a timestamp value describing the end of the double click time interval to be tested. DoubleClick() returns TRUE if the time interval was short enough to qualify as a double-click. A FALSE return indicates that the time interval between presses took too long. The button presses should be treated as separate events in that case. mousetest.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
