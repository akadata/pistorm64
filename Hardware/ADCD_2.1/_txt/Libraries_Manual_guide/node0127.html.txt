TITLE: 4 / Other Window Functions / Menus and the Active Window

4 / Other Window Functions / Menus and the Active Window ]" border=0> Menus for the active window will be displayed when the user presses the menu button on the mouse. Menus may be disabled for the window by not providing a menu strip, or by clearing the menus with ClearMenuStrip() . Similarly, if the active window has WFLG_RMBTRAP set, the menu button will not bring up the menus. Two other functions, SetMenuStrip() and ResetMenuStrip() , are used to attach or update the menu strip for a window. void ClearMenuStrip( struct Window *window ); BOOL SetMenuStrip( struct Window *window, struct Menu *menu ); BOOL ResetMenuStrip( struct Window *window, struct Menu *menu ); If SetMenuStrip() has been called for a window, ClearMenuStrip() must be called before closing the window. After ClearMenuStrip() has been called, the user can no longer access menus for this window. See the chapter " Intuition Menus ," for complete information about setting up menus.
