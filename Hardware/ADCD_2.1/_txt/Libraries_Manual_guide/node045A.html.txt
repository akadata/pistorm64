33 / / Custom Chunk Handlers / The Object Parameter ]" border=0> The object parameter supplied to EntryHandler() and ExitHandler() is a pointer which will be passed to your handler when invoked. This pointer can be anything; the parser doesn't use it directly. As an example, you might pass the pointer to the IFFHandle . This way, when your handler is called, you'll be able to easily perform operations on the IFFHandle within your handler. Such code might appear as follows: error = EntryHandler (iff, ID_ILBM, ID_BMHD, IFFSLI_ROOT, hook, iff); And your handler would be declared as follows: /* Registerized handler hook h_Entry using */ /* SAS C registerized parameters */ LONG __asm MyHandler (register __a0 struct Hook *hook, register __a1 LONG *cmd, register __a2 struct IFFHandle *iff) /* Standard args handler hook h_SubEntry using */ /* HookEntry.asm as Hook h_Entry */ LONG MyHandler ( struct Hook *hook, LONG *cmd, struct IFFHandle *iff ) From within your handler, you could then call CurrentChunk() , ReadChunkBytes() , or nearly any other operation on the IFFHandle . Please refer to the EntryHandler() and ExitHandler() Autodocs for additional information on the use of chunk handlers. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
