28 / / Detecting Gel Collisions / Preparing for Collision Detection ]" border=0> Before you can use the system to detect collisions between GELS, you must allocate and initialize a table of collision-detection routines and place the address of the table in the GelsInfo.CollHandler field. This table is an array of pointers to the actual routines that you have provided for your collision types. You must also prepare some members of the VSprite structure: CollMask , BorderLine , HitMask , and MeMask . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
