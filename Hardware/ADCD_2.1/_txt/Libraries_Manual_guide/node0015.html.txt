1 / / Operating System Versions / About Release 2 ]" border=0> Release 2 first appeared on the Amiga 3000. This initial version corresponds to Kickstart V2.00, system library version number V36. Release 2 was subsequently revised and this older version is now considered obsolete. Programs written for Release 2 should use only the later version corresponding to Kickstart V2.04, system library version number V37. If your system is using the earlier version of Release 2, you should upgrade your system. (Upgrade kits may be obtained from an authorized Amiga service center.) _____________________________________________________________________ | | | What Every Amiga Programmer Should Know: | | ---------------------------------------- | | Some libraries or specific functions are not available in older | | versions of the Amiga operating system.
