TITLE: B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_DRAWFRAME

B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_DRAWFRAME ]" border=0> The IM_DRAWFRAME method instructs an image object to render itself within the confines of a given rectangle. The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. This method uses a custom message structure that is basically an extension of the IM_DRAW message: struct impDraw { ULONG MethodID; /* IM_DRAWFRAME */ struct RastPort *imp_RPort; /* RastPort to render into */ struct { WORD X; /* X and Y offset relative to the */ WORD Y; /* image's IA_Left and IA_Top attributes */ } imp_Offset; ULONG imp_State; /* Visual state of image (see defines below)*/ struct DrawInfo *imp_DrInfo; /* DrawInfo describing target RastPort (can be NULL) */ struct { WORD Width; /* scale, clip, restrict, etc. to these bounds */ WORD Height; } imp_Dimensions; }; The Width and Height fields provide the object's rectangular bounds. How the image object deals with the frame is implementation specific. If the imageclass dispatcher sees this message, it will convert it to an IM_DRAW message and send it back to the image's true class. An image subclass which assigns proper meaning to this method (i.e., frameiclass ) should handle this method itself. This method is useful to classes of images that can scale or clip themselves to arbitrary dimensions. Typically, an instance of a class that truly supports this method will massage its imagery as best it can to fit into the rectangle. In general, applications that use this method to draw an object should use the IM_ERASEFRAME method to erase it (see below). This will ensure that the image erases itself at the proper scale.
