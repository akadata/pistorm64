D / Errors / Fails only on machines with Fast RAM ]" border=0> Data and buffers which will be accessed directly by the custom chips must be in Chip RAM. This includes bitplanes (use OpenScreen() or AllocRaster() ), audio samples, trackdisk buffers, and the graphic image data for sprites, pointers, bobs, images, gadgets, etc. Use compiler or linker flags to force Chip RAM loading of any initialized data needing to be in Chip RAM, or dynamically allocate Chip RAM and copy any initialization data there.
