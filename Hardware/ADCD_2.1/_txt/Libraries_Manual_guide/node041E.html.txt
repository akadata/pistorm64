32 / / ROM Based and Autoboot Drivers / Events At BOOT Time ]" border=0> If there is no boot disk in the internal floppy drive, the system strap module will call a routine to perform autoboot . It will examine the eb_MountList ; find the highest priority BootNode structure at the head of the List; validate the BootNode; determine which ConfigDev is associated with this BootNode; find its DiagArea ; and call its da_BootPoint function in the ROM "image" to bootstrap the appropriate DOS. Generally, the BootPoint code of a ROM driver will perform the same function as the boot code installed on a floppy disk, i.e., it will FindResident() the dos.library, and jump to its RT_INIT vector. The da_BootPoint call, if successful, should not return. If a boot disk is in the internal floppy drive, the system strap will Enqueue() a BootNode on the eb_MountList for DF0: at the suggested priority (see the Autodoc for the expansion.library AddDosNode() function). Strap will then open AmigaDOS, overriding the autoboot . AmigaDOS will boot from the highest priority node on the eb_MountList which should, in this case, be DF0:. Thus, games and other bootable floppy disks will still be able to obtain the system for their own use. In the event that there is no boot disk in the internal floppy drive and there are no ROM bootable devices on the autoconfiguration chain, the system does the normal thing, asking the user to insert a Workbench disk, and waiting until its request is satisfied before proceeding.
