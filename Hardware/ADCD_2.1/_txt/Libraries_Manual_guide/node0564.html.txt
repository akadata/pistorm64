TITLE: E / Release 2 Changes That Can Affect Compatibility / DOS

E / Release 2 Changes That Can Affect Compatibility / DOS ]" border=0> * DOS is now written in C and assembler, not BCPL. The BCPL compiler artifact which caused D0 function results to also be in D1 is gone. System patches in Release 2 that return some DOS function results in both D0 and D1 are not guaranteed to remain in the next release. Fix your programs! Use Scratch to find these problems in your code. * DOS now has a real library base with normal LVO vectors. * Stack usage has all changed (variables, direction). * New packet and lock types. Make sure you are not passing stack garbage for the second argument to Lock() . * Process structure is bigger. "Rolling your own" Process structure from a Task fails. Use dos.library System() or CreateNewProc() . * Unless documented otherwise, you must be a process to call DOS functions. DOS function dependence on special process structures can change with OS revisions. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
