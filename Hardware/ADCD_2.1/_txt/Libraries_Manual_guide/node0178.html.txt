TITLE: Amiga® RKM Libraries: 6 Intuition Menus

Amiga® RKM Libraries: 6 Intuition Menus ]" border=0> Menus are command and option lists associated with an application window that the user can bring into view at any time. These lists provide the user with a simple way to access features of the application without having to remember or enter complex character-based command strings. The Intuition menu system handles all of the menu display without intervention from the application. The program simply submits an initialized list of data structures to Intuition and waits for menu events. This chapter shows how to set up menus that allow the user to choose from your program's commands and options.
