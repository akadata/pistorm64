28 / Using Virtual Sprites / Specification of VSprite Structure ]" border=0> The VSprite structure is defined in the include file gels.h > as follows: /* VSprite structure definition */ struct VSprite { struct VSprite *NextVSprite; struct VSprite *PrevVSprite; struct VSprite *DrawPath; struct VSprite *ClearPath; WORD OldY, OldX; WORD Flags; WORD Y, X; WORD Height; WORD Width; WORD Depth; WORD MeMask; WORD HitMask; WORD *ImageData; WORD *BorderLine; WORD *CollMask; WORD *SprColors; struct Bob *VSBob; BYTE PlanePick; BYTE PlaneOnOff; VUserStuff VUserExt; }; There are two primary ways to allocate and fill in space for VSprite data. They can be statically declared, or a memory allocation function can be called and they can be filled in programmatically. The declaration to statically set up a VSprite structure is listed below. /* VSprite static data definition. ** must set the following for TRUE VSprites: ** VSPRITE flag. ** Width to 1. ** Depth to 2. ** VSBob to NULL. */ struct VSprite myVSprite = { NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, VSPRITE, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 0, 0, &myImage, 0, 0, &mySpriteColors, NULL, 0x3, 0, 0 }; This static allocation gives the required VSprite structure, but does not allocate or set up collision masks for the VSprite. Note that the VSprite structure itself does not need to reside in Chip memory. Refer to the makeVSprite() and freeVSprite() functions in the animtools.c listing at the end of the chapter for an example of dynamically allocating, initializing and freeing a VSprite structure.
