6 / / The Menu System / Menu Item Imagery ]" border=0> Menu items can be graphic images or text. There is no conceptual difference between menus that display text and menus that display images, in fact, the two techniques may be used together. The examples in this chapter use text based menus to avoid the extra code required to define images. When the user positions the pointer over an item, the item can be highlighted through a variety of techniques. These techniques include a highlighted box around the selected item, complementing the entire item and replacing the item with an alternate image or alternate text. Attribute items can have an image rendered next to them, usually a checkmark, to indicate whether they are in effect or not. The checkmark is positioned to the left of the item. If the checkmark is present, the attribute is on. If not, the attribute is off. On the right side of menu items, command key alternatives may be displayed. Command key alternatives allow the user to make menu selections with the keyboard instead of the mouse. This is done by holding down the right Amiga key and then pressing the single character command key alternative listed next to the menu item. Command key alternatives appear as a reverse video, fancy "A", followed by the single character command key. Menu items or whole menus may be enabled or disabled. Disabling an item prevents the user from selecting it. Disabled items are ghosted (overwritten with a pattern of dots making the image less distinct) in order to distinguish them from enabled items. Menu help, a new feature of Release 2, allows the application to be notified when the user presses the help key at the same time the menu system is activated. This allows applications to provide a help feature for every item in its menus. Menu help may be requested on any level of a menu. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
