9 Intuition Input and Output Methods / Overview of System I/O ]" border=0> This section provides a very simplified model of how Amiga I/O and application programs interact. The main elements of the Amiga's I/O system are shown in the diagram below. Input events begin when mouse movement is detected by the gameport device or key presses are received by the keyboard device. These and other input events are merged into a single stream by the input device, which then submits the stream to Intuition for further processing. Figure 9-1: Amiga Input Block Diagram The application program can receive its input from Intuition or the Console device. The application may choose to listen to neither, one or both of these input sources. Figure 9-2: Amiga Output Block Diagram An application's display output can go through the high level interfaces of the console device or through the Intuition library. Additionally, display output may be sent directly to the graphics library. Notice that both the Console and Intuition call the graphics library to render to the display.
