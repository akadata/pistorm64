TITLE: E Release 2 Compatibility / General Compatibility Problem Areas

E Release 2 Compatibility / General Compatibility Problem Areas ]" border=0> The following improper Amiga programming practices are likely to fail on new ROMs or hardware. * Requiring all free RAM. * Overwriting memory allocations. With 32-bit addresses, a 1-byte overwrite of a string array can wipe out the high byte of a pointer or stack return address. This bug could go unnoticed on a 24-bit address machine (e.g., A500) but crash the system or cause other problems on an A3000. * Improper flags or garbage in system structures. A bit that means nothing under one OS may drastically change the behavior of a function in a newer version of the OS. Clear structures before using, and use correct flags. * Misuse of function return values. Use function prototypes and read the Autodocs for the functions you are using. Some system functions return just success or failure, or nothing at all (void). In such cases, the value which the function happens to return must not be used except as it is documented. * Depending on unsupported side effects or undocumented behavior. Be sure to read the Autodocs, include file comments and other documentation. * Assuming current choices, configurations or initial values. If the current possibilities are A, B, or C, do not assume C if it isn't A or B. Check specifically for the choices currently implemented, and provide default behavior for unexpected values. Amiga debugging tools such as Enforcer, Mungwall and Scratch can find many program bugs that may affect compatibility. A program that is Enforcer/Mungwall/Scratch clean stands a much better chance of working well under current and future versions of the OS. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
