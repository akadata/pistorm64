TITLE: 10 / / Custom Pointer / The Sprite Data Structure

10 / / Custom Pointer / The Sprite Data Structure ]" border=0> To define the pointer, set up a sprite data structure (sprites are one of the general purpose Amiga graphics structures). The sprite image data must be located in Chip memory, which is memory that can be accessed by the special Amiga hardware chips. Expansion, or Fast memory cannot be addressed by the custom chips. Ensure that data is in Chip memory by using the AllocMem() function with the MEMF_CHIP flag, and copying the data to the allocated space. Alternately, use the tools or flags provided by each compiler for this purpose. See the " Exec Memory Allocation " chapter for more information. A sprite data structure is made up of words of data. In a pointer sprite, the first two words and the last two words are reserved for the system and should be set to zero. All other words contain the sprite image data. The pointer in the example, a standard busy pointer, is sixteen lines high and sixteen pixels wide. Currently, all sprites are two bit planes deep, with one word of data for each line of each plane. The example sprite image consists of 36 words (2 planes x 18 lines = 36 words). Add to this the four reserved words of control information for a total of 40 words of data. See the example below for the complete data definition. The sprite data words are combined to determine which color will appear at each pixel position of each row of the sprite. The first two words of image data, 0x0400 and 0x07C0, represent the top line of the sprite. The numbers must be viewed as binary numbers and combined in a bit-wise fashion. The highest bit from each word are combined to form a two bit number representing the color register for the leftmost pixel. The next two bits represent the next pixel in the row, and so on, until the low order bits from each word represent the rightmost pixel in the row. For example: Hex Binary --- ------ Second word 0x07C0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 First word 0x0400 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \________/\_/\_______/\___________/ | | | | | | | | | | | `-- 00 = color 0 | | | | | `-- 10 = color 2 | | | `-- 11 = color 3 | `-- 00 = color 0 Pointer Color Ordering. ----------------------- The first word in a line gives the least significant bit of the color register and the second word gives the most significant bit. Sprites get their color information from the color registers much like screens do. See the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual for more information on the assignment of color registers to sprites. Note that the color number given above is added to a base number to determine the actual hardware color register. The colors of the Intuition pointer may be changed. The Intuition pointer is always sprite 0. To change the colors of sprite 0, call the graphics library routine SetRGB4() . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
