2 / About User Interfaces / Goals of Intuition ]" border=0> Intuition was designed with two major goals in mind. The first is to give users a friendly and consistent environment to control the functions of the Amiga operating system and its applications. The second goal (the big one) is to give application designers a graphical user interface toolkit that manages all the complexities of sharing the system with other programs that may be running at the same time. Since the Amiga is a multitasking computer, many programs can reside in memory at the same time sharing the system's resources with one another. Programs take turns running so that, from the user's point of view, it appears that many programs are running simultaneously. On a multitasking computer like the Amiga, the user interface design must allow the user to control many programs with just one monitor, one keyboard, and one mouse. (Imagine driving many cars simultaneously with one steering wheel.) Intuition supplies the tools needed to solve this problem. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
