TITLE: 4 / / Opening A Window / Setting Window Attributes

4 / / Opening A Window / Setting Window Attributes ]" border=0> Depending on which function is used to open a window, the window's attributes may be specified using TagItem s, or a NewWindow structure or an ExtNewWindow structure. In the code above , the window attributes are set up with an array of TagItems: struct TagItem win_tags[] = { {WA_Left, MY_WIN_LEFT}, {WA_Top, MY_WIN_TOP}, {WA_Width, MY_WIN_WIDTH}, {WA_Height, MY_WIN_HEIGHT}, {WA_CloseGadget,TRUE}, {WA_IDCMP, IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW}, {TAG_DONE, NULL}, }; These window attributes set the window's position ( WA_Left, WA_Top ) and size ( WA_Width, WA_Height ), request a close gadget on the window ( WA_CloseGadget ) and ask Intuition to send a message whenever the user activates the close gadget ( WA_IDCMP ). Throughout this chapter window attributes are referred to by their TagItem ID name (the name is always prefixed with "WA_"). See the section below on " Window Attributes " for a complete list. Old and New Flag Names. ----------------------- The names used for IDCMP flags and window flags have been changed under Release 2. IDCMP flag names are now preceded by "IDCMP_". Likewise window flag names are now preceded by "WFLG_". The old names (and their new equivalents) are listed in iobsolete.h >. You may want to refer to this file if you are working with example code written for V34 and older versions of the OS. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
