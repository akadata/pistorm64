TITLE: 33 / / FORM ILBM / Interpreting ILBMs

33 / / FORM ILBM / Interpreting ILBMs ]" border=0> ILBM is a fairly simple IFF FORM . All you really need to deal with to extract the image are the following chunks: BMHD Information about the size, depth, compaction method (see interpreted hex dump above). CAMG Optional Amiga ViewModes chunk. Most HAM and HALFBRITE ILBM s should have this chunk. If no CAMG chunk is present, and image is 6 planes deep, assume HAM and you'll probably be right. Some Amiga ViewModes flags are HIRES=0x8000, LACE=0x4, HAM=0x800, HALFBRITE=0x80. 2.0 ILBM writers should write a full 32-bit mode ID in the CAMG. See the IFF Manual for more information on writing and interpreting 32-bit CAMG values. CMAP RGB values for color registers 0 to N. Previously, 4-bit RGB components each left justified in a byte. These should now be stored as a full 8-bit RGB values by duplicating 4-bit values in the high and low nibble of the byte. BODY The pixel data, stored in an interleaved fashion as follows (each line individually compacted if BMHD Compression = 1): plane 0 scan line 0 plane 1 scan line 0 plane 2 scan line 0 ... plane n scan line 0 plane 0 scan line 1 plane 1 scan line 1 etc. Optional Chunks Also watch for AUTH Author chunks and (c) copyright chunks and preserve any copyright information if you rewrite the ILBM .
