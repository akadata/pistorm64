TITLE: 28 Graphics Sprites, Bobs and Animation / Using Bobs

28 Graphics Sprites, Bobs and Animation / Using Bobs ]" border=0> The following section describes how to define a Bob (blitter object). Like VSprites, a Bob is a software construct designed to make animation easier. The main advantage of a Bob over a VSprite is that it allows more colors and a width greater than 16 pixels to be defined. To create a Bob, you need both a Bob structure and a VSprite structure. The components common to all GELs -- height, collision-handling information, position in the drawing area and pointers to the image definition -- are part of the VSprite structure. The added features -- such as drawing sequence, data about saving and restoring the background, and other features not applicable to VSprites -- are further specified in the Bob structure.
