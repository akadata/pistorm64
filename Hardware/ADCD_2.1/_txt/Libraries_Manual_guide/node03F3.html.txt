30 / / Creating and Using Layers / Allocating and Deallocating Layers ]" border=0> Layers are created using the routines CreateUpfrontLayer() and CreateBehindLayer() . CreateUpfrontLayer() creates a layer that will appear in front of any existing layers. struct Layer *CreateUpfrontLayer( struct Layer_Info *li, struct BitMap *bm, long x0, long y0, long x1, long y1, long flags, struct BitMap *bm2 ); CreateBehindLayer() creates a layer that appears behind existing layers, but in front of backdrop layers. struct Layer *CreateBehindLayer( struct Layer_Info *li, struct BitMap *bm, long x0, long y0, long x1, long y1, long flags, struct BitMap *bm2 ); Both of these routines return a pointer to a Layer data structure (as defined in the include file layers.h >), or NULL if the operation was unsuccessful. A New Layer Also Gets a RastPort. --------------------------------- When a layer is created, the routine automatically creates a RastPort to go along with it. If the layer's RastPort is passed to the drawing routines, drawing will be restricted to the layer. See " The Layer's RastPort " section above. Use the DeleteLayer() call to remove a layer: LONG DeleteLayer( long dummy, struct Layer *layer ); DeleteLayer() removes a layer from the layer list and frees the memory allocated by the layer creation calls listed above.
