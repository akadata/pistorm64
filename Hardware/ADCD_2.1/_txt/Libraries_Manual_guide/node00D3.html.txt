2 / / Gadgets, Menus And Requesters / Requesters ]" border=0> Gadgets and menus do much of the work of getting commands and option choices from the user. Sometimes though, an application needs to get further information from a user in response to a command which has already been initiated. In that case, a requester can be used. A requester is a temporary sub-window , usually containing several gadgets, used to confirm actions, access files, or adjust the special options of a command the user has already given.
