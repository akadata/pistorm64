26 / / Interrupt Handlers / Interrupt Handler Register Usage ]" border=0> Here are the register conventions for interrupt handlers. D0 Contains no valid information. D1 Contains the 4703 INTENAR and INTREQR registers values AND'ed together. This results in an indication of which interrupts are enabled and active. A0 Points to the base address of the Amiga custom chips. This information is useful for performing indexed instruction access to the chip registers. A1 Points to the data area specified by the is_Data field of the Interrupt structure. Because this pointer is always fetched (regardless of whether you use it), it is to your advantage to make some use of it. A5 Is used as a vector to your interrupt code. A6 Points to the Exec library base (SysBase). You may use this register to call Exec functions or set it up as a base register to access your own library or device. Interrupt handlers are established by passing the Exec function SetIntVector() , your initialized Interrupt structure, and the 4703 interrupt bit number of interest. The parameters for this function are as follows: SetIntVector(ULONG intNumber, struct Interrupt *interrupt) The first argument is the bit number for which this interrupt server is to respond (example INTB_VERTB). The possible bits for interrupts are defined in intbits.h >. The second argument is the address of an interrupt server node as described earlier in this chapter. Keep in mind that certain interrupts are established as server chains and should not be accessed as handlers. The following example demonstrates initialization and installation of an assembler interrupt handler. See the " Resources " chapter for more information on allocating resources, and the " Serial Device " chapter in the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices for the more common method of serial communications. rbf.c The assembler interrupt handler code, RBFHandler, reads the complete word of serial input data from the serial hardware and then separates the character and flag bytes into separate buffers. When the buffers are full, the handler signals the main process causing main to print the character buffer contents, remove the handler, and exit. rbfhandler.asm NOTE. ----- The data structure containing the signal to use, task address pointer, and buffers is allocated and initialized in main(), and passed to the handler via the is_Data pointer of the Interrupt structure.
