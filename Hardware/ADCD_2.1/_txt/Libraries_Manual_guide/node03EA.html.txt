30 / / Types of Layers / Backdrop Layer ]" border=0> A layer of any type may be designated a backdrop layer which will always appear behind all other layers. They may not be moved, sized, or depth-arranged. Non-backdrop layers will always remain in front of backdrop layers regardless of how the non-backdrop layer is moved, sized or depth-arranged.
