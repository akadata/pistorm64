Amiga® RKM Libraries: 14 Workbench and Icon Library ]" border=0> Workbench is the graphic user interface to the Amiga file system that uses symbols called icons to represent disks, directories and files. This chapter shows how to use Workbench and its two support libraries workbench.library and icon.library. Workbench is both a system program and a screen. Normally it is the first thing the user sees when the machine is booted providing a friendly operating environment for launching applications and performing other important system activities like navigating through the Amiga's hierarchical filing system. All application programs should be compatible with Workbench. There are only two things you need to know to do this: how to make icons for your application, data files and directories; and how to get arguments if your application is launched from Workbench.
