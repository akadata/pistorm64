TITLE: 20 / Memory Functions / Memory Attributes

20 / Memory Functions / Memory Attributes ]" border=0> When asking the system for memory, an application can ask for memory with certain attributes. The currently supported flags are listed below. Flags marked "V37" are new memory attributes for Release 2. Allocations which specify these new bits may fail on earlier systems. MEMF_ANY This indicates that there is no requirement for either Fast or Chip memory. In this case, while there is Fast memory available, Exec will only allocate Fast memory. Exec will allocate Chip memory if there is not enough Fast memory. MEMF_CHIP This indicates the application wants a block of chip memory, meaning it wants memory addressable by the Amiga custom chips. Chip memory is required for any data that will be accessed by custom chip DMA. This includes screen memory, images that will be blitted, sprite data, copper lists, and audio data, and pre-V37 floppy disk buffers. If this flag is not specified when allocating memory for these types of data, your code will fail on machines with expanded memory. MEMF_FAST This indicates a memory block outside of the range that the special purpose chips can access. "FAST" means that the special-purpose chips do not have access to the memory and thus cannot cause processor bus contention, therefore processor access will likely be faster. Since the flag specifies memory that the custom chips cannot access, this flag is mutually exclusive with the MEMF_CHIP flag. If you specify the MEMF_FAST flag, your allocation will fail on any Amiga that has only CHIP memory. Use MEMF_ANY if you would prefer FAST memory. MEMF_PUBLIC This indicates that the memory should be accessible to other tasks. Although this flag doesn't do anything right now, using this flag will help ensure compatibility with possible future features of the OS (like virtual memory and memory protection). MEMF_CLEAR This indicates that the memory should be initialized with zeros. MEMF_LOCAL (V37) This indicates memory which is located on the motherboard which is not initialized on reset. MEMF_24BITDMA (V37) This indicates that the memory should be allocated within the 24 bit address space, so that the memory can be used in Zorro-II expansion device DMA transactions. This bit is for use by Zorro-II DMA devices only. It is not for general use by applications. MEMF_REVERSE (V37) Indicates that the memory list should be searched backwards for the highest address memory chunk which can be used for the memory allocation. If an application does not specify any attributes when allocating memory, the system tries to satisfy the request with the first memory available on the system memory lists, which is MEMF_FAST if available, followed by MEMF_CHIP. Make Sure You Have Memory. -------------------------- Always check the result of any memory allocation to be sure the type and amount of memory requested is available. Failure to do so will lead to trying to use an non-valid pointer. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
