TITLE: 5 Intuition Gadgets / Gadget Size and Position

5 Intuition Gadgets / Gadget Size and Position ]" border=0> The position and dimensions of the gadget's select box are defined in the Gadget structure. The LeftEdge , TopEdge , Width and Height values can be absolute numbers or values relative to the size of the window. When using absolute numbers, the values are set once, when the gadget is created. When using relative numbers, the size and position of the select box are adjusted dynamically every time the window size changes. The gadget image is positioned relative to the select box so when the select box moves the whole gadget moves. The size of the gadget image, however, is not usually affected by changes in the select box size ( proportional gadgets are the exception). To create a gadget image that changes size when the select box and window change size, you have to handle gadget rendering yourself or use a BOOPSI gadget.
