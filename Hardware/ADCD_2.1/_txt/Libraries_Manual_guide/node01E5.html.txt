TITLE: 10 Intuition Mouse and Keyboard / The Mouse

10 Intuition Mouse and Keyboard / The Mouse ]" border=0> The Amiga mouse is a small, hand-held input device connected to the Amiga by a flexible cable. The user can input horizontal and vertical coordinates with the mouse by sliding it around on a smooth surface. This movement causes the repositioning of a pointer on the display; whenever the mouse is moved the pointer moves, and in the same direction. The mouse also provides two or three input keys, called mouse buttons, that allow the user to input information to the computer. The basic activities the user can perform with the mouse are shown below. Action Explanation ------ ----------- Moving the Mouse Sliding the body of the mouse over a surface, such as a desk top. Pressing a button Pushing down a mouse button (which is released at some later time). Clicking a button Quickly pressing and releasing a mouse button. Double clicking a button Clicking a button twice in a short period of time. Dragging Pressing a button and moving the mouse while the button is held down. The drag operation is completed by releasing the button. Table 10-1: Mouse Activities The action associated with mouse button presses can occur when the button is first pressed, or while the button is held down, or when the button is released. As an example of this, consider the drag gadget of a window. When the select button of the mouse is first pressed an outline representing the window frame is drawn. While the button is held down the outline remains, and it moves with the pointer as the mouse is moved. When the button is released, the outline is erased and the window takes its new position.
