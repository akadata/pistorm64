3 / Screen Data Structures / The Intuition Screen Data Structure ]" border=0> The structures mentioned above are unified along with other information in Intuition's Screen data structure defined in the include file screens.h >. Notice that the Screen structure contains instances of a ViewPort, RastPort and BitMap. struct Screen { struct Screen *NextScreen; struct Window *FirstWindow; WORD LeftEdge, TopEdge, Width, Height; WORD MouseY, MouseX; UWORD Flags; UBYTE *Title, *DefaultTitle; BYTE BarHeight, BarVBorder, BarHBorder, MenuVBorder, MenuHBorder; BYTE WBorTop, WBorLeft, WBorRight, WBorBottom; struct TextAttr *Font; struct ViewPort ViewPort; struct RastPort RastPort; struct BitMap BitMap; struct Layer_Info LayerInfo; struct Gadget *FirstGadget; UBYTE DetailPen, BlockPen; UWORD SaveColor0; struct Layer *BarLayer; UBYTE *ExtData, *UserData; }; In general, applications don't need to access the fields in the Screen structure directly; they use Intuition functions to manipulate the screen instead. Likewise, applications do not set up the Screen themselves; they use one of the OpenScreen() calls. Here is a description of some of the more interesting members of the Screen structure (it is not meant to be a complete description of all the fields). LeftEdge, TopEdge The LeftEdge and TopEdge variables give the position of the screen relative to the upper left corner of the monitor's visible display (as set by the user in the Overscan preferences editor ). If it is positioned down or to the right, the values are positive. If the screen is positioned up or to the left, the values are negative. The values are in screen resolution pixels. In systems prior to V36 , LeftEdge positioning is ignored and negative TopEdge positions are illegal. The screen position may be set when the screen is opened or later by calling the MoveScreen() function. Note that the screen's actual display position may not exactly equal the coordinates given in the LeftEdge and TopEdge fields of the Screen structure. This can cause a window which is opened in the visible part of the screen to be incorrectly positioned by a few pixels in each direction. This complication is due to hardware constraints that limit the fineness of screen positioning. For instance, high resolution screens can only be positioned in low resolution pixel coordinates, yet the values in the LeftEdge and TopEdge use high resolution pixel coordinates. So when the screen is displayed, its position is rounded to a position available for the monitor. MouseX, MouseY Position of the mouse with respect to the upper left corner of the screen. ViewPort, RastPort, BitMap, LayerInfo Actual instances of the graphics library data structures associated with this screen (not pointers to structures). For normal use of custom screens , these structures may be ignored. BarLayer A pointer to the Layer structure for the screen's title bar . WBorTop, WBorLeft, WBorRight, WBorBottom Window border values, see the " Intuition Windows " chapter for information on pre-calculating the size of window borders for windows that open in this screen. Font The default screen font, this can be used to pre-calculate the size of the window borders for windows that open in this screen. UserData Free for application use. Other Screen structure members provide information on the title bar layer, and attributes of menus and windows opened in the screen. Of particular interest are the values that allow precalculation of window border size. These variables will be discussed in the chapter " Intuition Windows ". [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
