1 / General Development Guidelines / Hardware Programming Guidelines ]" border=0> If you find it necessary to program the hardware directly, then it is your responsibility to write code that will work correctly on the various models and configurations of the Amiga. Be sure to properly request and gain control of the hardware resources you are manipulating, and be especially careful in the following areas: * Kickstart 2.0 uses the 8520 Complex Interface Adaptor (CIA) chips differently than 1.3 did. To ensure compatibility, you must always ask for CIA access using the cia.resource AddICRVector() and RemICRVector() functions. Do not make assumptions about what the system might be using the CIA chips for. If you write directly to the CIA chip registers, do not expect system services such as the trackdisk device to function. If you are leaving the system up, do not read or write to the CIA Interrupt Control Registers directly; use the cia.resource AbleICR() , and SetICR() functions. Even if you are taking over the machine, do not assume the initial contents of any of the CIA registers or the state of any enabled interrupts. * All custom chip registers are Read-only or Write-only. Do not read Write-only registers, and do not write to Read-only registers. * Never write data to, or interpret data from the unused bits or addresses in the custom chip space. To be software-compatible with future chip revisions, all undefined bits must be set to zeros on writes, and must be masked out on reads before interpreting the contents of the register. * Never write past the current end of custom chip space. Custom chips may be extended or enhanced to provide additional registers, or to use bits that are currently undefined in existing registers. * Never read, write, or use any currently undefined address ranges or registers. The current and future usage of such areas is reserved and is subject to change. * Never assume that a hardware register will be initialized to any particular value. Different versions of the OS may leave registers set to different values. Check the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual to ensure that you are setting up all the registers that affect your code.
