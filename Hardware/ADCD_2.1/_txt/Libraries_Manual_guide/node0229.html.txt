TITLE: 13 / Preferences in Release 2 / The ENV: Directory and Notification

13 / Preferences in Release 2 / The ENV: Directory and Notification ]" border=0> One advantage of the new Preferences system in Release 2 is file notification. File notification is a form of interprocess communication available in Release 2 that allows an application to be automatically notified if a change is made to a specific file or directory. This makes it easy for the application to react to changes the user makes to Preferences files. File notification is also used by the system itself. The Release 2 Preferences control program, IPrefs, sets up notification on most of the Preferences files in ENV:sys. If the user alters a Preferences item (normally this is done with a Preferences editor), the system will notify IPrefs about the change and IPrefs will attempt to alter the user's environment to reflect the change. For example, if the user opens the ScreenMode Preferences editor and changes the Workbench screen mode to high-resolution, the new settings are saved in Screenmode.prefs in the ENV:sys directory. IPrefs sets up notification on this file at boot time, so the file system will notify IPrefs of the change. IPrefs will read in the Screenmode.prefs file and reset the Workbench screen to high resolution mode. Here's a short example showing how to set up notification on the serial.prefs file in ENV:sys. The program displays a message in a window whenever this file is changed (e.g., when the user selects the "Use" or "Save" gadget in the Serial Preferences editor). prefnotify.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
