E / Release 2 Changes That Can Affect Compatibility / Graphics ]" border=0> * Do not rely on the order of Copper list instructions. The Release 2 MrgCop() function builds different Copper lists to that of 1.3, by including new registers in the list (e.g., MOVE xxxx,DIWHIGH). This changes the positions of the other instructions. We know of one game that 'assumes' the BPLxPTRs would be at a certain offset in the Copper list, and that is now broken on machines running 2.0 with the new Denise chip. * Graphics and layers functions which use the blitter generally return after starting the final blit. If you are mixing graphics rendering calls and processor access of the same memory, you must WaitBlit() before touching (or deallocating) the source or destination memory with the processor. For example, the Text() function is faster in Release 2, causing some programs to trash partial lines of text. * ColorMap structure is bigger. Programs must use GetColorMap() to create one. * Blitter rtns decide ascend/descend on 1st plane only. * Changing the display mode of an existing screen or viewport while open is still not a supported operation. * GfxBase DisplayFlags and row/cols may not match Workbench screen. * Do not hardcode modulo values - use BitMap->BytesPerRow . * If the graphics Autodocs say that you need a TmpRas of a certain size for some functions, then you must make that the minimum size. In some cases, before 2.0, you may have gotten away with using a smaller TmpRas with some functions (for example Flood() ). To be more robust, graphics now checks the TmpRas size and will fail the function call if the TmpRas is too small. * ECS chips under 2.0 generate displays differently. The display window registers now control DMA. * LoadRGB4() used to poke colors into the active copperlist with no protection against deallocation of that copperlist while it was being poked. Under 2.0, semaphore protection of the copperlist was added to LoadRGB4() which makes it totally incorrect and extremely dangerous to call LoadRGB4() during an interrupt. The general symptom of this problem is that a system deadlock can be caused by dragging one screen up and down while another is cycling. Color cycling should be performed from within a task, not an interrupt. In general, the only functions which may be safely called from within an interrupt are the small list of Exec functions documented in the " Exec Interrupts " chapter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
