32 / / RigidDiskBlock and Alternate Filesystems / BadBlockBlock ]" border=0> This is the current specification for the BadBlockBlock. The end of data occurs when bbb_Next is NULL ($FFFFFFFF), and the summed data is exhausted. bbb_ID == 'BADB' bbb_SummedLongs size of this checksummed structure Note that this is not 64 like most of the other structures. This is the number of valid longs in this image, and can be from 6 to rdb_BlockBytes /4. The latter is the best size for all blocks other than the last one. bbb_ChkSum block checksum (longword sum to zero) bbb_HostID SCSI Target ID of host This describes the initiator ID for the creator of these blocks. (see rdb_HostID discussion) bbb_Next block number of the next BadBlockBlock bbb_Reserved set to zeros bbb_BlockPairs[61] pairs of block remapping information The data starts here and continues as long as indicated by bbb_SummedLongs-6: e.g. if bbb_SummedLongs is 128 (512 bytes), 61 pairs are described here.
