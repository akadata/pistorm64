TITLE: 33 IFFParse Library / Parsing

33 IFFParse Library / Parsing ]" border=0> This is both simple and complicated. It's simple in that it's just one call. It's complicated in that you have to seize control of the parser to get your data. The parser operates automatically, scanning the file, verifying syntax and layout rules. If left to its default behavior, it will scan through the entire file until it reaches the end, whereupon it will tell you that it got to the end. The whole scanning procedure is controlled through one call: error = ParseIFF (iff, controlmode); The control modes are IFFPARSE_SCAN, IFFPARSE_STEP and IFFPARSE_RAWSTEP . For now, only the IFFPARSE_SCAN control mode is considered.
