A / Amiga.lib / Intuition ]" border=0> CallHook() and CallHookA() These functions invoke hooks. CallHook() expects a parameter packet ("message") on the stack, while CallHookA() takes a pointer to the message. DoMethod() and DoMethodA() Boopsi support functions that ask a specified Boopsi object to perform a specific message. The message is passed in the function call for DoMethodA() and on the stack for DoMethod(). The message is invoked on the object's true class. DoSuperMethod() and DoSuperMethodA() Boopsi support functions that ask a Boopsi object to perform a supplied message as if it was an instance of its superclass. The message is passed in the function call for DoSuperMethodA() and on the stack for DoSuperMethod(). CoerceMethod() and CoerceMethodA() Boopsi support functions that ask a Boopsi object to perform a supplied message as if it was an instance of some other class. The message is passed in the function call for CoerceMethodA() and on the stack for CoerceMethod. SetSuperAttrs() Boopsi support function which invokes the OM_SET method on the superclass of the supplied class for the supplied object. Allows the ops_AttrList to be supplied on the stack (i.e. in a varargs way). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
