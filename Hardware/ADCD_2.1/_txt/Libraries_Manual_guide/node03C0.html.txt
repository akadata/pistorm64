28 / / Specifying Animation Components / Position of an AnimComp ]" border=0> To specify the placement of each AnimComp relative to its controlling AnimOb , you set the AnimComp members XTrans and YTrans . These values can be positive or negative. The system is designed so that only one of the AnimComp s in any given sequence is "active" (being displayed) at a given point in time. It is the only image in the sequence that is (or is about to be) linked into the GelsInfo list. The Timer determines how long each Component in the sequence remains active, as described below.
