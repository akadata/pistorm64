5 / Boolean Gadget Type / Mutual Exclude ]" border=0> Mutual exclusion of boolean gadgets (sometimes referred to as "radio buttons") is not directly supported by Intuition. This section describes the method an application should use to implement this feature. It is up to the application to handle the manipulation of excluded gadgets in an Intuition compatible way. The program must proceed with caution so as to maintain the synchronization of the gadget and its imagery. The rules provided in this section for the implementation of mutual exclude gadgets minimize the risk and complexity of the application. Other techniques may seem to work with simple input, but may fail in subtle ways when stressed.
