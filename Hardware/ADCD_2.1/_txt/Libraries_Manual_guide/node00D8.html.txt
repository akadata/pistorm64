TITLE: 3 Intuition Screens / Types of Screens

3 Intuition Screens / Types of Screens ]" border=0> Screens are important because they determine the basic resolution and maximum number of colors in the display. Once a screen is set up, these attributes cannot be changed so any graphics work done on a given screen is restricted to that screen's resolution and number of colors. Hence, the type of screen used is a basic design decision. With Intuition screens, a video display can be created in any one of the many Amiga display modes. The basic parameters of the video display such as resolution, total size, frame rate, genlock compatibility, support of screen movement and number of colors are defined by these modes. There are currently four basic modes available on all Amiga models. These basic modes work with conventional monitors (15 kHz scan rate) and older versions of the operating system. Table 3-1: Basic Amiga Display Modes Basic Amiga Resolution Maximum Supports Display Modes NTSC PAL Colors HAM/EHB* ------------- ---------- ------- -------- ------- Lores 320x200 320x256 32 of 4096 Yes Lores- Interlaced 320x400 320x512 32 of 4096 Yes Hires 640x200 640x256 16 of 4096 No Hires-Interlaced 640x400 640x512 16 of 4096 No * HAM and EHB modes provide for additional colors with some restrictions. With Release 2 of the operating system, many other display modes are available (these usually require a special monitor or ECS ). All these display modes, including the specialized modes, are integrated through the graphics library display database.
