5 / / Custom String Editing / Actions with SGH_CLICK ]" border=0> SGA_END or SGA_REUSE may not be set for the SGH_CLICK command . Intuition will not allow gadgets which go inactive when chosen by the user. The gadget always consumes mouse events in its select box. With SGH_CLICK, always leave the SGA_REDISPLAY flag set, since Intuition uses this when activating a string gadget. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
