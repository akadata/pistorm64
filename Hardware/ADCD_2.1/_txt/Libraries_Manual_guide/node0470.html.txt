34 / / Details Of the Keymap Structure / LoKeyMap and HighKeyMap ]" border=0> The low key map provides translation of the key values from hex 00-3F; the high key map provides translation of key values from hex 40-7F. Key values from hex 68-7F are not used by the existing keyboards, but this may change in the future. A raw key value (hex 00-7F) plus hex 80 is the release of that key. If you need to check for raw key releases do it like this: if (keyvalue & 0x80) { /* do key up processing */ } else { /* do key down processing */ } Raw output from the keyboard for the low key map does not include the space bar, Tab, Alt, Ctrl, arrow keys, and several other keys.

These entries are interpreted in one of three possible ways: * As four separate bytes, specifying how the key is to be interpreted when pressed alone, with one qualifier, with another qualifier, or with both qualifiers (where a qualifier is one of three possible keys: Ctrl, Alt, or Shift). * As a longword containing the address of a string descriptor, where a string of characters is to be output when this key is pressed. If a string is to be output, any combination of qualifiers can affect the string that may be transmitted. * As a longword containing the address of a dead-key descriptor, where additional data describe the character to be output when this key is pressed alone or with another dead key. The keymap tables must be word aligned. --------------------------------------- The keymap tables must begin aligned on a word boundary. Each entry is four bytes long, thereby maintaining word alignment throughout the table. This is necessary because some of the entries may be longword addresses and must be aligned properly for the 68000. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
