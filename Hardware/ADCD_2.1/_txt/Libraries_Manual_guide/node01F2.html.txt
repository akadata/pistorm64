TITLE: 10 / The Keyboard / Menu Shortcuts

10 / The Keyboard / Menu Shortcuts ]" border=0> Menu items and sub-items may be paired with command key sequences to associate certain characters with specific menu item selections. This gives the user a shortcut method to select frequently used menu operations, such as Undo, Cut, and Paste. Whenever the user presses the right Amiga key with an alphanumeric key, the menu strip of the active window is scanned to see if there are any command key sequences in the list that match the sequence entered by the user. If there is a match, Intuition translates the key combination into the appropriate menu item number and transmits the menu number to the application program. Menu Shortcuts Look Like the Real Thing. ---------------------------------------- To the application it looks as if the user had selected a given menu item with the mouse. The program will receive a menu event, not a key event. For more information on menu item selection, see the " Intuition Menus " chapter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
