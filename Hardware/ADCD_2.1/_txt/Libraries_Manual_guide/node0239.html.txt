TITLE: 14 Workbench and Icon Library / Workbench Environment

14 Workbench and Icon Library / Workbench Environment ]" border=0> On the Amiga there are at least two ways to start a program running: * By activating a tool or project icon in Workbench (an icon is activated by pointing to it with the mouse and double-clicking the mouse select button.) * By typing the name of an executable file at the Shell (also known as the CLI or Command Line Interface) In the Workbench environment, a program is run as a separate process. A process is simply a task with additional information needed to use DOS library. By default, a Workbench program does not have a window to which its output will go. Therefore, stdin and stdout do not point to legal file handles. This means you cannot use stdio functions such as printf() if your program is started from Workbench unless you first set up a stdio window. Some compilers have options or defaults to provide a stdio window for programs started from Workbench. In Release 2, applications can use an auto console window for stdio when started from Workbench by opening "CON:0/0/640/200/auto/close/wait" as a file. An auto console window will only open if stdio input or output occurs. This can also be handled in the startup code module that comes with your compiler.
