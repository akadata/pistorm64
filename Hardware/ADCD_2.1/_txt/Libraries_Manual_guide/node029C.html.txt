TITLE: 19 / Accessing a Device / Creating a Message Port

19 / Accessing a Device / Creating a Message Port ]" border=0> When a device completes the command in a message, it will return the message to the message port specifed as the reply port in the message. A message port is obtained by calling the CreateMsgPort() or CreatePort() function. You must delete the message port when you are finished by calling the DeleteMsgPort() or DeletePort() function. If your application needs to be compatible with pre-V36 versions of the operating system, use the amiga.lib functions CreatePort() and DeletePort() ; if you require V36 or higher, you may use the Exec ROM functions CreateMsgPort() and DeleteMsgPort() .
