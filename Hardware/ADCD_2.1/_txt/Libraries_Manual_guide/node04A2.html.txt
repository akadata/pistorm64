37 Utility Library / Callback Hooks ]" border=0> The callback features of Release 2 provide a standard means for applications to extend the functionality of libraries, devices, and applications. This standard makes it easy for the operating system to use custom modules from different high level programming languages as part of the operating system. For example, the layers library, which takes care of treating a display as a series of layered regions, allows an application to attach a pattern function to a display layer. Instead of filling in the background of a layer with the background color, the layers library calls the custom pattern function which fills in the layer display with a custom background pattern.
