TITLE: 4 Intuition Windows / Window Attributes

4 Intuition Windows / Window Attributes ]" border=0> This section discusses all window attributes. As mentioned earlier, a window's attributes may be specified with either TagItems , NewWindow or ExtNewWindow depending on how the window is opened. Attributes are listed here by their TagItem ID name (TagItem.ti_Tag). For each tag item, the equivalent field setting in the NewWindow structure is also listed if it exists. Some window attributes specified with tags are available only in Release 2 and have no NewWindow equivalent.
