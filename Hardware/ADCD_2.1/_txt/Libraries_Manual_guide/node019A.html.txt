TITLE: 6 / Menu Data Structures / MenuItem Structure

6 / Menu Data Structures / MenuItem Structure ]" border=0> The MenuItem structure is used for both items and sub-items. There is no internal difference between items and sub-items, other than how they are linked into the menu strip. Items are linked directly to Menu structures through the FirstItem field, sub-items are linked to MenuItem structures through the SubItem field. Here is the specification: struct MenuItem { struct MenuItem *NextItem; WORD LeftEdge, TopEdge; WORD Width, Height; UWORD Flags; LONG MutualExclude; APTR ItemFill; APTR SelectFill; BYTE Command; struct MenuItem *SubItem; UWORD NextSelect; }; The fields have the following meanings: NextItem This field is a pointer to the next item in the list. The last item in the list should have a NextItem value of NULL. LeftEdge, TopEdge, Width, Height These fields describe the select box of the MenuItem. The LeftEdge is relative to the LeftEdge of the Menu . The TopEdge is relative to the topmost position Intuition allows. TopEdge is based on the way the user has the system configured--which font, which resolution, and so on. Use 0 for the topmost position. Flags The flag space is shared by the program and Intuition. See " MenuItem Flags " below for a description of the flag bits. MutualExclude Use these bits to describe which of the other items, if any, are mutually excluded by this one. This long word refers to the items in the same menu as this one. A maximum of 32 items may be described by this variable, and they must be the first 32 items in the menu. This does not mean that there cannot be more than 32 items in any given menu, just that only the first 32 can be mutually excluded. ItemFill This points to the data used in rendering this MenuItem. It can point to either an instance of an IntuiText structure with text for this MenuItem or an instance of an Image structure with image data. The program tells Intuition the type of data pointed to by this variable by setting or clearing the MenuItem flag bit ITEMTEXT . (See " MenuItem Flags " below for more details about ITEMTEXT.) Note that the IntuiText or Image data need not be simple imagery, either of them may consist of multiple objects of the same type chained together, described in " Intuition Images,Line Drawing and Text " chapter. By chaining multiple IntuiText structures, the application may "fine tune" the positioning of text within each item. This is especially important for proportional fonts, where the width of the individual characters is not constant. This also allows items to have part of the text left justified and part right justified. SelectFill If HIGHIMAGE is set in the Flags variable as the MenuItem highlighting mode, Intuition substitutes this alternate image or text for the original rendering described by ItemFill. The type of this structure must be the same as ItemFill. SelectFill can point to either an Image or an IntuiText , where the type is determined by the setting of the ITEMTEXT flag. Command This variable is storage for a single alphanumeric character to be used as the command key substitute for this menu item. The command key sequence will be rendered in the menu display to the right of the item's select area, with a fancy, reverse-video A, followed by the command character. Case is ignored. If the flag COMMSEQ is set, the user can hold down the right Amiga key on the keyboard (to mimic using the right mouse menu button) and press the indicated key as a shortcut for using the mouse to select this item. SubItem If this item has a sub-item list, this variable should point to the MenuItem structure describing the first sub-item in the list. There Is No Such Thing as a Sub-sub-item. ----------------------------------------- A sub-item cannot have a sub-item attached to it. If this MenuItem structure is not an item, this variable is ignored. NextSelect This field is filled in by Intuition when this MenuItem is selected by the user. After an item has been selected by the user, the program should process the request and then check the NextSelect field. If the NextSelect field is equal to MENUNULL , no other items were selected; otherwise, there is another item to process. See " Menu Numbers " and " Menu Selection Messages " above for more information about user selections. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
