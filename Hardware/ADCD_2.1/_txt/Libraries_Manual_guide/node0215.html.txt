12 / / Writing The Dispatcher / Making the New Class ]" border=0> The Intuition function MakeClass() creates a new Boopsi class: Class *MakeClass(UBYTE *newclassID, UBYTE *pubsuperclassID, Class *privsuperclass, UWORD instancesize, ULONG flags); If the new class is going to be public, newclassID is a string naming the new class. If the new class is private, this field is NULL. The next two fields tell MakeClass() where to find the new class's superclass. If the superclass is public, pubsuperclassID points to a string naming that public superclass and the privsuperclass pointer is NULL. If the superclass is private, privsuperclass points to that superclass's Class structure and pubsuperclassID is NULL. The size of the new class's local instance data is instancesize. The last parameter, flags, is for future enhancement. For now, make this zero. If it is successful, MakeClass() returns a pointer to the new class, otherwise it returns NULL. When MakeClass() is successful, it also takes measures to make sure no one can "close" the new class's superclass (using FreeClass() ). It does this by incrementing a private field of the superclass that keeps track of how many subclasses the superclass currently has. After successfully creating a class, an application has to tell the class where its dispatcher is. The Class pointer (defined in classes.h >) returned by MakeClass() contains a Hook structure called cl_Dispatcher, which is used to call the dispatcher. The application has to initialize this hook: myclass->cl_Dispatcher.h_Entry = HookEntry; /* HookEntry() is defined in amiga.lib */ myclass->cl_Dispatcher.h_SubEntry = dispatchRKMModel; The h_Entry field points to a function in amiga.lib that copies the function arguments to where the dispatcher expects them. See the " Callback Hooks " section of the "Utility Library" chapter of this manual for more details. To make a class public instead of private, an application has to call AddClass() in addition to giving the class a name in MakeClass() . AddClass() takes one argument, a pointer to a valid Class structure that has been initialized as a public class by MakeClass(). To remove a public class added to the system with AddClass(), pass the public class pointer to RemoveClass(). See the Intuition Autodocs for more details on AddClass() and RemoveClass() .
