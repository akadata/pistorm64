TITLE: 29 Graphics Library and Text / The Text Function

29 Graphics Library and Text / The Text Function ]" border=0> Amiga text rendering is centered around the graphics.library function Text() , which renders text into a rastport: void Text( struct RastPort *myrp, STRPTR mystring, ULONG count ); where myrp is a pointer to the target rastport, mystring is the string to render, and count is the number of characters of mystring to render. Text() renders at the current rastport position and it takes care of moving the rastport's current X position as it renders each letter. Text() only renders text horizontally, so repositioning the rastport's Y position (for example, for a new line) is the responsibility of the application. This is covered in more detail later in this chapter. Like the other rastport based graphics primitives, most of the text rendering attributes are specified within the RastPort structure itself. The current position, the color of the text, and even the font itself are all specified in the RastPort structure.
