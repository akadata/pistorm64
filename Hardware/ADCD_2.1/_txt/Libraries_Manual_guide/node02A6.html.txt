TITLE: Amiga® RKM Libraries: 20 Exec Memory Allocation

Amiga® RKM Libraries: 20 Exec Memory Allocation ]" border=0> Exec manages all of the free memory currently available in the system. Using linked list structures, Exec keeps track of memory and provides the functions to allocate and access it. When an application needs some memory, it can either declare the memory statically within the program or it can ask Exec for some memory. When Exec receives a request for memory, it looks through its list of free memory regions to find a suitably sized block that matches the size and attributes requested.
