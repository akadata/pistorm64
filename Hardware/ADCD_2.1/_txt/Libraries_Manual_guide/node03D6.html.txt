TITLE: 29 / The Text Function / Choosing the Font

29 / The Text Function / Choosing the Font ]" border=0> The graphics.library function SetFont() changes the rastport's current font: void SetFont( struct RastPort *myrp, struct TextFont *mytf ); The parameter mytf is a pointer to an open, valid TextFont structure. The system uses the TextFont structure to keep track of fonts (The TextFont structure is discussed in detail later in this chapter). The OpenFont() (from graphics.library) and OpenDiskFont() (from diskfont.library) functions both return a pointer to a valid TextFont structure. The OpenFont() function will only open fonts that have already been loaded and are currently in the system list. Normally applications use the OpenDiskFont() call instead of OpenFont() because OpenDiskFont() can load and open fonts from disk as well as open those that are already in the system list. Here are prototypes for these functions: struct TextFont *OpenDiskFont( struct TextAttr *mytextAttr ); struct TextFont *OpenFont( struct TextAttr *mytextAttr ); The mytextAttr argument points to a TextAttr structure that describes the requested font. The TextAttr structure (from text.h >) looks like this: struct TextAttr { STRPTR ta_Name; /* name of the font */ UWORD ta_YSize; /* height of the font */ UBYTE ta_Style; /* intrinsic font style */ UBYTE ta_Flags; /* font preferences and flags */ }; where ta_Name is a string naming the font to open, ta_YSize is the point size of the font (normally in pixels), ta_Style is a bitfield describing the font style, and ta_Flags is a bitfield that further describes characteristics of the font. Note that the name of the font can either be the font name alone ( .font) or it can be prepended with a full path. Without a path to the font, if the font is not already loaded into the system list, OpenDiskFont() will look in the FONTS: directory for the font file. If there is a path, OpenDiskFont() will look in that directory for the font files, allowing the user to put fonts in any directory (although this is discouraged). OpenFont() and OpenDiskFont() try to find a font that matches your TextAttr description. An important thing to remember about OpenDiskFont() is that only a process can call it (as opposed to a task). This is primarily because the function has to use dos.library to scan disks for font files. The font styles for ta_Style (from text.h >) are: FSF_UNDERLINED The font is underlined FSF_BOLD The font is bolded FSF_ITALIC The font is italicized FSF_EXTENDED The font is extra wide The flags for ta_Flags (from text.h >) are: FPF_ROMFONT This font is built into the ROM (currently, only Topaz-8 and Topaz-9 are ROM fonts). FPF_DISKFONT This font was loaded from disk (with diskfont.library) FPF_REVPATH This font is designed to be printed from from right to left (Hebrew is written from right to left) FPF_TALLDOT This font was designed for a Hires screen (640x200 NTSC, non-interlaced) FPF_WIDEDOT This font was designed for a Lores Interlaced screen (320x400 NTSC) FPF_PROPORTIONAL The character widths of this font are not constant FPF_DESIGNED This font size was explicitly designed at this size rather than constructed. If you do not set this bit in your TextAttr, then the system may generate a font for you by scaling an existing ROM or disk font (under V36 and above). For example to open an 11 point bold, italic Topaz font, the code would look something like this: pseudotext.c The example above uses the graphics.library's SetFont() function to change the rastport's current font. Notice that this example restores the rastport's original font (myrp->Font) before exiting. This isn't normally necessary unless some other process assumes the rastport's font (or other drawing attributes) will not change. Intuition does not rely on the window's RPort.Font field for rendering or closing the default window font, so applications can change that font without having to restore it. Prior to Release 2, some applications assumed that any window they opened would always use Topaz-8 without bothering to explicitly set it. Since Topaz-8 was the normal default font before Release 2, this was usually not a problem. However, under Release 2 and later versions of the OS, the user can easily change the default system fonts with the Font Preferences editor. Hence, applications that make assumptions about the size of the default font look terrible under Release 2 (and in some cases are unusable). Program designers should not make assumptions about the system font, and wherever possible, honor the user font preferences. See the " Preferences " chapter of this manual for more information on how to find user preferences. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
