30 / / Types of Layers / Simple Refresh Layer ]" border=0> When an application draws into the layer, any portion of the layer that is visible (not obscured) will be rendered into the common BitMap of the viewing area. All graphics rendering routines are "clipped", so that only exposed sections of the layer are drawn into. No back-up of obscured areas is provided. If another layer operation is performed that causes an obscured part of a simple refresh layer to be exposed, the application must determine if the section need be refreshed, re-drawing the newly exposed part of the layer as required. The basic advantage of simple refresh is that it does not require back-up area to save drawing sections that cannot be seen, saving memory. However, the application needs to monitor the layer to see if it needs refreshing. This is typically performed with statements like: if (layer->Flags & LAYERREFRESH) refresh(layer); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
