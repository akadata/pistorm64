15 / / Other GadTools Functions / DrawBevelBox() ]" border=0> A key visual signature shared by most GadTools gadgets is the raised or recessed bevelled box imagery. Since the program may wish to create its own boxes to match, GadTools provides the DrawBevelBox() and DrawBevelBoxA() functions. void DrawBevelBoxA( struct RastPort *rport, long left, long top, long width, long height, struct TagItem *taglist ); void DrawBevelBox ( struct RastPort *rport, long left, long top, long width, long height, Tag tag1, ... ); The rport argument is a pointer to the RastPort into which the box is to be rendered. The left, top, width and height arguments specify the dimensions of the desired box. The tag arguments, tag1 or taglist, may be set as follows: GT_VisualInfo (APTR) The VisualInfo handle as returned by a prior call to GetVisualInfo() . This value is required. GTBB_Recessed (BOOL) A bevelled box may either appear to be raised to signify an area of the window that is selectable or recessed to signify an area of the window in which clicking will have no effect. Set this boolean tag to TRUE to get a recessed box. Omit this tag entirely to get a raised box. DrawBevelBox() is a rendering operation, not a gadget. This means that the program must refresh any bevelled boxes rendered through this function if the window gets damaged. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
