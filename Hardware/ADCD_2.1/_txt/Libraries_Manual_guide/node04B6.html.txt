TITLE: A / Amiga.lib / Commodities

A / Amiga.lib / Commodities ]" border=0> ArgArrayInit() and ArgArrayDone() ArgArrayInit() returns an array of strings suitable for sending to icon.library/ FindToolType() . This array will be the ToolTypes array of the program's icon, if it was started from Workbench. It will just be 'argv' if the program was started from a shell. ArgArrayDone() frees memory and does cleanup required after a call to ArgArrayInit(). ArgInt() and ArgString() These functions look for a particular entry in a ToolType array returned by ArgArrayInit() and return the integer (ArgInt()) or string (ArgString()) associated with that entry. A default value can be passed to each function which will be returned in the event that the requested entry could not be found in the ToolType array. CxCustom() This function creates a custom commodity object. The action of this object on receiving a commodity message is to call a function of the application programmer's choice. CxDebug() This function creates a Commodities debug object. The action of this object on receiving a Commodities message is to print out information about the message through the serial port (using the debug.lib/ KprintF() routine). A specified 'id' will also be displayed. CxFilter() Creates a Commodities input event filter object that matches a description string. The description string is in the same format as strings expected by commodities.library/ SetFilter() . If the description string is NULL, the filter will not match any messages. CxSender() This function creates a Commodities sender object. The action of this object on receiving a Commodities message is to copy the Commodities message into a standard Exec Message, to put a supplied id in the message as well, and to send the message off to the message port. CxSignal() This function creates a Commodities signal object. The action of this object on receiving a Commodities message is to send a signal to a task. The caller is responsible for allocating the signal and determining the proper task ID. CxTranslate() This function creates a Commodities translator object. The action of this object on receiving a Commodities message is to replace that message in the commodities network with a chain of Commodities input messages. HotKey() This function creates a triad of commodity objects to accomplish a high-level function. The three objects are a filter, which is created to match by CxFilter(), a sender created by CxSender(), and a translator which is created by CxTranslate(), so that it swallows any commodity input event messages that are passed down by the filter. This is the simple way to get a message sent to your program when the user performs a particular input action. InvertString() This function returns a linked list of input events which would translate into the string using the supplied keymap (or the system default keymap if the supplied keymap is NULL). This chain should eventually be freed using FreeIEvents(). FreeIEvents() This function frees a linked list of input events as obtained from InvertString(). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
