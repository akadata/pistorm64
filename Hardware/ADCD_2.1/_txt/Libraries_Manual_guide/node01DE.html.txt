9 / / Event Message Classes and Flags / Menu Flags ]" border=0> IDCMP_MENUPICK This flag indicates that the user has pressed the menu button. If a menu item was selected, the menu number of the menu item can be found in the Code field of the IntuiMessage . If no item was selected, the Code field will be equal to MENUNULL. IDCMP_MENUVERIFY This is a special verification mode which allows the program to confirm that it is prepared to handle Intuition rendering, in this case, allowing menus to be drawn in the screen. This is a special kind of verification, in that any window in the entire screen that has this flag set must respond before the menu operations may proceed. Also, the active window of the screen is allowed to cancel the menu operation. This is unique to IDCMP_MENUVERIFY. Refer to the "Intuition Menus" for a complete description. Also see the " Verification Functions " section below for more information. IDCMP_MENUHELP This message is sent by Intuition when the user selects the Help key while the menu system is activated. If a menu item was selected, the menu number of the menu item can be found in the Code field of the IntuiMessage . If no item was selected, the Code field will be equal to MENUNULL. These messages will only be sent if the WA_MenuHelp attribute is set for the window. The menu number returned in IDCMP_MENUHELP may specify a position that cannot be generated through normal menu activity. For instance, the menu number may indicate one of the menu headers with no item or sub-item. See the chapter on "Intuition Menus " for more information. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
