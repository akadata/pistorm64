28 / / Animation Types / Simple Motion Control ]" border=0> To produce motion of a simple object, such as a ball, the object is simply moved relative to a background display, a little at a time. This is simple motion control, and can be accomplished with one AnimComp and one AnimOb , by simply changing the AnimOb's position every N video frames. The apparent speed of the object is a combination of how often it is moved (every frame, every other frame, etc.) and how far it is moved (how much the AnimOb's AnX and AnY are changed).
