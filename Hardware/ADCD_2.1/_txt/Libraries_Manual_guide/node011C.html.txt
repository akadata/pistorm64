TITLE: 4 / / Refreshing Intuition Windows / SuperBitMap Refresh

4 / / Refreshing Intuition Windows / SuperBitMap Refresh ]" border=0> The SuperBitMap refresh type allows the application to provide and maintain bitmap memory for graphics in the window. The bitmap can be any size as long as the window sizing limits respect the maximum size of the bitmap. SuperBitMap windows have their own memory for maintaining all obscured parts of the window up to the size of the defined bitmap, including those parts outside of the current window. Intuition will update all parts of the window that are revealed through changes in sizing and changes in window overlapping. The application never needs to redraw portions of the window that were revealed by sizing or positioning windows in the screen. SuperBitMap windows require the application to allocate a bitmap for use as off-screen memory, instead of using Intuition managed buffers. This bitmap must be as large as, or larger than, the inner window's maximum dimensions (that is, the window's outside dimensions less the border sizes). SuperBitMap windows are almost always WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO , which renders the borders and system gadgets in a separate bitmap. If the application wishes to create a SuperBitMap window that is not GimmeZeroZero , it must make the window borderless with no system gadgets, so that no border imagery is rendered by Intuition into the application's bitmap.
