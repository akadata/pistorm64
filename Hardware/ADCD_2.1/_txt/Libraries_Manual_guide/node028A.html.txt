TITLE: 17 / Signals / Looking for Break Keys

17 / Signals / Looking for Break Keys ]" border=0> One common usage of signals on the Amiga is for processing a user break. As was mentioned earlier, the OS reserves 16 of a tasks 32 signals for system use. Four of those 16 signals are used to tell a task about the Control-C, D, E, and F break keys. An application can process these signals. Usually, only CLI-based programs receive these signals because the Amiga's console handler is about the only user input source that sets these signals when it sees the Control-C, D, E, and F key presses. The signal masks for each of these key presses are defined in dos.h >: SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C SIGBREAKF_CTRL_D SIGBREAKF_CTRL_E SIGBREAKF_CTRL_F Note that these are bit masks and not bit numbers.
