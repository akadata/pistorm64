TITLE: B / itexticlass / New Methods: IM_DRAW/IM_DRAWFRAME

B / itexticlass / New Methods: IM_DRAW/IM_DRAWFRAME ]" border=0> These methods ask an itexticlass object to render its IntuiText structure, which it gets from the imageclass IA_Data attribute. An itexticlass object renders its IntuiText relative to the IA_Left and IA_Top attributes it inherits from imageclass. This method uses the JAM1 drawing mode and the IA_FGPen to render the text. See the imageclass description of IM_DRAW / IM_DRAWFRAME for more details. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
