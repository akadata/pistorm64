TITLE: D / Errors / Crashes--Only on 68000 and 68010

D / Errors / Crashes--Only on 68000 and 68010 ]" border=0> This can be caused by illegal instructions (80000000.00000004) such as new 68020/30/40 instructions or inline 68881/882 code. But this is usually caused by a word or longword access at an odd address. This is legal on the 68020 and above, but will generate an Address Error (80000000.00000003) on a 68000 or 68010. This can be caused by using uninitialized pointers, using freed memory, or using system structures improperly (for example, referencing into IntuiMessage->IAddress as a struct Gadget * on a non-Gadget message).
