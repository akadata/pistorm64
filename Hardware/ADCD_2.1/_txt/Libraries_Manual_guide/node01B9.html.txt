8 Intuition Images, Line Drawing and Text / Creating Images ]" border=0> With an Image structure an application can create graphic objects quickly and easily and display them almost anywhere. Images have an additional attribute that makes them even more economical--by changing two simple data elements in the Image structure, the color of the image may be changed. Images are rectangular bitmaps which individually define the color of each pixel represented. Images may not be masked to allow part of the background to show through. The entire rectangular image is drawn into the target element, overwriting any data it may overlap. All bitplanes defined in the target RastPort within the image's rectangle are overwritten either with image data, ones or zeros. Image s may be directly drawn by the application by using the DrawImage() function, described below. The image may be rendered into any screen or window RastPort with this function. ( DrawImageState() can also be used to draw the image. The visual imagery for an Image can be removed from the display by calling EraseImage() . For a normal Image structure, this will call the graphics function EraseRect() , which clears the Image rectangle by using the layer's backfill pen to overwrite it. Alternately, images can be used indirectly by attaching them to menus, gadgets or requesters when they are initialized. For instance, in menus the MenuItem structure has the ItemFill and SelectFill fields. If the ITEMTEXT flag is cleared and the HIGHIMAGE flag is set, the application may place a pointer to a list of Image structures in each of these fields. The system will display the ItemFill images when the menu item is not selected and the SelectFill images when the menu item is selected. The application does not have to take any specific action to display these images. Once the menus have been added to a window, their management and display is under Intuition control. The number of bitplanes in an image does not have to match the number of bitplanes in the display element in which the image is rendered. This provides great flexibility in using Image structures, as the same image may be reused in many places. If the application's window is on the Workbench or some other public screen, it must use caution with hard-coded or constant image data, as the color palette of that screen is subject to change. If the application has its own custom screen, and it is appropriate for the colors of that screen to change, the same situation arises. Starting with V36, Intuition allows the screen opener to provide a mapping of pen number and rendering functions. For example, pens are specified for the bright and dark edges of three dimensional objects. Applications can obtain this mapping from the DrawInfo structure. See the " Intuition Screens " chapter for more information on DrawInfo and the new 3D look of Intuition in Release 2. A suitably designed image may be drawn into a screen or window of any depth. To accomplish this, the application must ensure that detail is not lost when the image is displayed in a single bitplane RastPort , where only the first bitplane of image data will be displayed. This is important if the image will ever be displayed on the Workbench screen or any other public screen.
