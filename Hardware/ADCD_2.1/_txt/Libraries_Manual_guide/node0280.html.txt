16 / Creating a File Requester / The Directory Requester ]" border=0> Sometimes a program may only require a directory name from the user. There is another variation on asl.library's file requester that allows this. The ASL_ExtFlags1 tag contains a flag bit to toggle this option. If the FIL1F_NOFILES flag of ASL_ExtFlags1 is set, the requester will appear without a string gadget for file names and will display only directory names in the scrolling list gadget. When AslRequest() (or AslRequestTags() ) returns successfully, the rf_Dir field of the FileRequester structure contains the name of the directory the user selected. Another flag defined for ASL_ExtFlags1 is FIL1F_MATCHDIRS. If file pattern matching is on (see the FILF_PATGAD flag for ASL_FuncFlags, setting FIL1F_MATCHDIRS tells the file requester to pattern match directory names as well as file names. Of course, if both of these ASL_ExtFlags1 flags are set, the requester will only pattern match directory names. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
