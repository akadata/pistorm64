TITLE: 29 Graphics Library and Text / Composition of a Bitmap Font on Disk

29 Graphics Library and Text / Composition of a Bitmap Font on Disk ]" border=0> For each Amiga bitmap font stored on disk (normally in the FONTS: assign directory), there is a corresponding ".font" file, a directory, and within that directory, a series of files bearing numeric names. For example, for the font Sapphire, within FONTS:, there is a file called sapphire.font, a directory called Sapphire, and within the directory Sapphire are the files 14 and 19. For a bitmap font (including color fonts), the ".font" file is a FontContentsHeader structure: struct FontContentsHeader { UWORD fch_FileID; /* FCH_ID */ UWORD fch_NumEntries; /* the number of FontContents elements */ struct FontContents fch_FC[]; /* or struct TFontContents fch_TFC[]; */ }; #define MAXFONTPATH 256 Where the fch_FileID field can be be either: FCH_ID 0x0f00 This FontContentsHeader uses FontContents structures to describe the available sizes of this font. TFCH_ID 0x0f02 This FontContentsHeader uses TFontContents structures to describe the available sizes of this font. The fch_FileID can also be equal to 0x0f03, but that is only for scalable outline fonts. The FontContents structure: struct FontContents { char fc_FileName[MAXFONTPATH]; UWORD fc_YSize; UBYTE fc_Style; UBYTE fc_Flags; }; describes one of the sizes of this font that is available to the system as a designed font size. For each FontContents structure, there should be a corresponding font descriptor file in this font's directory that contains data for this size font. The FontContents fields correspond to the similarly named field in the TextFont structure. The TFontContents structure is almost the same as the FontContents structure except that it allows the OS to store tag value pairs in the extra space not used by the file name. Currently, this allows the OS to preserve the X and Y DPI ( TA_DeviceDPI ) values for a font. struct TFontContents { char tfc_FileName[MAXFONTPATH-2]; UWORD tfc_TagCount; /* including the TAG_DONE tag */ /* * if tfc_TagCount is non-zero, tfc_FileName is overlaid with * Text Tags starting at: (struct TagItem *) * &tfc_FileName[MAXFONTPATH-(tfc_TagCount*sizeof * (struct TagItem))] */ UWORD tfc_YSize; UBYTE tfc_Style; UBYTE tfc_Flags; }; The fch_NumEntries contains the number of font sizes (and the number of FontContents or TFontContents structures) that this ".font" file describes. The fch_FC[] is the array of FontContents or TFontContents structures that describe this font. For each font size described in a FontContents (or TFontContents) structure, there is a corresponding file in that font's directory whose name is its size. For example, for the font size Sapphire-19, there is a file in the Sapphire directory called 19. That file is basically a DiskFontHeader disguised as a loadable DOS hunk and is known as a font descriptor file. This allows the diskfont.library to use the dos.library to load the module just like it was a hunk of relocatable 680x0 instructions. It even contains two instructions before the real DiskFontHeader structure that will cause the 680x0 to stop running the DiskFontHeader if it does inadvertently get executed. #define MAXFONTNAME 32 /* font name including ".font" */ struct DiskFontHeader { /* the following 8 bytes are not actually considered a part of */ /* the DiskFontHeader, but immediately precede it. The */ /* NextSegment is supplied by the linker/loader, and the */ /* ReturnCode is the code at the beginning of the font in case */ /* someone runs it... */ /* ULONG dfh_NextSegment; actually a BPTR */ /* ULONG dfh_ReturnCode; MOVEQ #0,D0 : RTS */ /* here then is the official start of the DiskFontHeader... */ struct Node dfh_DF; /* node to link disk fonts */ UWORD dfh_FileID; /* DFH_ID */ UWORD dfh_Revision; /* the font revision */ LONG dfh_Segment; /* the segment address when loaded */ char dfh_Name[MAXFONTNAME]; /* the font name (null terminated) */ struct TextFont dfh_TF; /* loaded TextFont structure */ }; /* unfortunately, this needs to be explicitly typed */ /* used only if dfh_TF.tf_Style FSB_TAGGED bit is set */ #define dfh_TagList dfh_Segment /* destroyed during loading */ The dfh_DF field is an Exec Node structure that the diskfont library uses to link together the fonts it has loaded. The dfh_FileID field contains the file type, which currently is DFH_ID (defined in diskfont.h >). The dfh_Revision field contains a revision number for this font. The dfh_Segment field will contain the segment address when the font is loaded. The dfh_FontName field will contain the font's name after the font descriptor is LoadSeg() 'ed. The last field, dfh_TextFont is a TextFont structure (or ColorTextFont structure) as described in the previous section. The following is a complete example of a proportional, bitmap font. suites8.asm [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
