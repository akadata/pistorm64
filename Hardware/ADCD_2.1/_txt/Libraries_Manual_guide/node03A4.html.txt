28 / / Bob Priorities / Specifying the Drawing Order ]" border=0> To specify the priorities of the Bobs, use the Before and After pointers. Before points to the Bob that this Bob should be drawn before, and After points to the Bob that this Bob should be drawn after. By following these pointers, from Bob to Bob, the system can determine the order in which the Bobs should be drawn. (Take care to avoid circular dependencies in this list!) Note: ----- This terminology is often confusing, but, due to historical reasons, cannot be changed. The system does not draw the Bobs on the Before list first, it draws the Bobs on the After list first. Next, it draws the current Bob, and, finally, the Bobs on the Before list. For example, to assure that myBob1 always appears in front of myBob2, The Before and After pointers must be initialized so that the system will always draw myBob1 after myBob2. myBob2.Before = &myBob1; /* draw Bob2 before drawing Bob1 */ myBob2.After = NULL; /* draw Bob2 after no other Bob */ myBob1.After = &myBob2; /* draw Bob1 after drawing Bob2 */ myBob1.Before = NULL; /* draw Bob1 before no other Bob */ As the system goes through the GelsInfo list, it checks the Bob's After pointer. If this is not NULL, it follows the After pointer until it hits a NULL. Then it starts rendering the Bobs, going back up the Before pointers until it hits a NULL. Then it continues through the GelsInfo list. So, it is important that all Before and After pointers of a group properly point to each other. Note: ----- In a screen with a number of complex GELs, you may want to specify the Before and After order for Bobs that are not in the same AnimOb. This will keep large objects together. If you do not do this, you may have an object drawn with half of its Bobs in front of another object! Also, in sequences you only set the Before and After pointers for the active AnimComp in the sequence. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
