TITLE: 28 / Using Bobs / Specifying the Shape of a Bob

28 / Using Bobs / Specifying the Shape of a Bob ]" border=0> The layout of the data of a Bob's image is different from that of a VSprite because of the way the system retrieves data to draw Bobs. VSprite images are organized in a way convenient to the Sprite hardware; Bob images are set up for easy blitter manipulation. The ImageData pointer is still initialized to point to the first word of the image definition. Note: ----- As with all image data, a Bob's ImageData must be in Chip memory for access by the blitter. The sample image below shows the same image defined as a VSprite in the " Using Virtual Sprites " section above. The data here, however, is laid out for a Bob. The shape is 2 planes deep and is triangular: mem 1111 1111 1111 1111 Least significant bit of sprite line 1 mem + 1 0011 1100 0011 1100 Least significant bit of sprite line 2 mem + 2 0000 1100 0011 0000 Least significant bit of sprite line 3 mem + 3 0000 0010 0100 0000 Least significant bit of sprite line 4 mem + 4 0000 0001 1000 0000 Least significant bit of sprite line 5 mem + 5 1111 1111 1111 1111 Most significant bit of sprite line 1 mem + 6 0011 0000 0000 1100 Most significant bit of sprite line 2 mem + 7 0000 1111 1111 0000 Most significant bit of sprite line 3 mem + 8 0000 0011 1100 0000 Most significant bit of sprite line 4 mem + 9 0000 0001 1000 0000 Most significant bit of sprite line 5 [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
