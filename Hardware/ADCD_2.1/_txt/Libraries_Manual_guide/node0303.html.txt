TITLE: 26 / Introduction / Sequence of Events During an Interrupt

26 / Introduction / Sequence of Events During an Interrupt ]" border=0> Before useful interrupt handling code can be executed, a considerable amount of hardware and software activity must occur. Each interrupt must propagate through several hardware and software interfaces before application code is finally dispatched: * A hardware device decides to cause an interrupt and sends a signal to the interrupt control portions of the 4703 (Paula) custom chip. * The 4703 interrupt control logic notices this new signal and performs two primary operations. First, it records that the interrupt has been requested by setting a flag bit in the INTREQ register. Second, it examines the INTENA register to determine whether the corresponding interrupt and the interrupt master are enabled. If both are enabled, the 4703 generates an interrupt request by placing the priority level of the request onto the three 68000 interrupt control input lines (IPL0, IPL1, IPL2). * These three signals correspond to seven interrupt priority levels in the 68000. If the priority of the new interrupt is greater than the current processor priority, an interrupt sequence is initiated. The priority level of the new interrupt is used to index into the top seven words of the processor address space. The odd byte (a vector number) of the indexed word is fetched and then shifted left by two to create an offset into the processor's auto-vector interrupt table. The vector offsets used are in the range of $064 to $07C. These are labeled as interrupt autovectors in the 68000 manual. The auto-vector table appears in low memory on a 68000 system, but its location for other 68000 family processors is determined by the processor's CPU Vector Base Register (VBR). VBR can be accessed from supervisor mode with the MOVEC instruction. * The processor then switches into supervisor mode (if it is not already in that mode), and saves copies of the status register and program counter (PC) onto the top of the system stack (additional information may be saved by processors other than the 68000). The processor priority is then raised to the level of the active interrupt. * From the low memory vector address (calculated in step three above), a 32-bit autovector address is fetched and loaded into the program counter. This is an entry point into Exec's interrupt dispatcher. * Exec must now further decode the interrupt by examining the INTREQ and INTENA 4703 chip registers. Once the active interrupt has been determined, Exec indexes into an ExecBase array to fetch the interrupt's handler entry point and handler data pointer addresses. * Exec now turns control over to the interrupt handler by calling it as if it were a subroutine. This handler may deal with the interrupt directly or may propagate control further by invoking interrupt server chain processing. You can see from the above discussion that the interrupt autovectors should never be altered by the user. If you wish to provide your own system interrupt handler, you must use the Exec SetIntVector() function. You should not change the contents of any autovector location. Task multiplexing usually occurs as the result of an interrupt. When an interrupt has finished and the processor is about to return to user mode, Exec determines whether task-scheduling attention is required. If a task was signaled during interrupt processing, the task scheduler will be invoked. Because Exec uses preemptive task scheduling, it can be said that the interrupt subsystem is the heart of task multiplexing. If, for some reason, interrupts do not occur, a task might execute forever because it cannot be forced to relinquish the CPU.
