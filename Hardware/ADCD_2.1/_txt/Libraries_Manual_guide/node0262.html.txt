15 / / The Kinds of GadTools Gadgets / Checkbox Gadgets ]" border=0> Checkboxes (CHECKBOX_KIND) are appropriate for presenting options which may be turned on or off. This kind of gadget consists of a raised box which contains a checkmark if the option is selected or is blank if the option is not selected. Clicking on the box toggles the state of the checkbox. The width and height of a checkbox are currently fixed (to 26x11). If variable-sized checkboxes are added in the future, they will be done in a compatible manner. Currently the width and height specified in the NewGadget structure are ignored. The checkbox may be controlled with the following tags: GTCB_Checked (BOOL) Set this attribute to TRUE to set the gadget's state to checked. Set it to FALSE to mark the gadget as unchecked. The default is FALSE. (Create and set.) GA_Disabled (BOOL) Set this attribute to TRUE to disable the checkbox, to FALSE otherwise. The default is FALSE. (Create and set.) When the user selects a checkbox, the program will receive an IntuiMessage with a class of IDCMP_GADGETUP . As this gadget always toggles, the program can easily track the state of the gadget. Feel free to read the Gadget->Flags GFLG_SELECTED bit. Note, however, that the Gadget structure itself is not synchronized to the IntuiMessages received. If the user clicks a second time, the GFLG_SELECTED bit can toggle again before the program gets a chance to read it. This is true of any of the dynamic fields of the Gadget structure, and is worth being aware of, although only rarely will an application have to account for it. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
