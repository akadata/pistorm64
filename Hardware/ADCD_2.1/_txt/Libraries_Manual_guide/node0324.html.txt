TITLE: 27 / / Viewport Size Specifications / ViewPort Height

27 / / Viewport Size Specifications / ViewPort Height ]" border=0> The DHeight field of the ViewPort structure determines how many video lines will be reserved to show the height of this display segment. The size of the actual segment depends on whether you define a non-interlaced or an interlaced display. An interlaced ViewPort displays twice as many lines as does a non-interlaced ViewPort in the same physical height. For example, a complete View consisting of two ViewPort s might be defined as follows: * ViewPort 1 is 150 lines, high-resolution mode (uses the top three-quarters of the display). * ViewPort 2 is 49 lines of low-resolution mode (uses the bottom quarter of the display and allows the space for the required blank line between ViewPorts). Initialize the height directly in DHeight. Nominal height for a non-interlaced display is 200 lines for NTSC, 256 for PAL. Nominal height for an interlaced display is 400 lines for NTSC, 512 for PAL. To set your ViewPort to the maximum supported (displayable) height, use the following code fragment (this requires Release 2): struct DimensionInfo querydims; struct Rectangle *oscan; struct ViewPort viewport; if (GetDisplayInfoData( NULL,(UBYTE *)&querydims, sizeof(struct DimensionInfo), DTAG_DIMS, modeID )) { /* Use StdOScan instead of MaxOScan to get standard */ /* overscan dimensions as set by the user in Overscan */ /* Preferences */ oscan = &querydims.MaxOScan; viewPort->DHeight = oscan->MaxY - oscan->MinY + 1; } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
