33 / IFF FORM Specifications / FORM FTXT ]" border=0> The FTXT (Formatted TeXT) form is the standard format for sharing text on the Amiga. The Release 2 console device clip and paste functions, in conjunction with the startup-sequence conclip command, pass clipped console text through the clipboard as FTXT. By supporting reading and writing of clipboard device FTXT, your application will allow users to cut and paste text between your application, other applications, and Amiga Shell windows. The FTXT form is very simple. Generally, for clip and paste operations, you will only be concerned with the CHRS (character string) chunks of an FTXT. There may be one or more CHRS chunks, each of which contains a non-NULL-terminated string of ASCII characters whose length is equal to the length ( StoredProperty.sp_Size ) of the chunk. Be aware that if you CollectionChunk() the CHRS chunks of an FTXT, the list accumulated by IFFParse will be in reverse order from the chunk order in the file. See the ClipFTXT.c example at the end of this chapter for a simple example of reading (and optionally writing) FTXT to and from the clipboard. See also the " Clipboard Device " and " Console Device " chapters of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices for more information on Release 2 console clip and paste.
