TITLE: 7 / True Requesters / Using a Requester to Block Window Input

7 / True Requesters / Using a Requester to Block Window Input ]" border=0> There may be times when an application needs to block user input without a visible requester. In some cases, the application needs to be busy for a while. Other times, an application wants the blocking properties of a requester, but prefers to use a window instead of a true requester. In this case, the application can create a requester with no imagery, attaching it to the parent window to block input. A new window may then be opened to act as the requester. Some of the advantages of using a window as a requester instead of a real requester include: * A window can be resized, and moves independently of the parent window. * It is legal to render directly into a window. * The window can have its own menus since only the parent window's menus are disabled (this is only occasionally useful). * Certain code or a library you are using may not work in requesters (GadTools library is an example of this). Of course, using a true requester instead of a window has the advantage that the requester automatically moves and depth-arranges along with the parent window.
