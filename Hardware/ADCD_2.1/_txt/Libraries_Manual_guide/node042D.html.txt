TITLE: 33 IFFParse Library / Stream Management

33 IFFParse Library / Stream Management ]" border=0> A stream is a linear array of bytes that may be accessed sequentially or randomly. DOS files are streams. IFFParse uses Release 2 Hook structures (defined in hooks.h >) to implement a general stream management facility. This allows the IFFParse library to read, write, and seek any type of file handle or device by using an application-provided hook function to open, read, write, seek and close the stream. Built on top of this facility, IFFParse has two internal stream managers: one for unbuffered DOS files (AmigaDOS filehandles), and one for the Clipboard.
