15 / GadTools Gadgets / Freeing Gadgets ]" border=0> After closing the window, the gadgets allocated using CreateGadget() must be released. FreeGadgets() is a simple call that will free all the GadTools gadgets that it finds, beginning with the gadget whose pointer is passed as an argument. void FreeGadgets( struct Gadget *gad ); The gad argument is a pointer to the first gadget to be freed. It is safe to call FreeGadgets() with a NULL gadget pointer, the function will then return immediately. Before calling FreeGadgets(), the application must first either remove the gadgets or close the window. When the gadget passed to FreeGadgets() is the first gadget in a linked list, the function frees all the GadTools gadgets on the list without patching pointers or trying to maintain the integrity of the list. Any non-GadTools gadgets found on the list will not be freed, hence the result will not necessarily form a nice list since any intervening GadTools gadgets will be gone. See the section on " Creating Gadget Lists " for more information on using linked lists of gadgets. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
