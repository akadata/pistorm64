TITLE: Amiga® RKM Libraries: 13 Preferences

Amiga® RKM Libraries: 13 Preferences ]" border=0> To make the Amiga operating system easily configurable by the user, the OS comes with a family of editors and associated data files known collectively as Preferences. Preferences allows the user to set system-wide configuration options such as the printer driver to use, serial port baud rate and other items. To make an application appealing to the user, the system-wide Preferences settings should be respected as much as possible by applications. This chapter describes how to use the Preferences system in your programs. In Release 2 the number of Preference items and the way they are handled is very different from 1.3 and earlier versions, though there is backward compatibility with old Preferences items. This chapter describes both the old 1.3 and the new Release 2 Preferences. Preferences in 1.3 and Older Versions of the OS Preferences in Release 2 Function Reference [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
