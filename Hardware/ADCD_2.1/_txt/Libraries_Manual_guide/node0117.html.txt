TITLE: 4 Intuition Windows / Preserving the Window Display

4 Intuition Windows / Preserving the Window Display ]" border=0> The layers library is what allows the display and manipulation of multiple overlapping rectangles, or layers. Intuition uses the layers library to manage its windows, by associating a layer to each window. Each window is a virtual display. When rendering, the application does not have to worry about the current size or position of its window, and what other windows might be partly or fully obscuring its window. The window's RastPort is the handle to the its virtual display space. Intuition and graphics library rendering calls will recognize that this RastPort belongs to a layer, and act accordingly. As windows are moved, resized, rearranged, opened, or closed, the on-screen representation changes. When part of a window which was visible now needs to appear in a new location, the layers library will move that imagery without involving the application. However, when part of a window that was previously obscured is revealed, or when a window is made larger, the imagery for the newly-visible part of the window needs to be redrawn. Intuition, through layers, offers three choices for how this is managed, trading off speed, memory usage, and application complexity. * The most basic type of window is called Simple Refresh. When any graphics operation takes place in this kind of window, the visible parts are updated, but rendering to the obscured parts is discarded. When the window arrangement changes to reveal a previously obscured part of such a window, the application must refresh that area. * Alternately, a window may be made Smart Refresh, which means that when rendering occurs, the system will not only update the visible parts of the window, but it will maintain the obscured parts as well, by using off-screen buffers. This means that when an obscured part of the window is revealed, the system will restore the imagery that belongs there. The application needs only to refresh parts of the window that appear when the window is made bigger. Smart Refresh windows use more memory than Simple Refresh windows (for the storage of obscured areas), but they are faster. * The third kind of window is called SuperBitMap. In such a window, the system can refresh the window even when it is sized bigger. For this to work, the application must store a complete bitmap for the window's maximum size. Such a window is more work to manage, and uses yet more memory. SuperBitMap windows are used less often than the other two types. Intuition helps your application manage window refresh. First, Intuition will take care of redrawing the window border and any system and application gadgets in the window. Your application never has to worry about that. Second, Intuition will notify your application when it needs to refresh its window (by sending the IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW event). Third, Intuition provides functions that restrict your rendering to the newly-revealed (damaged) areas only, which speeds up your refresh rendering and makes it look cleaner. The Intuition, layers, and graphics libraries work together to make rendering into and managing windows easy. You obtain your windows through Intuition, which uses the Layers library to manage the overlapping, resizing, and re-positioning of the window layers. The layers library is responsible for identifying the areas of each window that are visible, obscured but preserved off-screen, or obscured and not preserved. The rendering functions in the graphics library and Intuition library know how to render into the multiple areas that layers library establishes. Note that you may not directly manipulate layers on an Intuition screen. You cannot create your own layers on an Intuition screen, nor can you use the layers movement, sizing, or arrangement functions on Intuition windows. Use the corresponding Intuition calls instead. Some other Layers library calls (such as the locking calls ) are sometimes used on Intuition screens and windows.
