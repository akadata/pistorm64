TITLE: 17 / Libraries and Devices / Library Vector Offsets (LVOs)

17 / Libraries and Devices / Library Vector Offsets (LVOs) ]" border=0> After an application has successfully opened a library, it can start using the library's functions. To access a library function, an application needs the library base address returned by OpenLibrary() and the function's Library Vector Offset (LVO). A function's LVO is the offset from the library's base address to the function's vector in the vector table, which means an LVO is a negative number (the vectors precedes the library base in memory). Application code enters a library function by doing a jump to subroutine (the 680x0 instruction JSR) to the proper negative offset (LVO) from the address of the library base. The library vector itself is a jump instruction (the 680x0 instruction JMP) to the actual library function which is somewhere in memory.

A function's LVO is always the same on every system and is not subject to change. A function's jump vector can, and does, change. Assuming that a function's jump vector is static is very bad, so don't do it. Each library has four vectors set aside for library housekeeping: OPEN , CLOSE , EXPUNGE , and RESERVED . The OPEN vector points to a function that performs any custom initialization that this library needs, for example, opening other libraries that this library uses. The CLOSE function takes care of any clean up necessary when an application closes a library. The EXPUNGE vector points to a function that prepares the library for removal from the system. Normally the OS will not remove a library from memory until the system needs the memory the library occupies. The other vector, RESERVED, does not do anything at present and is reserved for future system use. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
