3 / Intuition Screens and Graphics Library / Changing Screen Colors ]" border=0> Screen colors are set at the time the screen is opened with the SA_Colors tag. If the colors need to be changed after the screen is opened, the graphics library function, LoadRGB4() should be used. To change a single entry in the color table, use SetRGB4() and SetRGB4CM(). See the " Graphics Primitives " chapter for more information on these functions. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
