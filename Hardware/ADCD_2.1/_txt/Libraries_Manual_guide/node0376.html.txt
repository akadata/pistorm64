28 / / Types Of GELs / VSprites vs. Bobs ]" border=0> If you are going to manage the movement and sequencing of GELS yourself, you need to decide if sprite animation (VSprites) or blitter animation (Bobs, AnimComps and AnimObs) best suit your needs. If you've got simple requirements or lots of coding time, you may even opt to use only Simple Sprites, and control them yourself. On the other hand if you want the system to manage your animations, AnimComps must be used and they are Bobs at heart. Some fundamental differences between VSprites and Bobs are: * VSprite images and coordinates currently low-resolution pixels, even on a high resolution display. Bob images and coordinates have the same resolution as the playfield they are rendered into. * VSprites have a maximum width of 16 (low resolution) pixels. Bobs can be any width (although large Bobs tend to slow down the system). The height of either VSprites or Bobs can be as tall as the display. * VSprites have a maximum of three colors (Simple Sprites can have fifteen if they're attached). Because the system uses the Copper to control VSprite colors on the fly, the colors are not necessarily the same as those in the background playfield. Bobs can use any or all of the colors in the background playfield. Limiting factors include playfield resolution and display time. Bobs with more colors take longer to display. * VSprites are positioned using absolute display coordinates, and don't move with screens. Bobs follow screen movement. In general, VSprites offer speed, while Bobs offer flexibility. The following figure shows how the various GEL data structures, VSprite s, Bobs and AnimComps are linked together.
