28 / / Animation Types / Sequenced Drawing ]" border=0> To make the ball appear to rotate is a little more complex. To produce apparent movement within the image, sequencing is used. This is done by having a stack of AnimComp 's that are laid down one after the other, a frame at a time. The stack can be arranged in a circular list for repeating movement. So, when you combine a sequence of drawings using AnimComps with simple motion control using an AnimOb , you can perform more complex animations such as having a rotating ball bounce around.
