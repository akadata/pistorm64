TITLE: 2 Intuition and the Graphical Interface / A Simple Intuition Program

2 Intuition and the Graphical Interface / A Simple Intuition Program ]" border=0> The sample Intuition program that follows shows all of the basic requirements for an Intuition application. There are three important points: * You must open the Intuition library before you can use the Intuition functions. Certain languages such as require the pointer to the Intuition library to be assigned to a variable called IntuitionBase (see Chapter 1 for more about this). * When you set up a window , you also specify the events that you want to know about. If the user performs some activity that triggers one of the events you specified, Intuition signals you and sends a message . The message is a pointer to an IntuiMessage data structure that describes the event in more detail. Messages about Intuition events are sent to a MsgPort structure which queues up the messages for you in a linked list so that you may respond to them at your convenience. * Resources must be returned to the system. In this case, any windows, screens or libraries that were opened are closed before exiting.
