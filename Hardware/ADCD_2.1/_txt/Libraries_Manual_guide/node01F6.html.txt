TITLE: 11 Intuition Special Functions / Locking IntuitionBase

11 Intuition Special Functions / Locking IntuitionBase ]" border=0> It is sometimes necessary to examine the IntuitionBase structure. Items such as the address of the active screen and window, current mouse coordinates and more can be found there. It is never a good idea to simply read these fields, as they are prone to sudden change. The IntuitionBase structure must always be locked before looking at its fields. It is necessary to inform Intuition that an application is about to examine IntuitionBase so that Intuition will not change any variables and IntuitionBase will remain static during the access. The call LockIBase() will lock the state of IntuitionBase so that it may be examined. During the time that the application has IntuitionBase locked, all Intuition input processing is frozen. Make every effort to examine IntuitionBase and release the lock as quickly as possible. The values in IntuitionBase are read-only. Applications should never write values to IntuitionBase. ULONG LockIBase( unsigned long dontknow ); LockIBase() is passed a ULONG (dontknow in the prototype above) indicating the Intuition lock desired. For all foreseeable uses of the call this value should be 0. LockIBase() returns a ULONG, that must be passed to UnlockIBase() later to allow IntuitionBase to change once again. Every call to LockIBase() must be matched by a subsequent call to UnlockIBase() : void UnlockIBase( unsigned long ibLock ); Set the ibLock argument to the value returned by the previous call to LockIBase() . About LockIBase(). ------------------ This function should not be called while holding any other system locks such as Layer and Layer_Info locks. Between calls to LockIBase() and UnlockIBase() , you may not call any Intuition or other high-level system functions so it is best to copy the information you need and release the lock as quickly as possible. About IntuitionBase. -------------------- Never, ever, modify any of the fields in IntuitionBase directly. Also, there are fields in IntuitionBase that are considered system private that should not be accessed, even for reading. (Refer to the intuitionbase > include file.) Application programs cannot depend on (and should not use) the contents of these fields; their usage is subject to change in future revisions of Intuition. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
