TITLE: B / propgclass / PGA_Top (ISGNU), PGA_Visible, PGA_Total (ISU)

B / propgclass / PGA_Top (ISGNU), PGA_Visible, PGA_Total (ISU) ]" border=0> These attributes replace the Pot and Body variables of the Release 1.3 prop gadget. They are based on the use of proportional gadgets to control scrolling text. When scrolling 100 lines of text in a 25 line visible window, you would set PGA_Total to 100, PGA_Visible to 25, and watch PGA_Top run from 0 to 75 (the top line of the last page). If the user clicks in the prop gadget but not on the knob, the entire knob jumps one "page" (the size of the visible area minus one, PGA_Visible-1). The page jump will leave an overlap of one line, unless the value PGA_Visible is 1, in which case the prop gadget acts as an integer numeric slider, sliding from 0 to PGA_Total - 1. Note that when PGA_Top changes, the gadget sends itself an OM_NOTIFY message about this attribute change (see the propgclass description of GM_HANDLEINPUT for more information). All three of these attributes have OM_UPDATE access, so they can be controlled from other objects. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
