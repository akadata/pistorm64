TITLE: B / strgclass / Attributes: STRINGA_MaxChars - STRINGA_WorkBuffer (I)

B / strgclass / Attributes: STRINGA_MaxChars - STRINGA_WorkBuffer (I) ]" border=0> STRINGA_MaxChars, STRINGA_Buffer, STRINGA_UndoBuffer, STRINGA_WorkBuffer (I) - Specify various buffers defined for string gadgets and extended string gadgets. If your value of STRINGA_MaxChars is less than SG_DEFAULTMAXCHARS (128 for now), then this class can provide all these buffers for you. Note that UndoBuffer and WorkBuffer can be shared by many separate gadgets, providing they are as large as the largest MaxChars they will encounter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
