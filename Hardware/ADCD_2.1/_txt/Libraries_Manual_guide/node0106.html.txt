4 / Basic Window Structures and Functions / Windows and Screens ]" border=0> Windows may be opened on one of three screen types: a custom screen, a public screen or the Workbench screen. A custom screen is one created and controlled by your application. Once you have set up a custom screen, you may open a window on it directly by calling one of the three open window functions. To open a window on a custom screen, call OpenWindowTagList() (or OpenWindowTags() ) with the WA_CustomScreen tag along with a pointer to the custom screen. This must be a pointer to a screen created by your application. For systems prior to Release 2, use the OpenWindow() call with NewWindow .Type set to CUSTOMSCREEN and NewWindow.Screen set to a pointer to your custom screen. You may choose to open a window on an existing public (shareable) screen instead of setting up your own custom screen. Such windows are often referred to as visitor windows because they "visit" a screen managed by the system or another application. For Workbench or other public screens that are not created and managed directly by your application, you must lock the screen before opening the window. This ensures that the screen remains open while your call to open the window is processed. One way to obtain a lock on a public screen is by calling the LockPubScreen() function (see the " Intuition Screens " chapter). Use WA_PubScreenName with NULL to open a visitor window on the default public screen (normally the Workbench screen). If a name is provided and the named screen exists, the visitor window will open on that named screen. In this case the system locks the named screen for you so there is no need to call LockPubScreen() directly. The open window call will fail if it cannot obtain a lock on the screen. If the WA_PubScreenFallBack tag is TRUE, the window will open on the default public screen when WA_PubScreenName can't be found. Another method to open a visitor window on a public screen is to use the WA_PubScreen tag along with a pointer to the Screen structure of the public screen obtained via LockPubScreen() . The application may also request the name of the "next" public screen, which allows windows to "jump" between public screens. This is done by closing the application window on the first screen and opening a new window on the next screen. (See the " Intuition Screens " chapter for more information on public and custom screens.) If no action is taken by the programmer to open the window on a specific screen, the window will open on the default public screen (normally the Workbench). This behavior is shown in the above example using OpenWindowTagList() . There are two global modes which come into play when a visitor window is opened on a public screen. If the global mode SHANGHAI is set, Workbench application windows will be opened on the default public screen. A second global mode, POPPUBSCREEN, forces a public screen to be moved to the front when a visitor window opens on it. These modes can be changed using SetPubScreenModes() , however, these should only be set according to the preferences of the user.
