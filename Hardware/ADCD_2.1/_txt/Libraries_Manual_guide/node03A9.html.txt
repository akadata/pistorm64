TITLE: 28 / Using Bobs / Double-Buffering

28 / Using Bobs / Double-Buffering ]" border=0> Double-buffering is the technique of supplying two different memory areas in which the drawing routines may create images. The system displays one memory space while drawing into the other area. This eliminates the "flickering" that is visible when a single display is being rendered into at the same time that it is being displayed. Double-buffering For One Means Double-buffering For All. -------------------------------------------------------- If any of the Bobs is double-buffered, then all of them must be double-buffered. To find whether a Bob is to be double-buffered, the system examines the pointer named DBuffer in the Bob structure. If this pointer has a value of NULL, the system does not use double-buffering for this Bob. For example: myBob.DBuffer = NULL; /* do this if this Bob is NOT double-buffered */ DBufPacket and Double-Buffering [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
