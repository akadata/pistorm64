4 / About Windows / Window System Gadgets ]" border=0> Each window may have a number of system gadgets which allow the user to control window size, shape and arrangement. These gadgets are: the drag bar, the depth gadget, the sizing gadget, the zoom gadget and the close gadget. The drag bar allows the user to change the position of the window with respect to the screen. The drag bar is in the top border of a window and occupies any space in the top border that is not used by other gadgets. The window may be dragged left, right, up and down on the screen, with the limitation that the entire window must remain within the screen's boundaries. This is done by positioning the pointer over the title bar, selecting the window and dragging to the new position. Window drag may be cancelled by pressing the right mouse button before the drag is completed. Figure 4-1: A Window with System Gadgets The depth gadget allows the user to depth arrange a window with respect to other windows on the screen. The depth gadget is always positioned in the upper right corner of the window. Clicking the depth gadget will move the frontmost window behind all other windows. If the window is not the frontmost, it will be moved to the front. Selecting the depth gadget with the Shift qualifier always moves the window to the back (behind other windows). The sizing gadget allows the user to change the size of the window. Sizing is subject to minimum and maximum values set by the application. Width and height are independent in a sizing operation. The sizing gadget is always positioned in the lower right corner of the window. It allows the user to drag this corner of the window to a new position relative to the upper left corner of the window, thus changing the width and height of the window. Window sizing using the sizing gadget may be cancelled by pressing the right mouse button before the size is completed. The zoom gadget allows the user to quickly alternate between two preset window size and position values. The zoom gadget is always placed immediately to the left of the depth gadget. If there is no depth gadget on the window, the zoom gadget will still appear next to where the depth gadget would have been. The close gadget performs no direct action on the window, rather it causes Intuition to send a message to the application to close the window. This allows the application to perform any required processing or to warn the user before it closes the window. The close gadget is always positioned in the upper left corner of the window.
