TITLE: 28 / / Simple Sprite Functions / Controlling Sprite DMA

28 / / Simple Sprite Functions / Controlling Sprite DMA ]" border=0> Two additional functions used with Simple Sprites are the graphics library macros ON_SPRITE and OFF_SPRITE. These macros can be used to control sprite DMA. OFF_SPRITE prevents the system from displaying any sprites, whether Simple Sprites or VSprites. ON_SPRITE restores the sprite display. Be Careful With OFF_SPRITE. --------------------------- The Intuition mouse pointer is a sprite. Thus, if OFF_SPRITE is used, Intuition's pointer will disappear too. Use care when calling OFF_SPRITE. The macro turns off sprite fetch DMA, so that no new sprite data is fetched. Whatever sprite data was last being displayed at this point will continue to be displayed for every line on the screen. This may lead to a vertical color bar if a sprite is being displayed when OFF_SPRITE is called. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
