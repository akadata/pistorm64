TITLE: B / gadgetclass / New Methods: GM_RENDER

B / gadgetclass / New Methods: GM_RENDER ]" border=0> This method tells a gadget to render itself. The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. GM_RENDER uses a custom message structure (defined in gadgetclass.h >): struct gpRender { ULONG MethodID; /* GM_RENDER */ struct GadgetInfo *gpr_GInfo; struct RastPort *gpr_RPort; /* all ready for use */ LONG gpr_Redraw; /* might be a "highlight pass" */ }; The GM_RENDER message contains a pointer to the Gadget's RastPort which it can use for rendering. The Gadget renders itself according to how much imagery it needs to replace. The gpr_Redraw field contains one of three values: GREDRAW_REDRAW Redraw the entire gadget. GREDRAW_UPDATE The user has manipulated the gadget changing the imagery. Update only that part of the gadget's imagery that is effected by the user manipulating the gadget (for example, the knob and scrolling field of the prop gadget). GREDRAW_TOGGLE If this gadget supports it, toggle to or from the highlighting imagery. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
