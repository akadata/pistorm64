TITLE: 19 / / I/O Request Completion / Closing the Device

19 / / I/O Request Completion / Closing the Device ]" border=0> You end device access by reversing the steps you did to access it. This means you close the device, deallocate the I/O request memory and delete the message port. In that order! Closing a device is how you tell Exec that you are finished using a device and any associated resources. This can result in housecleaning being performed by the device. However, before you close a device, you might have to do some housecleaning of your own. A device is closed by calling the CloseDevice() function. The CloseDevice() function does not return a value. It has this format: CloseDevice(IORequest); where IORequest is the I/O request used to open the device. You should not close a device while there are outstanding I/O requests, otherwise you can cause major and minor problems. Let's begin with the minor problem: memory. If an I/O request is outstanding at the time you close a device, you won't be able to reclaim the memory you allocated for it. The major problem: the device will try to respond to the I/O request. If the device tries to respond to an I/O request, and you've deleted the message port (which is covered below), you will probably crash the system. One solution would be to wait until all I/O requests you sent to the device return. This is not always practical if you've sent a few requests and the user wants to exit the application immediately. In that case, the only solution is to abort and remove any outstanding I/O requests. You do this with the functions AbortIO() and WaitIO() . They must be used together for cleaning up. AbortIO() will abort an I/O request, but will not prevent a reply message from being sent to the application requesting the abort. WaitIO() will wait for an I/O request to complete and remove it from the message port. This is why they must be used together. Be Careful With AbortIO() ! -------------------------- Do not AbortIO() an I/O request which has not been sent to a device. If you do, you may crash the system. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
