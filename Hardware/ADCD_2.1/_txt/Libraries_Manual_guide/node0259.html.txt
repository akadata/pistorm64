TITLE: 15 / GadTools Gadgets / The NewGadget Structure

15 / GadTools Gadgets / The NewGadget Structure ]" border=0> For most gadgets, the NewGadget structure is used to specify its common attributes. Additional attributes that are unique to specific kinds of gadgets are specified as tags sent to the CreateGadget() function (described below). The NewGadget structure is defined in gadtools.h > as: struct NewGadget { WORD ng_LeftEdge, ng_TopEdge; WORD ng_Width, ng_Height; UBYTE *ng_GadgetText; struct TextAttr *ng_TextAttr; UWORD ng_GadgetID; ULONG ng_Flags; APTR ng_VisualInfo; APTR ng_UserData; }; The fields of the NewGadget structure are used as follows: ng_LeftEdge, ng_TopEdge Define the position of the gadget being created. ng_Width and ng_Height Define the size of the gadget being created. ng_GadgetText Most gadgets have an associated label, which might be the text in a button or beside a checkmark. This field contains a pointer to the appropriate string. Note that only the pointer to the text is copied, the text itself is not. The string supplied must remain constant and valid for the life of the gadget. ng_TextAttr The application must specify a font to use for the label and any other text that may be associated with the gadget. ng_Flags Used to describe general aspects of the gadget, which includes where the label is to be placed and whether the label should be rendered in the highlight color. The label may be positioned on the left side, the right side, centered above, centered below or dead-center on the gadget. For most gadget kinds, the label is placed on the left side by default, exceptions will be noted. ng_GadgetID, ng_UserData These user fields are copied into the resulting Gadget structure. ng_VisualInfo This field must contain a pointer to an instance of the VisualInfo structure, which contains information needed to create and render GadTools gadgets. The VisualInfo structure itself is private to GadTools and subject to change. Use the specialized GadTools functions for accessing the VisualInfo pointer, defined below. Never access or modify fields within this structure. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
