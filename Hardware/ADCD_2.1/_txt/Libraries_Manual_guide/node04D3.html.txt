TITLE: B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_HITTEST

B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_HITTEST ]" border=0> This method returns TRUE if a point is within the old Image structure box defined by the Image structure's LeftEdge , TopEdge , Width , and Height fields. Subclasses of imageclass can redefine this method if they need to change the criteria for deciding if a point is within an image. Application programs should not call this method directly, instead use the Intuition function PointInImage() . The IM_HITTEST method uses a custom message structure: struct impHitTest { ULONG MethodID; /* IM_HITTEST */ struct { WORD X; /* Coordinates of point to test for hit */ WORD Y; } imp_Point; }; If an image object doesn't need to make any changes to how its superclass handles IM_HITTEST, it can blindly pass this method on to its superclass.
