27 / / Using the Graphics Drawing Routines / Rectangle-fill Operations ]" border=0> The final fill function, RectFill() , is for filling rectangular areas. The form of this function follows: RectFill(&rastPort, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax); As usual, the rastPort argument specifies the RastPort you want to draw into. The xmin and ymin arguments specify the upper left corner of the rectangle to be filled. The xmax and ymax arguments specify the lower right corner of the rectangle to be filled. Note that the variable xmax must be equal to or greater than xmin, and ymax must be equal to or greater than ymin. Rectangle-fill uses FgPen , BgPen , AOlPen , DrawMode , AreaPtrn and Mask to fill the area you specify. Remember that the fill can be multicolored as well as single- or two-colored. When the DrawMode is COMPLEMENT , it complements all bit planes, rather than only those planes in which the foreground is non-zero. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
