After this function is called, the Simple Sprite is moved to a new position relative to the upper left corner of the ViewPort . It is called as follows: struct ViewPort *vp; struct SimpleSprite *sprite; SHORT x, y; MoveSprite(vp, sprite, x, y); There are three inputs to MoveSprite() . Set the vp argument to the address of the ViewPort with which this Simple Sprite interacts or 0 if this Simple Sprite's position is relative only to the current View . Set sprite to the address of your SimpleSprite data structure. The x and y arguments sepcify a pixel position to which the Simple Sprite is to be moved. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
