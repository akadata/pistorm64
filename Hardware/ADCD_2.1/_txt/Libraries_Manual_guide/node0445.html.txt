TITLE: 33 IFFParse Library / Context Functions

33 IFFParse Library / Context Functions ]" border=0> Internally, IFFParse maintains IFF nesting and scoping context via a context stack. The PushChunk() and PopChunk() functions get their names from this basic idea of the iffparse.library. Direct access to this stack is not allowed. However, many functions are provided to assist in examining and manipulating the context stack. About the Context Stack. ------------------------ It is probably easier to think of a stack of blocks on a table in front of you when reading this discussion. As the nesting level increases (as would happen when parsing a nested LIST or FORM ), the depth of the context stack increases; new elements are added to the top. When these contexts expire, the ContextNode s are deleted and the stack shrinks.
