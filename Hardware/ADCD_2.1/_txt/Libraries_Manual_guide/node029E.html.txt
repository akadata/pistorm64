TITLE: 19 / Accessing a Device / Opening a Device

19 / Accessing a Device / Opening a Device ]" border=0> The device is opened by calling the OpenDevice() function. In addition to establishing the link to the device, OpenDevice() also initializes fields in the I/O request. OpenDevice() has this format: return = OpenDevice(device_name, unit_number, (struct IORequest *)IORequest, flags) * device_name is one of the following NULL-terminated strings for system devices: Audio .device Parallel .device Clipboard .device Printer .device Console .device scsi .device Gameport .device Serial .device Input .device Timer .device Keyboard .device Trackdisk .device Narrator .device * unit_number is refers to one of the logical units of the device. Devices with one unit always use unit 0. Multiple unit devices like the trackdisk device and the timer device use the different units for specific purposes. * IORequest is the structure discussed above . Some of the devices have their own I/O requests defined in their include files and others use standard I/O requests, ( IOStdReq ). Refer to the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices for more information. * flags are bits set to indicate options for some of the devices. This field is set to zero for devices which don't accept options when they are opened. The flags for each device are explained in the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices . * return is an indication of whether the OpenDevice() was successful with zero indicating success. Never assume that a device will successfully open. Check the return value and act accordingly. Zero Equals Success for OpenDevice() . ------------------------------------- Unlike most Amiga system functions, OpenDevice() returns zero for success and a device-specific error value for failure.
