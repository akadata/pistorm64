TITLE: 32 / / RigidDiskBlock and Alternate Filesystems / PartitionBlock

32 / / RigidDiskBlock and Alternate Filesystems / PartitionBlock ]" border=0> This is the current specification for the PartitionBlock. Note that while reading these blocks you may encounter partitions that are not to be mounted because the pb_HostID does not match, or because the pb_DriveName is in use and no fallback strategy exists, or because PBF._NOMOUNT is set, or because the proper filesystem cannot be found. Some partitions may be mounted but not be bootable because PBF._BOOTABLE is not set. pb_ID == 'PART' pb_SummedLongs == 64 pb_ChkSum block checksum (longword sum to zero) pb_HostID SCSI Target ID of host This describes the initiator ID for the owner of this partition. (see rdb_HostID discussion) pb_Next block number of the next PartitionBlock pb_Flags see below for defines PBF._BOOTABLE this partition is intended to be bootable (e.g. expected directories and files exist) PBF._NOMOUNT this partition description is to reserve space on the disk without mounting it. It may be manually mounted later. pb_Reserved1[2] set to zeros pb_DevFlags preferred flags for OpenDevice pb_DriveName preferred DOS device name: BSTR form This name is not to be used if it is already in use. Note that pb_Reserved2 will always be at least 4 longwords so that the RAM image of this record may be converted to the parameter packet to the expansion.library function MakeDosNode() . pb_Reserved2[15] filler to make 32 longwords so far The specification of the location of the partition is one of the components of the environment, below. If possible, describe the partition in a manner that tells the DOS about the physical layout of the partition: specifically, where the cylinder boundaries are. This allows the filesystem's smart block allocation strategy to work. pb_Environment[17] environment vector for this partition containing: de_TableSize size of Environment vector de_SizeBlock == 128 (for 512 bytes/logical block) de_SecOrg == 0 de_Surfaces number of heads (see layout discussion ) de_SectorPerBlock == 1 de_BlocksPerTrack blocks per track (see layout discussion ) de_Reserved DOS reserved blocks at start of partition. Must be >= 1. 2 is recommended. de_PreAlloc DOS reserved blocks at end of partition Valid only for filesystem type DOS^A (the fast file system). Zero otherwise. de_Interleave DOS interleave Valid only for filesystem type DOS^@ (the old file system). Zero otherwise. de_LowCyl starting cylinder de_HighCyl max cylinder de_NumBuffers initial # DOS of buffers. de_BufMemType type of mem to allocate for buffers The second argument to AllocMem(). de_MaxTransfer max number of bytes to transfer at a time. Drivers should be written to handle requests of any length. de_Mask address mask to block out certain memory Normally $00ffffff for DMA devices. de_BootPri Boot priority for autoboot Suggested value: zero. Keep less than five, so it won't override a boot floppy. de_DosType ASCII string showing filesystem type; DOS^@ ($444F5300) is old filesystem, DOS^A ($444F5301) is fast file system. UNI is a Unix partition. pb_EReserved[15] reserved for future environment vector [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
