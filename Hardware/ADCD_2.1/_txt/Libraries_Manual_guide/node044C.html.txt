TITLE: 33 / / Context-Specific Data: LocalContextItems / LocalItemData()

33 / / Context-Specific Data: LocalContextItems / LocalItemData() ]" border=0> To get a pointer to an LCI s data buffer, you use LocalItemData() : buf = LocalItemData (lci); You may read and write the buffer to your heart's content; it is yours. You should not, however, write beyond the end of the buffer. The size of the buffer is what you asked for when you called AllocLocalItem() . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
