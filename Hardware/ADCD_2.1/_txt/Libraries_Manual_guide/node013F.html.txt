TITLE: 5 / Gadget Highlighting / Highlighting by Color Complementing

5 / Gadget Highlighting / Highlighting by Color Complementing ]" border=0> Highlighting may be accomplished by complementing all of the colors in the gadget's select box. In this context, complementing means the complement of the binary number used to represent a particular color register. For example, if the color in color register 2 is used (binary 10) in a specific pixel of the gadget, the complemented value of that pixel will be the color in color register 1 (binary 01). To use this highlighting method, set the GFLG_GADGHCOMP flag. Only the select box of the gadget is complemented; any portion of the text, image, or border which is outside of the select box is not disturbed. See the chapter " Intuition Images, Line Drawing, and Text ," for more information about complementing and about color in general. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
