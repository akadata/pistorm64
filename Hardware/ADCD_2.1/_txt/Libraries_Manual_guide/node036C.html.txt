TITLE: 27 Graphics Primitives / ECS and Genlocking Features

27 Graphics Primitives / ECS and Genlocking Features ]" border=0> The Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) Denise chip (8373-R2a), coupled with the Release 2 graphics library, opens up a whole new set of genlocking possibilities. Unlike the old Denise, whose only genlocking ability allowed keying on color register zero, the ECS Denise allows keying on any color register. Also, the ECS Denise allows keying on any bitplane of the ViewPort being genlocked. With the ECS Denise, the border area surrounding the display can be made transparent (always passes video) or opaque (overlays using color 0). All the new features are set individually for each ViewPort. These features can be used in conjunction with each other, making interesting scenarios possible.
