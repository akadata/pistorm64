TITLE: 21 / Task Traps / Trap Handlers

21 / Task Traps / Trap Handlers ]" border=0> For compatibility with the 68000, Exec performs trap handling in supervisor mode . This means that all task switching is disabled during trap handling. At entry to the task's trap handler, the system stack contains a processor-dependent trap frame as defined in the 68000/10/20/30 manuals. A longword exception number is added to this frame. That is, when a handler gains control, the top of stack contains the exception number and the trap frame immediately follows. To return from trap processing, remove the exception number from the stack (note that this is the supervisor stack, not the user stack) and then perform a return from exception (RTE). Because trap processing takes place in supervisor mode , with task dispatching disabled, it is strongly urged that you keep trap processing as short as possible or switch back to user mode from within your trap handler. If a trap handler already exists when you add your own trap handler, it is smart to propagate any traps that you do not handle down to the previous handler. This can be done by saving the previous address from tc_TrapCode and having your handler pass control to that address if the trap which occurred is not one you wish to handle. The following example installs a simple trap handler which intercepts processor divide-by-zero traps, and passes on all other traps to the previous default trap code. The example has two code modules which are linked together. The trap handler code is in assembler. The C module installs the handler, demonstrates its effectiveness, then restores the previous tc_TrapCode . trap_c.c example [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
