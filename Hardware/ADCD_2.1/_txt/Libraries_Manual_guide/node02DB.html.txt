TITLE: 23 / List Structure / List Header Structure Definition

23 / List Structure / List Header Structure Definition ]" border=0> As mentioned earlier, a list header maintains memory pointers to the first and last nodes of the linked chain of nodes. It also serves as a handle for referencing the entire list. The minimum list header ("mlh_") and the full-featured list header ("lh_") are generally interchangeable. The structure MinList defines a minimum list header. struct MinList { struct MinNode *mlh_Head; struct MinNode *mlh_Tail; struct MinNode *mlh_TailPred; }; mlh_Head points to the first node in the list. mlh_Tail is always NULL. mlh_TailPred points to the last node in the list. In a few limited cases a full-featured List structure will be required: struct List { struct Node *lh_Head; struct Node *lh_Tail; struct Node *lh_TailPred; UBYTE lh_Type; UBYTE lh_Pad; }; lh_Type defines the type of nodes within the list (see nodes.h >). lh_pad is a structure alignment byte. One subtlety here must be explained further. The list header is constructed in an efficient, but confusing manner. Think of the header as a structure containing the head and tail nodes for the list. The head and tail nodes are placeholders, and never carry data. The head and tail portions of the header actually overlap in memory. lh_Head and lh_Tail form the head node; lh_Tail and lh_TailPred form the tail node. This makes it easy to find the start or end of the list, and eliminates any special cases for insertion or removal. ___________ ___________ | | | | | ln_Succ | | lh_Head | |___________|___________ |___________| | | | | | | ln_Pred=0 | ln_Succ=0 | | lh_Tail=0 | |___________|___________| ____\ |___________| | | / | | | ln_Pred | |lh_TailPred| |___________| |___________| Figure 23-2: List Header Overlap The lh_Head and lh_Tail fields of the list header act like the ln_Succ and lh_Pred fields of a node. The lh_Tail field is set permanently to NULL, indicating that the head node is indeed the first on the list -- that is, it has no predecessors. See the figure above. Likewise, the lh_Tail and lh_TailPred fields of the list header act like the ln_Succ and lh_Pred fields of a node. Here the NULL lh_Tail indicates that the tail node is indeed the last on the list -- that is, it has no successors. See the figure above. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
