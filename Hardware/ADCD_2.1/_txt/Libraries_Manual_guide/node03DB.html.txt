TITLE: 29 Graphics Library and Text / Font Scaling and Aspect Ratio

29 Graphics Library and Text / Font Scaling and Aspect Ratio ]" border=0> The Release 2 OS offers a significant improvement over the Amiga's previous font resources: it now has the ability to scale fonts to new sizes and dimensions. This means, if the diskfont.library can't find the font size an application requests, it can create a new bitmap font by scaling the bitmap of a different size font in the same font family. The 2.04 (V37) release of the OS improved upon the diskfont.library's font scaling ability so the Amiga now can utilize AGFA Compugraphic outline fonts, yielding scalable fonts that don't have the exaggerated jagged edges inherent in bitmap scaling. The best thing about the Amiga's font scaling is that its addition to the system is completely invisible to an application program. Because the diskfont.library takes care of all the font scaling, any program that uses OpenDiskFont() to open a font can have scalable fonts available to it. For simple scaling, the programming interface is the same using Release 2 as it was under 1.3. However, there is one feature of the Release 2 diskfont.library that the 1.3 programming interface cannot handle. When scaling a font (either from an outline or from another bitmap), the Release 2 diskfont.library can adjust the width of a font's glyphs according to an aspect ratio passed to OpenDiskFont() . A font glyph is the graphical representations associated with each symbol or character of a font. The aspect ratio refers to the shape of the pixels that make up the bitmap that diskfont.library creates when it scales a font. This ratio is the width of a pixel to the height of the pixel (XWidth/ YWidth). The diskfont.library uses this ratio to figure out how wide to make the font glyphs so that the look of a font's glyphs will be the same on display modes with very different aspect ratios. To add this new feature, several changes to the OS were necessary: 1) The OS needed to be able to store an aspect ratio for any font loaded into the system list. 2) The structures that diskfont.library uses to store bitmap fonts on disk had to be updated so they can store the aspect ratio a font was designed for. 3) The way in which an application requests fonts from diskfont.library had to be altered so that an application could ask for a specific aspect ratio. For the diskfont.library to be able to scale a font to a new aspect ratio, it needs to know what the font's current aspect ratio is. The Amiga gets the aspect ratio of a font currently in the system list from an extension to the TextFont structure called (oddly enough) TextFontExtension . Under Release 2, when the system opens a new font (and there is sufficient memory), it creates this extension. A font's TextFont structure contains a pointer to its associated TextFontExtension . While the font is opened, the TextFont's tf_Message.mn_ReplyPort field points to a font's TextFontExtension. The text.h > include file #defines tf_Message.mn_ReplyPort as tf_Extension. The TextFontExtension structure contains only one field of interest: a pointer to a tag list associated with this font: struct TagItem *tfe_Tags; /* Text Tags for the font */ If a font has an aspect ratio associated with it, the OS stores the aspect ratio as a tag/value pair in the tfe_Tags tag list. The TA_DeviceDPI tag holds a font's aspect ratio. The data portion of the TA_DeviceDPI tag contains an X DPI (dots per inch) value in its upper word and a Y DPI value in its lower word. These values are unsigned words (UWORD). At present, these values do not necessarily reflect the font's true X and Y DPI, so their specific values are not relevant. At present, only the ratio of the X aspect to the Y aspect is important (more on this later in the article). Notice that the X and Y DPI values are not aspect values. The X and Y aspect values are the reciprocals of the X and Y DPI values, respectively: XDPI = 1/XAspect YDPI = 1/YAspect so, the aspect ratio is YDPI/XDPI, not XDPI/YDPI. Before accessing the tag list, an application should make sure that this font has a corresponding TextFontExtension . The ExtendFont() function will return a value of TRUE if this font already has an extension or ExtendFont() was able to create an extension for this font. The Amiga has a place to store a font's X and Y DPI values once the font is loaded into memory, but where do these X and Y values come from? A font's X and Y DPI values can come from several sources. The X and Y DPI can come from a font's disk-based representation, or it can be set by the programmer. For the traditional Amiga bitmap fonts, in order to store the X and Y DPI values in a bitmap font's ".font" file, the structures that make up the ".font" file had to be expanded slightly. See the discussion of the FontContentsHeader structure in the " Composition of a Bitmap Font on Disk " section later in this chapter for more information. Currently, out of all the system standard bitmap fonts (those loaded from bitmaps on disk or ROM, not scaled from a bitmap or outline), only one has a built in aspect ratio: Topaz-9. For the Compugraphic outline fonts, the X and Y DPI values are built into the font outline. Because the format of the Compugraphic outline fonts is proprietary, information about their layout is available only from AGFA Compugraphic. For most people, the format of the outline fonts is not important, as the diskfont.library handles converting the fonts to an Amiga-usable form. The other place where a font can get an aspect ratio is an application. When an application opens a font with OpenDiskFont() , it can supply the TA_DeviceDPI tag that the diskfont.library uses to scale (if necessary) the font according to the aspect ratio. To do so, an application has to pass OpenDiskFont() an extended version of the TextAttr structure called the TTextAttr : struct TTextAttr { STRPTR tta_Name; /* name of the font */ UWORD tta_YSize; /* height of the font */ UBYTE tta_Style; /* intrinsic font style */ UBYTE tta_Flags; /* font preferences and flags */ struct TagItem *tta_Tags; /* extended attributes */ }; The TextAttr and the TTextAttr are identical except that the tta_Tags field points to a tag list where you place your TA_DeviceDPI tag. To tell OpenDiskFont() that it has a TTextAttr structure rather than a TextAttr structure, set the FSF_TAGGED bit in the tta_Style field. For example, to ask for Topaz-9 scaled to an aspect ratio of 75 to 50 the code might look something like this: #define MYXDPI (75L tf_Extension))->tfe_Tags); if (dpi) printf("XDPI = %d YDPI = %d\n", ((dpi & 0xFFFF0000)>>16), (dpi & 0x0000FFFF)); . . . /* Blah Blah print blah */ CloseFont(myfont); } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
