TITLE: 28 / / Types Of GELs / Bobs and AnimComps

28 / / Types Of GELs / Bobs and AnimComps ]" border=0> Like VSprites, Bobs and AnimComps are graphics objects that make animation easier. They are rendered using the blitter. The blitter is a special Amiga hardware component used to move data quickly and efficiently, optionally performing logical operations as it does. It can be used to move any kind of data but is especially well suited to moving rectangular blocks of display data. It is important to keep in mind that Bobs and AnimComps are based on the blitter hardware while VSprites use the sprite hardware. However all three GEL types use the VSprite structure as their root data structure. The system uses pointers to link the VSprite, Bob and AnimComp structures, "extending" the VSprite structure to include all GEL types. Since Bobs and AnimComps are rendered with the blitter they actually change the underlying playfield BitMap . The BitMap area where the GEL is rendered can be saved. By moving the GEL to new locations in small increments while also saving and restoring the Bitmap as you proceed, you can create an animation effect. Bobs and AnimComps use the same coordinates as the playfield and can be any size. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
