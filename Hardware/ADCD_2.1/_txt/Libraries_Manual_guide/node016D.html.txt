5 / String Gadget Type / Extended String Gadgets ]" border=0> The StringInfo structure may be extended by setting the GFLG_STRINGEXTEND gadget flag and placing a pointer to a StringExtend structure in the StringInfo Extension variable. GFLG_STRINGEXTEND is available beginning with V37, under V36 the application must use GACT_STRINGEXTEND to get the same functionality. Note that GACT_STRINGEXTEND is not ignored prior to V36 and should only be set in V36 or later systems. GFLG_STRINGEXTEND is ignored prior to V37. struct StringExtend { struct TextFont *Font; UBYTE Pens[2]; UBYTE ActivePens[2]; ULONG InitialModes; struct Hook *EditHook; UBYTE *WorkBuffer; ULONG Reserved[4]; }; Font If a font is specified in the StringExtend structure, that font will be used by the gadget. By default, the string gadget inherits the font of the screen on which it appears. Note that this is a pointer to an open font and not a pointer to a TextAttr structure. Proportional fonts are supported in string gadgets starting with Release 2. If the select box of the gadget is not tall enough to render the font, Intuition will fall back to topaz 8. Pens Pens specify the pens used to render the text while the gadget is inactive. Pens[0] is the foreground (text) pen, Pens[1] is the background pen. ActivePens ActivePens specify the pens used to render the text while the gadget is active. ActivePens[0] is the foreground (text) pen, ActivePens[1] is the background pen. InitialModes These modes may be used in StringExtend structure InitialModes field. SGM_REPLACE If this flag is set, the string gadget will be in replace or overwrite mode. If this flag is cleared, the string gadget will be in insert mode. In replace mode, characters entered overwrite the existing characters. In insert mode, characters entered are inserted into the buffer and the following characters are advanced by one position until the buffer is full. If the buffer is full in insert mode then characters may not be entered until some are deleted. When using this flag, always initialize StringInfo with an in-range value of BufferPos . While most changes to gadgets require the application to first remove the gadget before modifying the gadget, this flag may be toggled without removing the gadget from the gadget list. The change will take effect on the next character typed by the user. SGM_NOFILTER Don't filter control chars, enter them into the gadget as typed. In this mode the control character command keys for string gadgets are not active. If the user disables control character filtering from the IControl Preferences editor, there is no way for the application to turn it on for an individual string gadget. In filter mode, control characters may be entered into the string by holding the left Amiga key while the character is entered. While most changes to gadgets require the application to first remove the gadget before modifying the gadget, this flag may be toggled without removing the gadget from the gadget list. The change will take effect on the next character typed by the user. SGM_FIXEDFIELD Fixed length buffer used for editing, the user cannot shorten or lengthen the string through edit operations. The field length is taken from the length of the character string in the buffer when the gadget is added to the system. Fixed field mode modifies the meanings of many of the string editing keys, as explained in the tables above. Always set SGM_REPLACE when using a fixed length buffer. SGM_EXITHELP Allows the help key to be heard by the application from within string gadgets. The gadget will exit immediately when the help key is pressed with the IntuiMessage.Code set to 0x5F (new for V37). EditHook and WorkBuffer EditHook and WorkBuffer are used for custom string editing, which is discussed below . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
