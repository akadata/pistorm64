26 / Introduction / Interrupt Priorities ]" border=0> Interrupts are prioritized in hardware and software. The 68000 CPU priority at which an interrupt executes is determined strictly by hardware. In addition to this, the software imposes a finer level of pseudo-priorities on interrupts with the same CPU priority. These pseudo-priorities determine the order in which simultaneous interrupts of the same CPU priority are processed. Multiple interrupts with the same CPU priority but a different pseudo-priority will not interrupt one another. Interrupts are serviced by either an exclusive handler or by server chains to which many servers may be attached, as shown in the Type field of the table. The table above summarizes all interrupts by priority. The 8520s (also called CIAs) are Amiga peripheral interface adapter chips that generate the INT2 and INT6 interrupts. For more information about them, see the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual. As described in the Motorola 68000 programmer's manual, interrupts may nest only in the direction of higher priority. Because of the time-critical nature of many interrupts on the Amiga, the CPU priority level must never be changed by user or system code. When the system is running in user mode (multitasking), the CPU priority level must remain set at zero. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU priority is raised to the level appropriate for that interrupt. Lowering the CPU priority would permit unlimited interrupt recursion on the system stack and would "short-circuit" the interrupt-priority scheme. Because it is dangerous on the Amiga to hold off interrupts for any period of time, higher-level interrupt code must perform its business and exit promptly. If it is necessary to perform a time-consuming operation as the result of a high-priority interrupt, the operation should be deferred either by posting a software interrupt or by signalling a task. In this way, interrupt response time is kept to a minimum. Software interrupts are described in a later section. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
