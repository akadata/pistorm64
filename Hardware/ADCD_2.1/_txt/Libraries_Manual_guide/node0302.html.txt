TITLE: 26 Exec Interrupts / Introduction

26 Exec Interrupts / Introduction ]" border=0> Exec manages the decoding, dispatching, and sharing of all system interrupts. This includes control of hardware interrupts, software interrupts, task-relative interrupts (see the discussion of exceptions in the " Exec Tasks " chapter), and interrupt disabling and enabling. In addition, Exec supports a more extended prioritization of interrupts than that provided in the 68000. The proper operation of multitasking depends heavily on the consistent management of the interrupt system. Task activities are often driven by intersystem communication that is originated by various interrupts.
