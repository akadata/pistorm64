TITLE: D / Errors / Fails only on 68000

D / Errors / Fails only on 68000 ]" border=0> The following programming practices can be the cause of this problem: software delay loops; word or longword access of an odd address (illegal on the 68000). Note that this can occur under 2.0 if you reference IntuiMessage->IAddress as a structure pointer without first determining that the IntuiMessage 's Class is defined as having a structure pointer in its IAddress; use of the assembler CLR instruction on a hardware register which is triggered by any access. The 68000 CLR instruction performs two accesses (read and write) while 68020/30 CLR does a single write access. Use MOVE instead; assumptions about the order in which asynchronous tasks will finish; use of compiler flags which have generated inline 68881/68882 math coprocessor instructions or 68020/30 specific code.
