12 / / Using Boopsi / What About the Boopsi Messages and Methods? ]" border=0> According to the " OOP Overview " section, for an object to perform a method, something has to pass it a Boopsi message. The previous section discussed using Intuition functions to ask an object to do things like set and get attributes. The functions in the previous section seem to completely ignore all that material about methods and messages. What happened to the methods and messages? Nothing--these functions don't ignore the OOP constructs, they just shield the programmer from them. Each of these functions corresponds to a Boopsi method: NewObject() OM_NEW DisposeObject() OM_DISPOSE SetAttrs()/SetGadgetAttrs() OM_SET GetAttr() OM_GET These methods are defined on the rootclass level, so all Boopsi classes inherit them. The Intuition functions that correspond to these methods take care of constructing and sending a Boopsi message with the appropriate method ID and parameters. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
