TITLE: Amiga® RKM Libraries: 23 Exec Lists and Queues

Amiga® RKM Libraries: 23 Exec Lists and Queues ]" border=0> The Amiga system software operates in a dynamic environment of data structures. An early design goal of Exec was to keep the system flexible and open-ended by eliminating artificial boundaries on the number of system structures used. Rather than using static system tables, Exec uses dynamically created structures that are added and removed as needed. These structures can be put in an unordered list, or in an ordered list known as a queue. A list can be empty, but never full. This concept is central to the design of Exec. Understanding lists and queues is important to understanding not only Exec itself, but also the mechanism behind the Amiga's message and port based interprocess communication. Exec uses lists to maintain its internal database of system structures. Tasks, interrupts, libraries, devices, messages, I/O requests, and all other Exec data structures are supported and serviced through the consistent application of Exec's list mechanism. Lists have a common data structure, and a common set of functions is used for manipulating them. Because all of these structures are treated in a similar manner, only a small number of list handling functions need be supported by Exec.
