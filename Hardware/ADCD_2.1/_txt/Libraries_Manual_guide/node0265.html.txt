15 / / The Kinds of GadTools Gadgets / Slider Gadgets ]" border=0> Sliders are one of the two kinds of proportional gadgets offered by GadTools. Slider gadgets (SLIDER_KIND) are used to control an amount, a level or an intensity, such as volume or color. Scroller gadgets (SCROLLER_KIND) are discussed below. Slider gadgets accept the following tags: GTSL_Min (WORD) The minimum level of a slider. The default is zero. (Create and set.) GTSL_Max (WORD) The maximum level of a slider. The default is 15. (Create and set.) GTSL_Level (WORD) The current level of a slider. The default is zero. When the level is at its minimum, the knob will be all the way to the left for a horizontal slider or all the way at the bottom for a vertical slider. Conversely, the maximum level corresponds to the knob being to the extreme right or top. (Create and set.) GTSL_LevelFormat (STRPTR) The current level of the slider may be displayed in real-time alongside the gadget. To use the level-display feature, the program must be using a monospace font for this gadget. GTSL_LevelFormat specifies a printf() -style formatting string used to render the slider level beside the slider (the complete set of formatting options is described in the Exec library function RawDoFmt() ). Be sure to use the `l' (long word) modifier for the number. Field-width specifiers may be used to ensure that the resulting string is always of constant width. The simplest would be "%2ld". A 2-digit hexadecimal slider might use "%02lx", which adds leading zeros to the number. Strings with extra text, such as "%3ld hours", are permissible. If this tag is specified, the program must also provide GTSL_MaxLevelLen. By default, the level is not displayed. (Create only.) GTSL_MaxLevelLen (UWORD) The maximum length of the string that will result from the given level-formatting string. If this tag is specified, the program must also provide GTSL_LevelFormat. By default, the level is not displayed. (Create only.) GTSL_LevelPlace To choose where the optional display of the level is positioned. It must be one of PLACETEXT_LEFT, PLACETEXT_RIGHT, PLACETEXT_ABOVE or PLACETEXT_BELOW. The level may be placed anywhere with the following exception: the level and the label may not be both above or both below the gadget. To place them both on the same side, allow space in the gadget's label (see the example). The default is PLACETEXT_LEFT. (Create only.) GTSL_DispFunc (LONG (*function)(struct Gadget *, WORD)) Optional function to convert the level for display. A slider to select the number of colors for a screen may operate in screen depth (1 to 5, for instance), but actually display the number of colors (2, 4, 8, 16 or 32). This may be done by providing a GTSL_DispFunc function which returns 1 Gadget as the first parameter and the level, a WORD, as the second and return the result as a LONG. The default behavior for displaying a level is to do so without any conversion. (Create only.) GA_Immediate (BOOL) Set this to TRUE to receive an IDCMP_GADGETDOWN IntuiMessage when the user presses the mouse button over the slider. The default is FALSE. (Create only.) GA_RelVerify (BOOL) Set this to TRUE to receive an IDCMP_GADGETUP IntuiMessage when the user releases the mouse button after using the slider. The default is FALSE. (Create only.) PGA_Freedom Specifies which direction the knob may move. Set to LORIENT_VERT for a vertical slider or LORIENT_HORIZ for a horizontal slider. The default is LORIENT_HORIZ. (Create only.) GA_Disabled (BOOL) Set this attribute to TRUE to disable the slider, to FALSE otherwise. The default is FALSE. (Create and set.) Up to three different classes of IntuiMessage may be received at the port when the user plays with a slider, these are IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE , IDCMP_GADGETUP and IDCMP_GADGETDOWN . The program may examine the IntuiMessage Code field to discover the slider's level. IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE IntuiMessage s will be heard whenever the slider's level changes. IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE IntuiMessages will not be heard if the knob has not moved far enough for the level to actually change. For example if the slider runs from 0 to 15 and is currently set to 12, if the user drags the slider all the way up the program will hear no more than three IDCMP_MOUSEMOVEs, one each for 13, 14 and 15. If {GA_Immediate, TRUE} is specified, then the program will always hear an IDCMP_GADGETDOWN IntuiMessage when the user begins to adjust a slider. If {GA_RelVerify, TRUE} is specified, then the program will always hear an IDCMP_GADGETUP IntuiMessage when the user finishes adjusting the slider. If IDCMP_GADGETUP or IDCMP_GADGETDOWN IntuiMessages are requested, the program will always hear them, even if the level has not changed since the previous IntuiMessage. Note that the Code field of the IntuiMessage structure is a UWORD, while the slider's level may be negative, since it is a WORD. Be sure to copy or cast the IntuiMessage->Code into a WORD if the slider has negative levels. If the user clicks in the container next to the knob, the slider level will increase or decrease by one. If the user drags the knob itself, then the knob will snap to the nearest integral position when it is released. Here is an example of the screen-depth slider discussed earlier: /* NewGadget initialized here. Note the three spaces * after "Slider:", to allow a blank plus the two digits * of the level display */ ng.ng_Flags = PLACETEXT_LEFT; ng.ng_GadgetText = "Slider: "; LONG DepthToColors(struct Gadget *gad, WORD level) { return ((WORD)(1 [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
