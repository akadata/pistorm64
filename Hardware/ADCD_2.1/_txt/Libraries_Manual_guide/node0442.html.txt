33 / / Creating Chunks In a File / PopChunk() ]" border=0> When you are through writing data to a chunk, you complete the write by calling PopChunk() : error = PopChunk (iff); If you wrote fewer bytes than you declared with PushChunk() , PopChunk() will return an error. If you specified IFFSIZE_UNKNOWN, PopChunk() will seek backward on the stream and write the final size. If you specified a chunk size that was odd, PopChunk() will write the pad byte automatically. PushChunk() and PopChunk() nest; every call to PushChunk() must have a corresponding call to PopChunk(). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
