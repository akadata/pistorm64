28 / / Setting Up For Boundary Collisions ]" border=0> To specify the region in the playfield that the system will use to define the outermost limits of the GEL boundaries, you use these GelsInfo members: topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost . The DoCollision() routine tests these boundaries when determining boundary collisions within this RastPort . They have nothing whatsoever to do with graphical clipping. Graphical clipping makes use of the RastPort's clipping rectangle. Here is a typical program segment that assigns the members correctly (for boundaries 50, 100, 80, 240). It assumes that you already have a RastPort structure pointer named myRastPort. myRastPort->GelsInfo->topmost = 50; myRastPort->GelsInfo->bottommost = 100; myRastPort->GelsInfo->leftmost = 80; myRastPort->GelsInfo->rightmost = 240; Parameters To Your Boundary Collision Routine Parameters To Your Inter-GEL Collision Routines Handling Multiple Collisions [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
