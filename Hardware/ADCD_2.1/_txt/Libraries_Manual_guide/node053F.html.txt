D / Errors / Crashes--Subtasks, Interrupts ]" border=0> If part of your code runs on a different stack or the system stack, you must turn off compiler stack-checking options. If part of your code is called directly by the system or by other tasks, you must use long code/long data or use special compiler flags or options to assure that the correct base registers are set up for your subtask or interrupt code.
