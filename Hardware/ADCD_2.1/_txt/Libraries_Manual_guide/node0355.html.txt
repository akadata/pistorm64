27 / Drawing Routines / Using the Graphics Drawing Routines ]" border=0> This section shows you how to use the Amiga drawing routines. All of these routines work either on their own or along with the windowing system and layers library. For details about using the layers and windows, see the chapters on " Layers Library " and " Intuition Windows". Use WaitBlit(). --------------- The graphics library rendering and data movement routines generally wait to get access to the blitter, start their blit, and then exit. Therefore, you must WaitBlit() after a graphics rendering or data movement call if you intend to immediately deallocate, examine, or perform order-dependent processor operations on the memory used in the call. As you read this section, keep in mind that to use the drawing routines, you need to pass them a pointer to a RastPort . You can define the RastPort directly, as shown in the sample program segments in preceding sections, or you can get a RastPort from your Window structure using code like the following: struct Window *window; struct RastPort *rastPort; window = OpenWindow(&newWindow); /* You could use OpenWindowTags() */ if (window) rastPort = window->RPort; You can also get the RastPort from the Layer structure, if you are not using Intuition.
