TITLE: 3 / / Screen Functions That Integrate Intuition and Graphics

3 / / Screen Functions That Integrate Intuition and Graphics ]" border=0> These functions, normally used only by the system, integrate high-level Intuition structures with the lower-level constructs used by the graphics library to create the display. Table 3-9: Screen Functions That Integrate Intuition and Graphics _______________________________________________________________________ | | | MakeScreen() Update a single screen's copper list | | | | RethinkDisplay() Merge copper lists from all screens to form a View | | | | RemakeDisplay() Update all screen copper lists then merge them to | | form a View | |_______________________________________________________________________| Advanced Intuition programmers may use these functions to achieve special screen effects such as double-buffering or dual-playfield Intuition screens. For examples of these see the next section. MakeScreen() updates, but does not install, a screen's Copper list. This function is the Intuition equivalent of the low-level MakeVPort() graphics library function. MakeScreen() performs the MakeVPort() call, synchronized with Intuition's own use of the screen's ViewPort . Call RethinkDisplay() after MakeScreen() to allow the new Copper list for the screen to take effect. The MakeScreen() function takes one argument, a pointer to the Screen that contains the Copper list to be updated. RethinkDisplay() combines all the screen's copper lists into a single view. This procedure performs the Intuition global display reconstruction, which includes massaging some of Intuition's internal state data, rethinking all of the Intuition screen ViewPorts and their relationship to one another, and, finally, reconstructing the entire display by merging the new screens into the graphics View structure. Custom screens that handle their own Copper instructions, use this call to install the Copper list previously updated with MakeScreen(). RethinkDisplay() calls lower-level graphics primitives MrgCop() and LoadView() to install the Copper list. This function takes no arguments. RemakeDisplay() remakes the entire Intuition display. It is equivalent to calling MakeScreen() for each screen in the system, then calling RethinkDisplay(). This routine performs a MakeVPort() (graphics primitive) on every Intuition screen and then calls RethinkDisplay() to recreate the View . It takes no arguments. Both RemakeDisplay() and RethinkDisplay() take several milliseconds to run and lock out all other tasks while they run. This can seriously degrade system performance, so do not use these routines lightly. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
