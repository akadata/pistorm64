TITLE: 6 / Setting Up Menus / Simple Menu Example

6 / Setting Up Menus / Simple Menu Example ]" border=0> Menu concepts are explained in great detail later in this chapter; for now though it may be helpful to look at an example. Here is a very simple example of how to use the Intuition menu system. The example shows how to set up a menu strip consisting of a single menu with five menu items. The third menu item in the menu has two sub-items. The example works with all versions of the Amiga OS however it assumes that the Workbench screen is set up with the the Topaz 8 ROM font. If the font is different, the example will exit immediately since the layout of the menus depends on having a monospaced font with 8 x 8 pixel characters. simplemenu.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
