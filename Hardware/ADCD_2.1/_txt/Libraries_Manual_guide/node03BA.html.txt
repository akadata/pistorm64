28 / Animation with GELs / Animation Types ]" border=0> The GELs system provides several ways of setting up automatic animation, loosely based on some categories of movement in real life. Some things (like balls or arrows) can move independently of the background, and look even more realistic if they tumble or rotate as they move; other things (like worms, wheels, and people) must be anchored to the background, or they will appear to slide unnaturally. The system software allows these types of animation through simple motion control, motion control with sequenced drawing, and sequenced drawing using Ring Motion Control.
