TITLE: D / Errors / Fails only on Chip-RAM-Only Machines

D / Errors / Fails only on Chip-RAM-Only Machines ]" border=0> Caused by specifically asking for or requiring MEMF_FAST memory. If you don't need Chip RAM, ask for memory type 0L, or MEMF_CLEAR , or MEMF_PUBLIC |MEMF_CLEAR as applicable. If there is Fast memory available, you will be given Fast memory. If not, you will get Chip RAM. May also be caused by trackdisk-level loading of code or data over important system memory or structures which might reside in low Chip memory on a Chip-RAM-Only machine.
