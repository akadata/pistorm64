12 / / Using Boopsi / Disposing of an Object ]" border=0> When an application is done with an object it has to dispose of the object. To dispose of an object, use the Intuition function DisposeObject() : VOID DisposeObject(APTR boopsiobject); where boopsiobject is a pointer to the Boopsi object to be disposed. Note that some classes allow applications to connect child objects to a parent object so that when the application deletes the parent object, it automatically disposes of all of its children. Be careful not to dispose of an object that has already been disposed. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
