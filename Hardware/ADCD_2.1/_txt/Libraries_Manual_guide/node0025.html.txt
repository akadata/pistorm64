TITLE: 1 / / Design Decisions / ARexx

1 / / Design Decisions / ARexx ]" border=0> Add conditional ARexx capabilities to your program. ARexx is available on all Release 2 machines, and many 1.3 users have purchased ARexx separately. ARexx capability adds value to your product and allows users and vertical market developers to create custom and hybrid applications. Add the ability to control your application externally via ARexx, and internally via ARexx macros. Allow the user to execute ARexx scripts to control other programs, including the ability to pass information from your program to other applications. For more information on adding ARexx functionality to your application, see the Amiga Programmer's Guide to ARexx, a publication by Commodore Applications and Technical Support ( CATS ). Contact your local Amiga support organization for information on ordering this book. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
