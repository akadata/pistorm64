B Boopsi Class Reference / imageclass ]" border=0> Class: imageclass Superclass: rootclass Include File: imageclass.h > This class is the base class for Boopsi Images. These images are backwards compatible with the conventional Intuition Images. Every Boopsi image has an Intuition Image structure embedded in it so Intuition can access the Boopsi image as a conventional Image structure when necessary. Normally there are no direct instances of this class, only instances of subclasses of imageclass.
