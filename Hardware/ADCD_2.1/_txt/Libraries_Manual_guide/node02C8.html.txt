TITLE: 21 / Task Traps / Trap Instructions

21 / Task Traps / Trap Instructions ]" border=0> The TRAP instructions in the 68000 generate traps 32-47. Because many independent pieces of system code may desire to use these traps, the AllocTrap() and FreeTrap() functions are provided. These work in a fashion similar to that used by AllocSignal() and FreeSignal() , mentioned in the " Exec Signals " chapter. Allocating a trap is simply a bookkeeping job within a task. It does not affect how the system calls the trap handler; it helps coordinate who owns what traps. Exec does nothing to determine whether or not a task is prepared to handle a particular trap. It simply calls your code. It is up to your program to handle the trap. To allocate any trap, you can use the following code: if (-1 == (trap = AllocTrap(-1))) printf("all trap instructions are in use\n"); Or you can select a specific trap using this code: if (-1 == (trap = AllocTrap(3))) printf("trap #3 is in use\n"); To free a trap, you use the FreeTrap() function passing it the trap number to be freed.
