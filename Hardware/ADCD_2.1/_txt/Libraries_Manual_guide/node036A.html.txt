27 Graphics Primitives / User Copper Lists ]" border=0> The Copper coprocessor allows you to produce mid-screen changes in certain hardware registers in addition to changes that the system software already provides. For example, it is the Copper that allows the Amiga to split the viewing area into multiple draggable screens, each with its own independent set of colors. To create your own mid-screen effects on the system hardware registers, you provide "user Copper lists" that can be merged into the system Copper lists. In the ViewPort data structure there is a pointer named UCopIns. If this pointer value is non-NULL, it points to a user Copper list that you have dynamically allocated and initialized to contain your own special hardware-stuffing instructions. You allocate a user Copper list by an instruction sequence such as the following: struct UCopList *uCopList = NULL; /* Allocate memory for the Copper list. Make certain that the */ /* initial memory is cleared. */ uCopList = (struct UCopList *) AllocMem(sizeof(struct UCopList), MEMF_PUBLIC|MEMF_CLEAR); if (uCopList == NULL) return(FALSE); Note: ----- User Copper lists do not have to be in Chip RAM.
