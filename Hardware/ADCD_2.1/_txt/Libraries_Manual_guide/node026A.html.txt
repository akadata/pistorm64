15 / / The Kinds of GadTools Gadgets / Generic Gadgets ]" border=0> If the application requires a specialized gadget which does not fit into any of the defined GadTools kinds but would still like to use the GadTools gadget creation and deletion functions, it may create a GadTools generic gadget and use it any way it sees fit. In fact, all of the kinds of GadTools gadgets are created out of GadTools GENERIC_KIND gadgets. The gadget that gets created will heed almost all the information contained in the NewGadget structure supplied. If ng_GadgetText is supplied, the Gadget 's GadgetText will point to an IntuiText structure with the provided string and font. However, do not specify any of the PLACETEXT ng_Flags , as they are currently ignored by GENERIC_KIND gadgets. PLACETEXT flags may be supported by generic GadTools gadgets in the future. It is up to the program to set the Flags , Activation , GadgetRender , SelectRender , MutualExclude and SpecialInfo fields of the Gadget structure. The application must also set the GadgetType field, but be certain to preserve the bits set by CreateGadget() . For instance, to make a gadget boolean, use: gad->GadgetType |= GTYP_BOOLGADGET; and not gad->GadgetType = GTYP_BOOLGADGET; Using direct assignment, (the = operator), clears all other flags in the GadgetType field and the gadget may not be properly freed by FreeGadgets() .
