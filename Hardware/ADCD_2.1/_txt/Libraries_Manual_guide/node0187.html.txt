6 / / Menu Selection Messages / Multi-Selection of Menu Items ]" border=0> Each activation of the menu system generates only a single event. The user may select none, one or many items using any of the selection techniques described above; still, only one event is sent. The program finds out whether or not multiple items have been chosen by examining the field called NextSelect in the MenuItem structure. The selected items are chained together through this field. This list is only valid until the user next activates the menu system, as the items are chained together through the actual MenuItem structures used in the menu system. If the user reselects an item, the NextSelect field of that item will be overwritten. In processing the menu events, the application should first take the appropriate action for the item selected by the user, then check the NextSelect field. If the number there is equal to the constant MENUNULL , there is no next selection. However, if it is not equal to MENUNULL, the user has selected another option after this one. The program should process the next item as well, by checking its NextSelect field, until it finds a NextSelect equal to MENUNULL. The following code fragment shows the correct way to process a menu event: struct IntuiMessage *msg; struct Menu *menuStrip; UWORD menuNumber; struct MenuItem *item; menuNumber = msg->Code; while (menuNumber != MENUNULL) { item = ItemAddress(menuStrip, menuNumber); /* process this item */ menuNumber = item->NextSelect; } Intuition specifies which item or sub-item was selected in the IDCMP_MENUPICK event by using a shorthand code known as a menu number. Programs can locate the MenuItem structure that corresponds to a given menu number by using the ItemAddress() function. This function translates a menu number into a pointer to the MenuItem structure represented by the menu number. struct MenuItem *ItemAddress( struct Menu *menuStrip, unsigned long menuNumber ); This allows the application to gain access to the MenuItem structure and to correctly process multi-select events. Again, when the user performs multiple selection, the program will receive only one message of class IDCMP_MENUPICK . For the program to behave correctly, it must pay attention to the NextSelect field of the MenuItem, which will lead to the other menu selections. There may be some cases in an application's logical flow where the selection of a menu item voids any further menu processing. For instance, after processing a "quit" menu selection, the application will, in general, ignore all further menu selections. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
