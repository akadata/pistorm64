28 / Using Virtual Sprites / Getting the VSprite List In Order ]" border=0> When the system has displayed the last line of a VSprite, it is able to reassign the hardware sprite to another VSprite located at a lower position on the screen. The system allocates hardware sprites in the order in which it encounters the VSprites in the list. Therefore, the list of VSprites must be sorted before the system can assign the use of the hardware Sprites correctly. The function SortGList() must be used to get the GELs in the correct order before the system is asked to display them. This sorting step is essential! It should be done before calling DrawGList() , whenever a GEL has changed position. This function is called as follows: struct RastPort myRastPort = {0}; SortGList(&myRastPort); The only argument is a pointer to the RastPort structure containing the GelsInfo .
