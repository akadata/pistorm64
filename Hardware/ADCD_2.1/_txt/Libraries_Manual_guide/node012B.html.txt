TITLE: 4 / Other Window Functions / Changing Message Queue Limits

4 / Other Window Functions / Changing Message Queue Limits ]" border=0> Starting with V36, windows have limits on the number of mouse movement and repeat key messages that may be waiting at their IDCMP at any time. These queue limits prevent the accumulation of these messages, which may arrive at the IDCMP message port in large numbers. Once a queue limit is reached, further messages of that type will be discarded by Intuition. The application will never hear about the discarded messages; they are gone forever. (Note that only mouse move and key repeat messages are limited this way. Other types of messages will still be added to the port.) Messages of the limited type will arrive at the port again after the application has replied to one of the messages in the queue. The queue limits are independent of each other. Having reached the limit for one type of message does not prevent other types of messages (that have not yet reached their queuing limits) from being added to the IDCMP. Note that the queues apply only to the IDCMP and not to messages received directly via an input handler or from the console device. Order of event arrival is not a factor in the message count. Messages may be sequential or interspersed with other events--only the number of messages of the specific type waiting at the IDCMP matters. The WA_RptQueue tag allows setting an initial value for the repeat key backlog limit for the window. There is no function to change this value as of V37. The default value for WA_RptQueue is 3. The WA_MouseQueue tag allows setting an initial value for the mouse message backlog limit for the window. The default value for WA_MouseQueue is 5. The number may later be changed with a call to SetMouseQueue() : LONG SetMouseQueue( struct Window *window, unsigned long queueLength ); Note that real information may be lost if the queue fills and Intuition is forced to discard messages. See the chapter " Intuition Mouse and Keyboard " for more information. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
