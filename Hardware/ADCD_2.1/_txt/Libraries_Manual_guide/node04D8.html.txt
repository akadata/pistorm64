TITLE: B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_FRAMEBOX

B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_FRAMEBOX ]" border=0> This method applies to image classes that are used to put a frame centered around some other objects. This method asks a framing image what its dimensions should be if it had to frame some object or set of objects that fit into a rectangular bounds. For example, to draw an frameiclass image around a group of gadgets that fit into a specific rectangle, you first send the frameiclass object an IM_FRAMEBOX message describing the dimensions and position of that rectangle. The frame reports what its position and dimensions would have to be to surround those gadgets. Use these results to draw the frameiclass image. The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. IM_FRAMEBOX uses a custom message structure: struct impFrameBox { ULONG MethodID; /* IM_FRAMEBOX */ struct IBox *imp_ContentsBox; /* The object fills in this */ /* structure with the */ /* dimensions of a rectangle */ /* big enough to frame... */ struct IBox *imp_FrameBox; /* intuition.h >) describing the dimensions and position of the rectangle to frame. After the framing image determines the position and size it should be in order to properly frame imp_FrameBox, it stores the result in the imp_ContentsBox IBox. This method allows an application to use a framing image without having to worry about image specific details such as the thickness of the frame or centering the frame around the object. The imp_FrameFlags field is a bit field used to specify certain options for the IM_FRAMEBOX method. Currently, there is only one defined for it, FRAMEF_SPECIFY. If this bit is set, the imp_FrameBox contains a width and height that the frame image has to use as its width and height, even if the imp_FrameBox is smaller than imp_ContentsBox. The frame is free to adjust its position, but it is stuck with the imp_FrameBox dimensions. This allows an application to set the size of the frame image and still allow the frame image to position itself so it is centered on a rectangle. The imageclass dispatcher does not support this method. It returns zero. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
