32 / / RigidDiskBlock and Alternate Filesystems / LoadSegBlock ]" border=0> This is the current specification of the LoadSegBlock. The end of data occurs when lsb_Next is NULL ($FFFFFFFF), and the summed data is exhausted. lsb_ID == 'LSEG' lsb_SummedLongs size of this checksummed structure Note that this is not 64 like most of the other structures. This is the number of valid longs in this image, like bbb_SummedLongs . lsb_ChkSum block checksum (longword sum to zero) lsb_HostID SCSI Target ID of host This describes the initiator ID for the creator of these blocks. (see rdb_HostID discussion) lsb_Next block number of the next LoadSegBlock lsb_LoadData data for "loadseg" The data starts here and continues as long as indicated by lsb_SummedLongs-5: e.g. if lsb_SummedLongs is 128 (ie. for 512 byte blocks), 123 longs of data are valid here.
