TITLE: 36 Translator Library / Opening the Translator Library

36 Translator Library / Opening the Translator Library ]" border=0> To use the Translate() function, you must first open the translator library. Setting a global variable, TranslatorBase, to the value returned from the call to OpenLibrary() enables the Amiga linker to correctly locate the translator library: struct Library *TranslatorBase; TranslatorBase = OpenLibrary("translator.library",REVISION); if(TranslatorBase != NULL) { /* use translator here -- library open */ } LIBS: must contain translator.library. -------------------------------------- Since translator is a disk-based library, the call to OpenLibrary() will work only if the LIBS: directory contains translator.library.
