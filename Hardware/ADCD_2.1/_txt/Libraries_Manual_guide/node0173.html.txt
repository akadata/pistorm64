5 / / Custom String Editing / Actions with SGH_KEY ]" border=0> If SGA_USE is set in the SGWork structure Actions field when the hook returns, Intuition will use the values in the SGWork fields WorkBuffer , NumChars , BufferPos , and LongInt ; copying the WorkBuffer to the StringInfo Buffer . SGA_USE is set by Intuition prior to calling the hook, and must be cleared by the hook if the changes are to be ignored. If SGA_USE is cleared when the hook returns, the string gadget will be unchanged. If SGA_END is set when the hook returns, Intuition will deactivate the string gadget. In this case, Intuition will place the value found in SGWork structure Code field into the IntuiMessage.Code field of the IDCMP_GADGETUP message it sends to the application. If SGA_REUSE and SGA_END are set when the hook returns, Intuition will reuse the input event after it deactivates the gadget. Starting in V37, the hook may set SGA_PREVACTIVE or SGA_NEXTACTIVE with SGA_END . This tells Intuition to activate the next or previous gadget that has the GFLG_TABCYCLE flag set. If SGA_BEEP is set when the hook returns, Intuition will call DisplayBeep() . Use this if the user has typed in error, or buffer is full. Set SGA_REDISPLAY if the changes to the gadget warrant a gadget redisplay. Changes to the cursor position require redisplay. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
