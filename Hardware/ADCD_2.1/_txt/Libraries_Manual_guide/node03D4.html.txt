29 / About Amiga Fonts / System Fonts In Release 2 ]" border=0> Under Release 2 and later versions of the OS, the system has additional font sources at its disposal. If an application asks the diskfont.library to load a font of a size that has no corresponding bitmap on disk, the library can generate that size font. If diskfont.library can find a smaller or larger version of the font requested, it can scale that font's bitmap to the size needed. Of course, because the library is scaling a bitmap, the quality of the bitmap can degenerate in the scaling process. A more significant improvement to the diskfont.library is that contains AGFA's Intellifont® engine. As of Release 2.04 (V37) the diskfont.library can utilize AGFA Compugraphic font outlines. The Compugraphic fonts (CG fonts) are mathematical outlines that describe what the font's characters look like. The advantage of the outline fonts is that they can be scaled to any point size without the loss of resolution inherent in bitmap scaling. From the programmers point of view, no extra information is necessary for using the CG fonts, the diskfont.library takes care of all the scaling. Future releases of the OS may bring finer control over the font scaling engine which will allow an application to rotate and shear glyphs. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
