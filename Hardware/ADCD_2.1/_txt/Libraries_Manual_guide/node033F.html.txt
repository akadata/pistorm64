27 / / Monitors, Modes and Display Database / Accessing MonitorSpec ]" border=0> The OpenMonitor() function will locate and open the requested MonitorSpec . It is called with either the name of the monitor or a ModeID. mspc = struct MonitorSpec *OpenMonitor(STRPTR name, ULONG modeID) If the name argument is non-NULL, the MonitorSpec is chosen by name. If the name argument is NULL, the MonitorSpec is chosen by ModeID. If both the name and ModeID arguments are NULL, a pointer to the MonitorSpec for the default monitor is returned. OpenMonitor() returns either a pointer to a MonitorSpec structure, or NULL if the requested MonitorSpec could not be opened. The CloseMonitor() function relinquishes access to a MonitorSpec previously acquired with OpenMonitor(). To set up a View in Release 2, a ViewExtra structure must also be created and attached to it. The ViewExtra.Monitor field must be initialized to the address of a valid MonitorSpec structure before the View is displayed. Use OpenMonitor() to initialize the Monitor field.
