3 / Advanced Screen Programming / Dual-Playfield Screen Example ]" border=0> This example shows how to create a dual-playfield display. Note that this technique is only valid for screen modes which support dual-playfield, do not try to convert other modes. Setting up dual playfield mode in the OpenScreen() call is not the best method of obtaining a dual playfield viewport for a screen. It is better to open a standard screen, passing to Intuition (or letting Intuition create) only one of the playfield bitmaps (the front one). Next allocate and set up a second bitmap, its bitplanes, and a RasInfo structure installing these into the new screen's viewport. Update the viewport modes to include DUALPF and call MakeScreen() and RethinkDisplay() . This method, shown in the example below, keeps Intuition rendering (gadgets, menus, windows) in a single playfield. dualplayfield.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
