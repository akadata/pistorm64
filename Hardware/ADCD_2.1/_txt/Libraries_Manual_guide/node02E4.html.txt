23 / List Functions / More on the Use of Named Lists ]" border=0> To find multiple occurrences of nodes with identical names, the FindName() function is called multiple times. For example, if you want to find all the nodes with the name pointed to by name: VOID DisplayName(struct List *list,UBYTE *name) { struct Node *node; if (node = FindName(list,name)) while (node) { printf("Found %s at location %lx\n",node->ln_Name,node); node = FindName((struct List *)node,name); } else printf("No node with name %s found.\n",name); } Notice that the second search uses the node found by the first search. The FindName() function never compares the specified name with that of the starting node. It always begins the search with the successor of the starting point. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
