TITLE: 20 / Allocating Multiple Memory Blocks / Sample Code

20 / Allocating Multiple Memory Blocks / Sample Code ]" border=0> Here's an example of showing how to use the AllocEntry() with multiple blocks of memory. allocentry.c AllocEntry() returns a pointer to a new MemList of the same size as the MemList that you passed to it. For example, ROM code can provide a MemList containing the requirements of a task and create a RAM-resident copy of the list containing the addresses of the allocated entries. The pointer to the MemList is used as the argument for FreeEntry() to free the memory blocks. Assembly Does Not Have MemEntry . -------------------------------- The MemList structure used by assembly programmers is slightly different; it has only a label for the start of the MemEntry array. See the Exec AllocEntry() Autodoc for an example of using AllocEntry() from assembler. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
