TITLE: 27 / / / Run-Time Name Binding of Mode Information

27 / / / Run-Time Name Binding of Mode Information ]" border=0> It is useful to associate common names with the various display modes. The Release 2 graphics library includes a provision for binding a name to a display mode so that it will be available via a query. This will be useful in the implementation of a standard screen-format requester. Note however that no names are bound initially since the bound names will take up RAM at all times. Instead defaults are used. Bound names will override the defaults though, so that, until the screen-format requester is localized to a non-English language, the modes can be localized by binding foreign language names to them. Here is an example of how to query the run-time name binding of a given mode from a DisplayInfoHandle . #include check_name_bound( handle ) DisplayInfoHandle handle; { struct NameInfo query; /* fill the buffer with Mode dimension information */ if(GetDisplayInfoData(handle, (UBYTE *)&query,sizeof(query), DTAG_NAME,NULL))) { printf("%s", query.Name); } } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
