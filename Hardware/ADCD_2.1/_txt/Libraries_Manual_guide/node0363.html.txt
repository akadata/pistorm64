TITLE: 27 / / Data Move Operations / Scrolling a Sub-rectangle of a Raster

27 / / Data Move Operations / Scrolling a Sub-rectangle of a Raster ]" border=0> You can scroll a sub-rectangle of a raster in any direction--up, down, left, right, or diagonally. To perform a scroll, you use the ScrollRaster() routine and specify a dx and dy (delta-x, delta-y) by which the rectangle image should be moved relative to the (0,0) location. As a result of this operation, the data within the rectangle will become physically smaller by the size of delta-x and delta-y, and the area vacated by the data when it has been cropped and moved is filled with the background color (color in BgPen ). ScrollRaster() is affected by the Mask setting. Here is the syntax of the ScrollRaster() function: ScrollRaster(&rastPort, dx, dy, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax); The &rastPort argument is a pointer to a RastPort . The dx and dy arguments are the distances (positive, 0, or negative) to move the rectangle. The outer bounds of the sub-rectangle are defined by the xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax arguments. Here are some examples that scroll a sub-rectangle: /* scroll up 2 */ ScrollRaster(&rastPort, 0, 2, 10, 10, 50, 50); /* scroll right 1 */ ScrollRaster(&rastPort, -1, 0, 10, 10, 50, 50); When scrolling a Simple Refresh window (or other layered RastPort ), ScrollRaster() scrolls the appropriate existing damage region. Refer to the " Intuition Windows " chapter for an explanation of Simple Refresh windows and damage regions . When scrolling a SuperBitMap window ScrollRaster() requires a properly initialized TmpRas. The TmpRas must be initialized to the size of one bitplane with a width and height the same as the SuperBitMap, using the technique described in the " Area-Fill Information " section above. If you are using a SuperBitMap Layer , it is possible that the information in the BitMap is not fully reflected in the layer and vice-versa. Two graphics calls, CopySBitMap() and SyncSBitMap() , remedy these situations. Again, refer to the " Intuition Windows " chapter for more on this. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
