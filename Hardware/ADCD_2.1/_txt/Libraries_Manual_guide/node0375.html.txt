28 / / Types Of GELs / AnimObs ]" border=0> The AnimOb (Animation Object) is a data structure that is used to group one or more AnimComps for convenient movement. For example, an AnimOb could be created that consists of two AnimComps, one that looks like a planet and another containing a sequence that describes orbiting moons. By moving just the AnimOb the image of the planet can be moved across the display and the moons will travel along with it, orbiting the planet the entire time. The system automatically manages the movement of all the AnimComps associated with the AnimOb. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
