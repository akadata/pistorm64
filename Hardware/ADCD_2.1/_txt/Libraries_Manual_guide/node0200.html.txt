12 Boopsi--Object Oriented Intuition / OOP Overview ]" border=0> Understanding Boopsi requires an understanding of several of the concepts behind Object Oriented Programming. This section is a general overview of these concepts as they pertain to Boopsi. Because Boopsi is in part based on the concepts present in the OOP language Smalltalk, a reference book on Smalltalk may provide a deeper understanding of Boopsi in general. Timothy Budd's book entitled A Little Smalltalk (Addison-Wesley Publishing ISBN 0-201-10698-1) is a good start. In the Boopsi version of the Object Oriented Programming model, everything is an Object. For example, a proportional gadget named myprop is an object. Certain objects have similar characteristics and can be classified into groups called classes. As objects, Rover the dog, Bob the cat, and Sam the bird are all distinct objects but they all have something in common, they can all be classified as animals. As objects, myprop the proportional gadget, mystring the string gadget, and mybutton the button gadget all have something in common, they can all be classified as gadgets. A specific object is an instance of a particular class ("Rover" is an instance of class "animal", "myslidergadget" is an instance of class "gadget"). Notice that, although Rover, Bob, and Sam can all be classified as animals, each belongs to a subgroup of the animal class. "Rover" is an instance of class "dog", "Bob" is an instance of class "cat", and "Sam" is an instance of class "bird". Because each of these animal types share common characteristics, each type makes up its own class. Because dog, cat, and bird are subclassifications of the animal class, they are known as subclasses of the animal class. Conversely, the animal class is the superclass of the dog, cat, and bird classes. Following the branches upward from class to superclass will bring you to a universal root category from which all objects are derived. The OOP language Smalltalk calls this class "Object". Figure 12-1: Object Diagram object | ___________|__________ / \ / \ animal vegetables | | _____|_____ _____|_____ / | \ / | \ / | \ / | \ dog cat mouse peas corn spinach Like Smalltalk, Boopsi also has a universal root catagory, rootclass . Currently, Intuition defines three immediate subclasses of rootclass. The first, gadgetclass , is the class of Boopsi gadgets. The second class, imageclass , makes up the class of Boopsi images. Unlike gadgetclass and imageclass , the remaining subclass, icclass , does not correspond to an existing Intuition entity, it is a concept new to Intuition. Icclass, or interconnection class, allows one Boopsi object to notify another Boopsi object when a specific event occurs. For example, consider a Boopsi proportional gadget and a Boopsi image object that displays an integer value. An application can connect these two objects so that the prop gadget tells the image object the prop gadget's current value, which the image object displays. Every time the user slides the prop gadget, the prop gadget notifies the image of the change and the image updates its display to reflect the prop gadget's current integer value. Because these objects are talking to each other rather than the application, the updates happen automatically. The application doesn't have to talk to the two objects, it only has to connect them. Figure 12-2: Simple Boopsi Diagram An object's characteristics and behavior are determined by its class. Each class can define a set of attributes and a set of methods that apply to all objects of that class. An attribute is a variable characteristic of an object. For example, an attribute for the animal class could be the number of legs an animal object has. An example of a Boopsi attribute is the X coordinate of a Boopsi image object. The data that makes up the values of an object's attributes is collectively known as the instance data for that object. The behavior of an object depends upon the set of methods associated to it by its class. A method is basically a function that applies to objects of that class. An example of a Boopsi method is the imageclass method IM_DRAW . This method tells a Boopsi image to draw itself. All Boopsi actions are carried out via methods. From the Object Diagram, two of the methods of the "animal" class could be "eat" and "sleep". One of the methods of the "dog" class could be "bark". Notice that instances of the "dog" class can do more than just bark, they can also eat and sleep. This is because a subclass inherits methods from its superclasses. If there were a subclass of dog called "attack dog", all instances of that class would be able to bark, eat, and sleep, as well as "attack". Due to inheritance, a subclass has all of the methods and all of the attributes of its superclass. For example, the IA_Height attribute is defined by imageclass . All instances of the subclasses of imageclass have their own IA_Height attribute, even though the subclasses do not explicitly define IA_Height. In turn, all instances of subclasses of the imageclass subclasses also inherit the IA_Height attribute. All classes on levels below a class will inherit its methods and attributes. When an application or a Boopsi object wants another Boopsi object to perform a method, it passes it a command in the form of a Boopsi message. A Boopsi message tells an object which method to perform. The message may also contain some parameters that the method requires. Watch Out! ---------- The term "message" used in object oriented terminology can be little confusing to the Amiga programmer because the Boopsi message has nothing to do with an Exec message. Boopsi classes can be either public or private. Public classes have ASCII names associated with them and are accessible to all applications. Private classes have no ASCII name and normally can only be accessed by the application that created the private class.
