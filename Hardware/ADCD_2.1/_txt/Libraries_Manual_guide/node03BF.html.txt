28 / / Specifying Animation Components / Sequencing AnimComps ]" border=0> To specify the sequencing of AnimComp images, the pointers called PrevSeq and NextSeq are used to build a doubly-linked list. The sequence can be made circular (and usually is) by linking the first and last AnimComps in the sequence: the NextSeq of the last AnimComp must point back to the first AnimComp, and the PrevSeq of the first AnimComp must point to the last AnimComp. If the list is a loop, then the system will continue to cycle through the list until it is stopped. If the list is not a loop, then the program must act to restart the sequence after the last item is displayed. The AnimCRoutine field of the last AnimComp can be used to do this.
