TITLE: 8 / Creating Text / IntuiText Structure

8 / Creating Text / IntuiText Structure ]" border=0> To render text using Intuition, the application must create one or more instances of the IntuiText structure: struct IntuiText { UBYTE FrontPen, BackPen; UBYTE DrawMode; WORD LeftEdge; WORD TopEdge; struct TextAttr *ITextFont; UBYTE *IText; struct IntuiText *NextText; }; Here is a brief description of each member of the IntuiText structure: FrontPen The pen number specifying the color used to draw the text. BackPen The pen number specifying the color used to draw the background for the text, if JAM2 drawing mode is specified. DrawMode This field specifies one of four drawing modes: JAM1 FrontPen is used to draw the text; background color is unchanged. JAM2 FrontPen is used to draw the text; background color is changed to the color in BackPen. COMPLEMENT The characters are drawn in the complement of the colors that were in the background. INVERSVID Inverses the draw modes describe above. For instance INVERVID used with JAM1 means the character is untouched while the background is filled with the color of the FrontPen. LeftEdge and TopEdge The location of the text relative to its base position when it is drawn. These offsets are added to the base position to determine the final location of the text data. The base position for text rendered with PrintIText() is taken from arguments passed in the function call. For gadgets and menus, the base position is always the upper, left corner of the select box. For requesters the base position is always the upper, left corner of the requester. LeftEdge gives the offset of the left edge of the character cell and TopEdge gives the offset of the top edge of the character cell for the first character in the text string. Negative values of LeftEdge and TopEdge move the position up and to the left of the base position. Positive values move down and to the right. ITextFont A pointer to a TextAttr structure defining the font to be used. Set this to NULL to use the default font. IText A pointer to the NULL terminated text string to be displayed. NextText A pointer to another instance of IntuiText. Set this field to NULL for the last IntuiText in a list. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
