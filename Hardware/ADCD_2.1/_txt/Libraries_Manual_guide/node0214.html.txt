TITLE: 12 / / Writing The Dispatcher / OM_GET

12 / / Writing The Dispatcher / OM_GET ]" border=0> The rkmmodel only has one "gettable" attribute: RKMMOD_CurrVal , which makes processing it easy. The OM_GET message looks like this (defined in classusr.h >): struct opGet { ULONG MethodID; /* OM_GET */ ULONG opg_AttrID; /* The attribute to retrieve */ ULONG *opg_Storage; /* a place to put the attribute's value */ }; When the rkmmodelclass dispatcher receives an OM_GET message with an opg_AttrID equal to RKMMOD_CurrVal , it copies the current value ( RKMModData ).currval to the memory location opg_Storage points to and returns a value of TRUE. The TRUE indicates that there was no error. If opg_AttrID is not RKMMOD_CurrVal, the dispatcher should let its superclass handle this message. The rkmmodelclass dispatcher can take advantage of the fact that the only "gettable" attribute available to an rkmmodel is RKMMOD_CurrVal (the attributes defined by modelclass and icclass are not gettable--see the Boopsi Class Reference in the Appendix B of this manual for more details on which attributes are "settable", "gettable", etc.). If opg_AttrID is not RKMMOD_CurrVal, the rkmmodelclass dispatcher can return FALSE, indicating that the attribute was not "gettable". If the rkmmodelclass dispatcher comes across any other messages besides OM_NEW , OM_SET , OM_UPDATE , and OM_GET message, it blindly passes them on to its superclass for processing.
