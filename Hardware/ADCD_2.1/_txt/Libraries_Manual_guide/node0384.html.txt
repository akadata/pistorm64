28 / Using Virtual Sprites / VSprite Position ]" border=0> To control the position of a VSprite, the x and y variables in the VSprite structure are used. These specify where the upper left corner of the VSprite will be, relative to the upper left corner of the playfield area it appears over. So if VSprites are used under Intuition and within a screen, they will be positioned relative to the upper left-hand corner of the screen. In a 320 by 200 screen, a y value of 0 puts the VSprite at the top of that display, a y value of (200 - VSprite height) puts the VSprite at the bottom. And an x value of 0 puts the VSprite at the left edge of that display, while an x value of (320 - VSprite width) puts the VSprite at the far right. Values of less than (0,0) or greater than (320, 200) may be used to move the VSprite partially or entirely off the screen, if desired. See the " Graphics Primitives " chapter for more information on display coordinates and display size. See the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual for more information on hardware sprites. Position VSprites Properly. --------------------------- It is important that the starting position of true VSprites is not less than -20 in the y direction, which is the start of the active display area for sprites. Also, if they are moved too far to the left, true VSprites may not have enough DMA time to be displayed. The x, y values may be set like this to put the VSprite in the upper-left: myVSprite.Y = 0; myVSprite.X = 0; [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
