28 / / Detecting Gel Collisions / VSprite BorderLine ]" border=0> For faster collision detection, the system uses the BorderLine member of the VSprite structure. BorderLine specifies the location of the horizontal logical-OR combination of all of the bits of the object. It may be compared to taking the whole object's shadow/collision mask and squishing it down into a single horizontal line. You provide the system with a place to store this line. The size of the data area you allocate must be at least as large as the image width. In other words, if it takes three 16-bit words to hold one line of a GEL, then you must reserve three words for the BorderLine . In the VSprite examples, the routine makeVSprite() correctly allocates and initializes the collision mask and borderline. For example: WORD myBorderLineData[3]; /* reserve space for BorderLine */ /* for this Bob */ myVSprite.BorderLine = myBorderLineData; /* tell the system */ /* where it is */ Here is a sample of an object and its BorderLine image: 011000001100 Object 001100011000 001100011000 000110110000 000010100000 011110111100 BorderLine image Using this squished image, the system can quickly determine if the image is touching the left or rightmost boundary of the drawing area. To establish default BorderLine and CollMask data, call the InitMasks() function. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
