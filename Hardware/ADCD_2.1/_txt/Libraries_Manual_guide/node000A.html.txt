1 / Programming in the Amiga Environment / Multitasking ]" border=0> The key feature of the Amiga's operating system design is multitasking . Multitasking means many programs, or tasks, reside in memory at the same time sharing system resources with one another. Programs take turns running so it appears that many programs are running simultaneously. Multitasking is based on the concept that a program spends most of its time waiting for things to happen. A program waits for events like key presses, mouse movement, or disk activity. While a program is waiting, the CPU is idle. The CPU could be used to run a different program during this idle period if there was a convenient method for rapidly switching from one program to another. This is what multitasking does.
