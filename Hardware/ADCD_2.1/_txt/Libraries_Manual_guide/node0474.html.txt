34 / / Details Of the Keymap Structure / Capsable Bit Tables ]" border=0> The vectors km_LoCapsable and km_HiCapsable each point to an array of 8 bytes that contain more information about the keytable entries. Specifically, if the Caps Lock key has been pressed (the Caps Lock LED is on) and if there is a bit on in that position in the capsable map, then this key will be treated as though the Shift key is now currently pressed. For example, in the default key mapping, the alphabetic keys are "capsable" but the punctuation keys are not. This allows you to set the Caps Lock key, just as on a normal typewriter, and get all capital letters. However, unlike a normal typewriter, you need not go out of Caps Lock to correctly type the punctuation symbols or numeric keys. In the byte array, the bits that control this feature are numbered from the lowest bit in the byte, and from the lowest memory byte address to the highest. For example, the bit representing capsable status for the key that transmits raw code 00 is bit 0 in byte 0; for the key that transmits raw code 08 it is bit 0 in byte 1, and so on. There are 64 bits (8 bytes) in each of the two capsable tables. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
