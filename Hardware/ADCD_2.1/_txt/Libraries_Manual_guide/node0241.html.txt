14 / / Icon Library Data Structures / The DiskObject Structure ]" border=0> The actual data present in the .info file is organized as a DiskObject structure which is defined in the include file workbench.h >. For a complete listing, see the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs. The DiskObject structure contains the following elements: struct DiskObject { UWORD do_Magic; /* magic number at start of file */ UWORD do_Version; /* so we can change structure */ struct Gadget do_Gadget; /* a copy of in core gadget */ UBYTE do_Type; char *do_DefaultTool; char **do_ToolTypes; LONG do_CurrentX; LONG do_CurrentY; struct DrawerData *do_DrawerData; char *do_ToolWindow; /* only applies to tools */ LONG do_StackSize; /* only applies to tools */ }; do_Magic A magic number that the icon library looks for to make sure that the file it is reading really contains an icon. It should be the manifest constant WB_DISKMAGIC. PutDiskObject() will put this value in the structure, and GetDiskObject() will not believe that a file is really an icon unless this value is correct. do_Version This provides a way to enhance the .info file in an upwardly-compatible way. It should be WB_DISKVERSION. The icon library will set this value for you and will not believe weird values. do_Gadget This contains all the imagery for the icon. See the " Gadget Structure " section below for more details. do_Type The type of the icon; can be set to any of the following values. WBDISK The root of a disk WBDRAWER A directory on the disk WBTOOL An executable program WBPROJECT A data file WBGARBAGE The Trashcan directory WBKICK A Kickstart disk WBAPPICON Any object not directly associated with a filing system object, such as a print spooler (new in Release 2). Table 14-2: Workbench Object Types do_DefaultTool Default tools are used for project and disk icons. For projects (data files), the default tool is the program Workbench runs when the project is activated. Any valid AmigaDOS path may be entered in this field such as "SYS:myprogram", "df0:mypaint", "myeditor" or ":work/mytool". For disk icons, the default tool is the diskcopy program ("SYS:System/DiskCopy") that will be used when this disk is the source of a copy. do_ToolTypes This is an array of free-format strings. Workbench does not enforce any rules on these strings, but they are useful for passing environment information. See the section on " The Tool Types Array " below for more information. do_CurrentX, do_CurrentY Drawers have a virtual coordinate system. The user can scroll around in this system using the scroll gadgets on the window that opens when the drawer is activated. Each icon in the drawer has a position in the coordinate system. CurrentX and CurrentY contain the icon's current position in the drawer. Picking a position for a newly created icon can be tricky. NO_ICON_POSITION is a system constant for do_CurrentX and do_CurrentY that instructs Workbench to pick a reasonable place for the icon. Workbench will place the icon in an unused region of the drawer. If there is no space in the drawers window, the icon will be placed just to the right of the visible region. do_DrawerData If the icon is associated with a directory (WBDISK, WBDRAWER, WBGARBAGE), it needs a DrawerData structure to go with it. This structure contains an Intuition NewWindow structure (see the " Intuition Windows " chapter for more information): struct DrawerData { struct NewWindow dd_NewWindow; /* structure to open window */ LONG dd_CurrentX; /* current x coordinate of */ /* origin */ LONG dd_CurrentY; /* current y coordinate of */ /* origin */ }; Workbench uses this to hold the current window position and size of the window so it will reopen in the same place. do_ToolWindow This field is reserved for future use. do_StackSize This is the size of the stack (in bytes) used for running the tool. If this is NULL, then Workbench will use a reasonable default stack size (currently 4K bytes). Stack Size is Taken from the Project Icon. ----------------------------------------- When a tool is run via the default tool mechanism (i.e., a project was activated, not the tool itself), Workbench uses the stack size specified in the project's .info file and the tool's .info file is ignored.
