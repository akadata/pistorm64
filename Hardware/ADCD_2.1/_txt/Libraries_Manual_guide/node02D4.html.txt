TITLE: 22 / The Signal System / Waiting for a Signal

22 / The Signal System / Waiting for a Signal ]" border=0> Signals are most often used to wake up a task upon the occurrence of some external event. Applications call the Exec Wait() function, directly or indirectly, in order to enter a wait state until some external event triggers a signal which awakens the task. Though signals are usually not used to interrupt an executing task, they can be used this way. Task exceptions, described in the " Exec Tasks " chapter, allow signals to act as a task-local interrupt. The Wait() function specifies the set of signals that will wake up the task and then puts the task to sleep (into the waiting state). ULONG Wait( ULONG signalSet ); Any one signal or any combination of signals from this set are sufficient to awaken the task. Wait() returns a mask indicating which signals satisfied the Wait() call. Note that when signals are used in conjunction with a message port, a set signal bit does not necessarily mean that there is a message at the message port. See the " Exec Messages and Ports " chapter for details about proper handling of messages. Because tasks (and interrupts) normally execute asynchronously, it is often possible to receive a particular signal before a task actually Wait()s for it. In such cases the Wait() will be immediately satisfied, and the task will not be put to sleep. The Wait() function implicitly clears those signal bits that satisfied the wait condition. This effectively resets those signals for reuse. However, keep in mind that a task might get more signals while it is still processing the previous signal. If the same signal is received multiple times and the signal bit is not cleared between them, some signals will go unnoticed. Be aware that using Wait() will break a Forbid() or Disable() state. Wait() cannot be used in supervisor mode or within interrupts. A task may Wait() for a combination of signal bits and will wake up when any of the signals occur. Wait() returns a signal mask specifying which signal or signals were received. Usually the program must check the returned mask for each signal it was waiting on and take the appropriate action for each that occurred. The order in which these bits are checked is often important. Here is a hypothetical example of a process that is using the console and timer devices, and is waiting for a message from either device and a possible break character issued by the user: consoleSignal = 1L mp_SigBit; timerSignal = 1L mp_SigBit; userSignal = SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C; /* Defined in */ signals = Wait(consoleSignal | timerSignal | userSignal); if (signals & consoleSignal) printf("new character\n"); if (signals & timeOutSignal) printf("timeout\n"); if (signals & userSignal) printf("User Ctrl-C Abort\n"); This code will put the task to sleep waiting for a new character, or the expiration of a time period, or a Ctrl-C break character issued by the user. Notice that this code checks for an incoming character signal before checking for a timeout. Although a program can check for the occurrence of a particular event by checking whether its signal has occurred, this may lead to busy wait polling. Such polling is wasteful of the processor and is usually harmful to the proper function of the Amiga system. However, if a program needs to do constant processing and also check signals (a compiler for example) SetSignal (0,0) can be used to get a copy of your task's current signals. ULONG SetSignal( ULONG newSignals, ULONG signalSet ); SetSignal() can also be used to set or clear the state of the signals. Implementing this can be dangerous and should generally not be done. The following fragment illustrates a possible use of SetSignal(). signals = SetSignal(0,0); /* Get current state of signals */ if (signals & SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C) /* Check for Ctrl-C. */ { printf("Break\n"); /* Ctrl-C signal has been set. */ SetSignal(0, SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C) /* Clear Ctrl-C signal. */ } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
