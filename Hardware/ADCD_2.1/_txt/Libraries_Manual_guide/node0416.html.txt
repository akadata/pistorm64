TITLE: 32 Expansion Library / The Expansion Sequence

32 Expansion Library / The Expansion Sequence ]" border=0> During system initialization, expansion.library configures each expansion peripheral in turn by examining its identification information and assigning it an appropriate address space. If the board is a RAM board, it can be added to the system memory list to make the RAM available for allocation by system tasks. Descriptions of all configured boards are kept in a private ExpansionBase list of ConfigDev structures. A board's identification information is stored in the ExpansionRom sub-structure contained within the ConfigDev structure. Applications can examine individual or all ConfigDev structures with the expansion.library function FindConfigDev() . The ConfigDev structure is defined in configvars.h > and .i >: struct ConfigDev { struct Node cd_Node; UBYTE cd_Flags; /* (read/write) */ UBYTE cd_Pad; /* reserved */ struct ExpansionRom cd_Rom; /* copy of board's expansion ROM */ APTR cd_BoardAddr; /* memory where board was placed */ ULONG cd_BoardSize; /* size of board in bytes */ UWORD cd_SlotAddr; /* which slot number (PRIVATE) */ UWORD cd_SlotSize; /* number of slots (PRIVATE) */ APTR cd_Driver; /* pointer to node of driver */ struct ConfigDev *cd_NextCD; /* linked list of drivers to config */ ULONG cd_Unused[4]; /* for whatever the driver wants */ }; /* cd_Flags */ #define CDB_SHUTUP 0 /* this board has been shut up */ #define CDB_CONFIGME 1 /* this board needs a driver to claim it */ #define CDF_SHUTUP 0x01 #define CDF_CONFIGME 0x02 The ExpansionRom structure within ConfigDev contains the board identification information that is read from the board's PAL or ROM at expansion time. The actual onboard identification information of a Zorro II board appears in the high nibbles of the first $40 words at the start of the board. Except for the first nibble pair ($00/$02) which when combined form er_Type, the information is stored in inverted ("ones-complement") format where binary 1's are represented as 0's and 0's are represented as 1's. The expansion.library reads the nibbles of expansion information from the board, un-inverts them (except for $00/$02 er_Type which is already un-inverted), and combines them to form the elements of the ExpansionRom structure. The ExpansionRom structure is defined in configregs.h > and .i >: struct ExpansionRom { /* First 16 bytes of the expansion ROM */ UBYTE er_Type; /* Board type, size and flags */ UBYTE er_Product; /* Product number, assigned by manufacturer */ UBYTE er_Flags; /* Flags */ UBYTE er_Reserved03; /* Must be zero ($ff inverted) */ UWORD er_Manufacturer; /* Unique ID,ASSIGNED BY AMIGA, INC.! */ ULONG er_SerialNumber; /* Available for use by manufacturer */ UWORD er_InitDiagVec; /* Offset to optional "DiagArea" structure */ UBYTE er_Reserved0c; UBYTE er_Reserved0d; UBYTE er_Reserved0e; UBYTE er_Reserved0f; }; Simple Expansion Library Example [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
