12 / / The Active Gadget / RKMButtonclass.c ]" border=0> The following example is a sample Boopsi gadget, RKMButClass.c. While the user has the RKMButton selected, the gadget sends an OM_UPDATE message to its ICA_TARGET for every timer event the button sees. The gadget sends notification about its RKMBUT_Pulse attribute, which is the horizontal distance in screen pixels the mouse is from the center of the button. The gadget takes care of rendering all of its imagery (as opposed to using a Boopsi image to do it). The gadget's imagery is scalable to any dimensions and can be set (using SetGadgetAttrs() ) while the gadget is in place. One possible use for such a gadget is as buttons for a prop gadget. If the user has the prop gadget's RKMButton selected, while the mouse is to the left of the button's center, the knob on the prop gadget moves left. While the mouse is to the right of the button's center, the knob on the prop gadget moves right. The speed at which the knob moves is proportional to the horizontal distance from the mouse to the active RKMButton. RKMButClass.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
