5 Intuition Gadgets / About Gadgets ]" border=0> There are two kinds of gadgets: system gadgets and application gadgets. System gadgets are set up by Intuition to handle the positioning and depth arranging of screens, and to handle the positioning, sizing, closing and depth arranging of windows. System gadgets always use the same imagery and location giving the windows and screens of any application a basic set of controls that are familiar and easy to operate. In general, applications do not have to do any processing for system gadgets; Intuition does all the work. Application gadgets are set up by an application program. These may be the basic gadget types described in this chapter, the pre-fabricated gadgets supplied by the GadTools library, or special gadget types defined through Intuition's custom gadget and BOOPSI facilities. Application gadgets can be placed anywhere within a window and can use just about any image. The action associated with an application gadget is carried out by the application. There are four basic types of application gadgets: * Boolean (or button) gadgets elicit true/false or yes/no kinds of answers from the user. * Proportional gadgets allow the user to select from a continuous range of options, such as volume or speed. * String gadgets are used to get or display character based information (a special class of string gadget allows entry of numeric data.) * Custom gadgets, a new, generalized form of gadget, provide flexibility to perform any type of function. The way a gadget is used varies according to the type of gadget. For a boolean gadget, the user operates the gadget by simply clicking the mouse select button. For a string gadget, a cursor appears, allowing the user to enter data from the keyboard. For a proportional gadget, the user can either drag the knob with the mouse or click in the gadget container to move the knob by a set increment. Gadgets are chosen by positioning the pointer within an area called the select box, which is application defined, and pressing the mouse select button (left mouse button). When a gadget is selected, its imagery is changed to indicate that it is activated. The highlighting method for the gadget may be set by the application. Highlighting methods include alternate image, alternate border, a box around the gadget and color complementing. Figure 5-1: System and Application Gadgets A gadget can be either enabled or disabled. Disabled gadgets cannot be operated and are indicated by ghosting the gadget, that is, overlaying its image with a pattern of dots. Gadgets may also be directly modified and redrawn by first removing the gadget from the system. System Gadgets Adding and Removing Gadgets Application Gadgets [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
