TITLE: 8 / Creating Text / Linking Text Strings

8 / Creating Text / Linking Text Strings ]" border=0> The NextText field can point to another instance of an IntuiText structure. This allows the application to create a complex object which has several distinct groups of characters, each with its own color, font, location, and drawing mode. This can be used to create multiple lines of text, to position characters in the text very accurately and to change the color or font of the text. Each list of IntuiText objects may be drawn with one call to PrintIText() , or attached to a gadget, menu or requester as a single object. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
