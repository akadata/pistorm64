TITLE: 35 Math Libraries / FFP Mathematics Conversion Library

35 Math Libraries / FFP Mathematics Conversion Library ]" border=0> The FFP mathematics conversion library provides functions to convert ASCII strings to their FFP equivalents and vice versa. It is accessed by linking code into the executable file being created. The name of the file to include in the library description of the link command line is amiga.lib. When this is included, direct calls are made to the conversion functions. Only a C interface exists for the conversion functions; there is no assembly language interface. The basic math library is required in order to access these functions. #include #include #include struct Library *MathBase; VOID main() { if (MathBase = OpenLibrary("mathffp.library", 33)) { . . . CloseLibrary(MathBase); } else printf("Can't open mathffp.library\n"); } Math Support Functions [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
