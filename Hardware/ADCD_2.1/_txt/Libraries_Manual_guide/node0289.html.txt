TITLE: 17 Introduction to Exec / Signals

17 Introduction to Exec / Signals ]" border=0> The Amiga uses a mechanism called signals to tell a task that some event occurred. Each task has its own set of 32 signals, 16 of which are set aside for system use. When one task signals a second task, it asks the OS to set a specific bit in the 32-bit long word set aside for the second task's signals. Signals are what makes it possible for a task to go to sleep. When a task goes to sleep, it asks the OS to wake it up when a specific signal bit gets set. That bit is tied to some event. When that event occurs, that signal bit gets set. This triggers the OS into waking up the sleeping task. To go to sleep, a task calls a system function called Wait() . This function takes one argument, a bitmask that tells Exec which of the task's signal bits to "listen to". The task will only wake up if it receives one of the signals whose corresponding bit is set in that bitmask. For example, if a task wanted to wait for signals 17 and 19, it would call Wait() like this: mysignals = Wait(1L Wait() puts the task to sleep and will not return until some other task sets at least one of these two signals. When the task wakes up, mysignals will contain the bitmask of the signal or signals that woke up the task. It is possible for several signals to occur simultaneously, so any combination of the signals that the task Wait()ed on can occur. It is up to the waking task to use the return value from Wait() to figure out which signal or signals occurred.
