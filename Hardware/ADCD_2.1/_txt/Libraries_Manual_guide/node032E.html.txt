27 / / Forming a Basic Display / Preparing the BitMap Structure ]" border=0> The BitMap structure tells the system where to find the display and drawing memory and how this memory space is organized. The following code section prepares a BitMap structure, including allocation of memory for the bitmap. This is done with two functions, InitBitMap() and AllocRaster() . InitBitMap() takes four arguments--a pointer to a BitMap and the depth, width, and height of the desired bitmap. Once the bitmap is initialized, memory for its bitplanes must be allocated. AllocRaster() takes two arguments--width and height. Here is a code section to initialize a bitmap: /* Init BitMap for RasInfo. */ InitBitMap(&bitMap, DEPTH, WIDTH, HEIGHT); /* Set the plane pointers to NULL so the cleanup routine will know */ /* if they were used. */ for(depth=0; depth [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
