TITLE: 10 / / Intuition's Use of Mouse Events / Select Button

10 / / Intuition's Use of Mouse Events / Select Button ]" border=0> When the user presses the left, or select button, Intuition examines the state of the system and the position of the pointer. This information is used to decide whether or not the user is trying to select some object, operation, or option. For example, the user positions the pointer over a gadget and then presses the left button to select that gadget. Alternatively, the user can position the pointer over a window and press the select button to activate the window. The pointer is said to be over an object when the pointer's hot spot is positioned within the selection region of the object. A number of other common techniques involving the select button are available. They include: Drag Select Multiple objects or an extended area may be selected by dragging the mouse over a range with the select button held down. For instance, in Release 2, multiple icons can be selected in a Workbench window by pressing the select button while the pointer is over the background of the window (not an icon or a system gadget) and then moving the mouse with the select button held down. A selection rectangle will be displayed and all icons within the rectangle will be selected. Similarly, the user may highlight blocks of text in a console window by pressing the select button over the first desired character and dragging the mouse to the last desired character while holding the button down. Multi-Select or Shift Select Another way to select multiple objects or an extended area is through the shift select technique. First, select the first member of the group of objects in the normal way. Additional objects can be added to the group by holding down the Shift key while the select button is pressed. This technique works with Workbench icons, where icons may be added one-at-a-time to the list of selected icons; and with text in a console window, where the selected text is extended to include the new position. Note that text need not operate this way, and the application may allow multiple discrete blocks to be selected at any given time. Cancel Drag Operation Both drag select and the dragging of individual objects may often be canceled by pressing the right mouse button before completing the drag operation (before releasing the select button). Examples of this include window dragging and sizing, and positioning of Workbench icons. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
