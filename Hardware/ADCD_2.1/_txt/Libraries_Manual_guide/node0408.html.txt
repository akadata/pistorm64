TITLE: 31 Commodities Exchange Library / Connecting CxObjects

31 Commodities Exchange Library / Connecting CxObjects ]" border=0> A CxObject has to be inserted into the Commodities network before it can process any CxMessages . AttachCxObj() adds a CxObject to the personal list of another CxObject. The HotKey.c example uses it to attach its filter to a broker . void AttachCxObj ( CxObj *headobj, CxObj *co); void InsertCxObj ( CxObj *headobj, CxObj *co, CxObj *co_pred ); void EnqueueCxObj( CxObj *headobj, CxObj *co ); void SetCxObjPri ( CxObj *co, long pri ); void RemoveCxObj ( CxObj *co ); AttachCxObj() adds the CxObject to the end of headobj's personal list. The ordering of a CxObject list determines which object gets CxMessages first. InsertCxObj() also inserts a CxObject, but it inserts it after another CxObject already in the personal list (co_pred in the prototype above). Brokers aren't the only CxObjects with a priority. All CxObjects have a priority associated with them. To change the priority of any CxObject, use the SetCxObjPri() function. A commodity can use the priority to keep CxObjects in a personal list sorted by their priority. The commodities.library function EnqueueCxObj() inserts a CxObject into another CxObject's personal list based on priority. Like its name implies, the RemoveCxObj() function removes a CxObject from a personal list. Note that it is not necessary to remove a CxObject from a list in order to delete it.
