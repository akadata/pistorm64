TITLE: 27 / / / Drawing Multiple Lines with a Single Command

27 / / / Drawing Multiple Lines with a Single Command ]" border=0> You can use multiple Draw() statements to draw connected line figures. If the shapes are all definable as interconnected, continuous lines, you can use a simpler function, called PolyDraw() . PolyDraw() takes a set of line endpoints and draws a shape using these points. You call PolyDraw() with the statement: PolyDraw(&rastPort, count, arraypointer); PolyDraw() reads the array of points and draws a line from the first pair of coordinates to the second, then a connecting line to each succeeding pair in the array until count points have been connected. This function uses the current drawing mode, pens, line pattern, and write mask specified in the target RastPort ; for example, this fragment draws a rectangle, using the five defined pairs of x,y coordinates. SHORT linearray[] = { 3, 3, 15, 3, 15,15, 3,15, 3, 3 }; PolyDraw(&rastPort, 5, linearray); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
