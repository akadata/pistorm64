TITLE: 16 ASL Library / Calling Custom Functions from a Requester

16 ASL Library / Calling Custom Functions from a Requester ]" border=0> The ASL_HookFunc tag passes an ASL requester a pointer to a custom function. The requester can use this function for two purposes. The first is to determine if the requester should display a particular file or font name. The other purpose is to process messages that the requester receives at its IDCMP port that are not meant for the requester. Hook functions are set up through flag values used with the ASL_FuncFlags tag: Hook Function Flag Used For ------------------ -------- FILF_DOWILDFUNC Call user hook function on each name in a file requester FONF_DOWILDFUNC Call user hook function on each name in a font requester FILF_DOMSGFUNC Call user hook function for IDCMP messages not used by a file requester FONF_DOMSGFUNC Call user hook function for IDCMP messages not used by a font requester The FILF_DOWILDFUNC and FONF_DOWILDFUNC flags cause a requester to call the function you specify with the ASL_HookFunc tag for every file or font entry. The requester displays the file or font name only if your hook function tells it to. For a file requester, if your hook function returns a zero, the file requester will display the file name. For a font requester, if your hook function returns anything but zero, the font requester will display the font name and size. The FILF_DOMSGFUNC and FONF_DOMSGFUNC flags cause a requester to call your hook function whenever it receives an IntuiMessage that it cannot use at the IDCMP port that it shares with your window. (See the section on " ASL Requesters and Custom Screens " earlier in this chapter for more information about sharing IDCMP ports.) If the requester receives any messages that are not meant for the requester it will call your hook function (specified with the ASL_HookFunc tag). Your hook function is responsible for returning a pointer to the IntuiMessage. The requester will take care of replying to the message.
