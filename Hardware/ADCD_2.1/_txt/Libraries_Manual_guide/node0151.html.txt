5 / / Mutual Exclude / Gadget Highlighting for Mutual Exclusion ]" border=0> When using complement mode highlighting, the image supplied must be at least the size of the complemented area (the gadget select box). An extended boolean gadget with a mask may be used to constrain the area that is highlighted. Alternate image highlighting may be used provided the two images have exactly the same size and position. Likewise, a border and alternate border may be used provided the two borders are identical in shape and position, differing only in color. Do not use other combinations for mutual exclude gadgets such as a gadget with a border that uses complement mode highlighting or a gadget which uses highlighting by drawing a box. See the section on " Updating a Gadget's Imagery " for more information. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
