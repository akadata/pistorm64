1 / General Development Guidelines / 68010/020/030/040 Compatibility ]" border=0> Special care must be taken to be compatible with the entire family of 68000 processors: * Do not use the upper 8 bits of a pointer for storing unrelated information. The 68020, 68030, and 68040 use all 32 bits for addressing. * Do not use signed variables or signed math for addresses. * Do not use software delay loops, and do not make assumptions about the order in which asynchronous tasks will finish. * The stack frame used for exceptions is different on each member of the 68000 family. The type identification in the frame must be checked! In addition, the interrupt autovectors may reside in a different location on processors with a VBR register. * Do not use the MOVE SR, instruction! This 68000 instruction acts differently on other members of the 68000 family. If you want to get a copy of the processor condition codes, use the Exec library GetCC() function. * Do not use the CLR instruction on a hardware register which is triggered by Write access. The 68020 CLR instruction does a single Write access. The 68000 CLR instruction does a Read access first, then a Write access. This can cause a hardware register to be triggered twice. Use MOVE.x #0, instead. * Self-modifying code is strongly discouraged. All 68000 family processors have a pre-fetch feature. This means the CPU loads instructions ahead of the current program counter. Hence, if your code modifies or decrypts itself just ahead of the program counter, the pre-fetched instructions may not match the modified instructions. The more advanced processors prefetch more words. If self-modifying code must be used, flushing the cache is the safest way to prevent troubles. * The 68020, 68030 and 68040 processors all have instruction caches. These caches store recently used instructions, but do not monitor writes. After modifying or directly loading instructions, the cache must be flushed. See the Exec library CacheClearU() Autodoc for more details. If your code takes over the machine, flushing the cache will be trickier. You can account for the current processors, and hope the same techniques will work in the future: CACRF_ClearI EQU $0008 ;Bit for clear instruction cache ; ;Supervisor mode only. Use this only if you have taken over ;the machine.
