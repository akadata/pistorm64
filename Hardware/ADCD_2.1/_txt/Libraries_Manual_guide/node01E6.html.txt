TITLE: 10 / The Mouse / Intuition's Use of Mouse Events

10 / The Mouse / Intuition's Use of Mouse Events ]" border=0> When the mouse is moved or its buttons are pressed, the system generates input events that represent the actions. The input events are taken from the input chain by Intuition when the active window requires the events. Note that only input for a specific window will be affected by changes in that window's IDCMP flags. Most events generated by the user with the mouse are used by Intuition. As the user moves the mouse, Intuition changes the position of its pointer. The Intuition pointer moves around the entire video display, mimicking the user's movement of the mouse. The user points at an object by positioning the hot spot of the pointer over the object. The hot spot is the active part of the pointer image; the hot spot for Intuition's default pointer is the pixel at the tip of the arrow. After pointing to an object, the user can perform some action on that object by selecting it with one of the mouse buttons. These can include any of the actions specified above, such as dragging or double clicking. The left mouse button is generally used for selection, while the right mouse button is most often used for information transfer. The terms selection and information are intentionally left open to some interpretation, as it is impossible to imagine all the possible uses for the mouse buttons. The selection/information paradigm can be crafted to cover most interaction between the user and an application. When using the mouse, the application should emphasize this model. It will help the user to understand and remember the mouse control of the application. Applications that handle mouse button events directly, bypassing the menu and gadget systems, should use the same selection/information model used by Intuition.
