15 / GadTools Menus / Language-Sensitive Menus ]" border=0> Allowing the application to switch the language displayed in the menus, can be done quite easily. Simply detach the menu strip and replace the strings in the IntuiText structures as described above. It may be convenient to store some kind of index number in the Menu and MenuItem UserData which can be used to retrieve the appropriate string for the desired language. After all the strings have been installed, call LayoutMenus() and SetMenuStrip() . If the application has the localized strings when the menus are being created, it simply places the pointers to the strings and command shortcuts into the appropriate fields of the NewMenu structure. The menus may then be processed in the normal way. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
