18 Exec Libraries / What is a Library? ]" border=0> A library consists of a group of functions somewhere in memory (ROM or RAM), a vector table, and a Library structure which can be followed by an optional private data area for the library. The library's base pointer (as returned by OpenLibrary() ) points to the library's Library data structure: struct Library { struct Node lib_Node; UBYTE lib_Flags; UBYTE lib_pad; UWORD lib_NegSize; /* number of bytes before library */ UWORD lib_PosSize; /* number of bytes after library */ UWORD lib_Version; UWORD lib_Revision; APTR lib_IdString; ULONG lib_Sum; /* the checksum itself */ UWORD lib_OpenCnt; /* number of current opens */ }; /* Meaning of the flag bits: */ /* A task is currently running a checksum */ #define LIBF_SUMMING (1 Using a Library to Reference Data Relationship of Libraries to Devices Minimum Subset of Library Vectors Changing the Contents of a Library [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
