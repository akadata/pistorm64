1 / / Multitasking / What the System Doesn't Do For You ]" border=0> The Amiga operating system handles most of the housekeeping needed for multitasking , but this does not mean that applications don't have to worry about multitasking at all. The current generation of Amiga systems do not have hardware memory protection, so there is nothing to stop a task from using memory it has not legally acquired. An errant task can easily corrupt some other task by accidentally overwriting its instructions or data. Amiga programmers need to be extra careful with memory; one bad memory pointer can cause the machine to crash (debugging utilities such as MungWall and Enforcer will prevent this). In fact, Amiga programmers need to be careful with every system resource, not just memory. All system resources from audio channels to the floppy disk drives are shared among tasks. Before using a resource, you must ask the system for access to the resource. This may fail if the resource is already being used by another task. Once you have control of a resource, no other task can use it, so give it up as soon as you are finished. When your program exits, you must give everything back whether it's memory, access to a file, or an I/O port. You are responsible for this, the system will not do it for you automatically. ______________________________________________________________________ | | | What Every Amiga Programmer Should Know: | | ---------------------------------------- | | The Amiga is a multitasking computer. Keep in mind that other | | tasks are running at the same time as your application. Always ask | | the system for control of any resource you need; some other task may | | already be using it. Give it back as soon as you are done; another | | task may want to use it. This applies to just about every computing | | activity your application can perform. | |______________________________________________________________________| [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
