35 Math Libraries / FFP Basic Mathematics Library ]" border=0> The FFP basic math library contains entries for the basic mathematics functions such as add, subtract and divide. It resides in ROM and is opened by calling OpenLibrary() with "mathffp.library" as the argument. #include #include #include struct Library *MathBase; VOID main() { if (MathBase = OpenLibrary("mathffp.library", 0)) { . . . CloseLibrary(MathBase); } else printf("Can't open mathffp.library\n"); } The global variable MathBase is used internally for all future library references.
