27 / / Forming a Basic Display / Preparing the ViewPort Structure ]" border=0> To prepare the ViewPort structure for further use, you call InitVPort() and initialize certain fields as follows: InitVPort(&viewPort); /* Initialize the ViewPort. */ viewPort.RasInfo = &rasInfo; /* The rasInfo must also be initialized */ viewPort.DWidth = WIDTH; viewPort.DHeight = HEIGHT; /* Under 1.3, you should set viewPort.Modes here to select a display * mode. Under Release 2, use VideoControl() with VTAG_NORMAL_DISP_SET * to select a display mode by attaching a DisplayInfo structure to * the ViewPort. */ The InitVPort() routine presets certain default values in the ViewPort structure. The defaults include: * Modes variable set to zero--this means you select a low-resolution display. (To alter this, use VideoControl() with the VTAG_NORMAL_DISP_SET tag as explained below.) * Next variable set to NULL--no other ViewPort is linked to this one. If you want a display with multiple ViewPorts, you must fill in the link yourself. If you want to create a View with two or more ViewPort s you must declare and initialize the ViewPorts as above. Then link them together using the ViewPort.Next field with a NULL link for the ViewPort at the end of the chain: viewPortA.Next = &viewPortB; /* Tell 1st one the address of the 2nd. */ viewPortB.Next = NULL; /* There are no others after this one. */ For Release 2 applications, once a ViewPort has been prepared, a ViewPortExtra structure must also be created with GfxNew() , initialized, and associated with the ViewPort via the VideoControl() function. In addition, a DisplayInfo for this mode must be attached to the ViewPort. The fragment below shows how to do this. For complete examples, refer to the program listings of RGBBoxes.c and WBClone.c . struct TagItem vcTags[] = /* These tags will be passed to */ { /* the VideoControl() function to */ { VTAG_ATTACH_CM_SET, NULL }, /* set up the extended ViewPort */ { VTAG_VIEWPORTEXTRA_SET, NULL }, /* structures required in Release */ { VTAG_NORMAL_DISP_SET, NULL }, /* 2. The NULL ti_Data field of */ { VTAG_END_CM, NULL } /* these tags must be filled in */ }; /* before making the call to */ /* VideoControl(). */ struct DimensionInfo dimquery; /* Release 2 structure for display size */ /* data */ /* Make a ViewPortExtra and get ready to attach it */ if( vpextra = GfxNew(VIEWPORT_EXTRA_TYPE) ) { vcTags[1].ti_Data = (ULONG) vpextra; /* Initialize the DisplayClip field of the ViewPortExtra structure */ if( GetDisplayInfoData( NULL , (UBYTE *) &dimquery , sizeof(struct dimquery) , DTAG_DIMS, modeID) ) { vpextra->DisplayClip = dimquery.Nominal; /* Make a DisplayInfo and get ready to attach it */ if( !(vcTags[2].ti_Data = (ULONG) FindDisplayInfo(modeID)) ) fail("Could not get DisplayInfo\n"); } else fail("Could not get DimensionInfo\n"); } else fail("Could not get ViewPortExtra\n"); /* This is for backwards compatibility with, for example, */ /* a 1.3 screen saver utility that looks at the Modes field */ viewPort.Modes = (UWORD) (modeID & 0x0000ffff); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
