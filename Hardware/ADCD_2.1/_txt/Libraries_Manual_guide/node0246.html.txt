14 / The Workbench Library / Workbench Library Functions ]" border=0> AppWindows , AppIcons and AppMenuItems extend the user's ability to perform operations with the Workbench iconic interface. They all provide graphical methods for passing arguments to a running application. In order to manage AppWindows, AppIcons and AppMenuItems, the Amiga OS includes these Workbench library functions: struct AppIcon *AddAppIconA( ULONG, ULONG, char *, struct MsgPort *, struct FileLock *, struct DiskObject *, struct *TagItem ); struct AppMenuItem *AddAppMenuItemA( ULONG, ULONG, char *, struct MsgPort *, struct *TagItem); struct AppWindow *AddAppWindowA( ULONG, ULONG, struct Window *, struct MsgPort *, struct *TagItem); BOOL RemoveAppIcon(struct AppIcon *); BOOL RemoveAppMenuItem(struct AppMenuItem *); BOOL RemoveAppWindow(struct AppWindow *); The functions AddAppMenuItemA() , AddAppWindowA() and AddAppIconA() have alternate entry points using the same function name without the trailing A. The alternate functions accept any TagItem arguments on the stack instead of from an array. See the listings below for examples. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
