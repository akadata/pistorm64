TITLE: B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_ERASEFRAME

B / imageclass / New Methods: IM_ERASEFRAME ]" border=0> This method is a special version of IM_ERASE for images that support IM_DRAWFRAME . It asks an image to erase itself as if it were confined (scaled, clipped, etc.) to a rectangular bounds. The return value for this method is not explicitly defined. This method uses a custom message structure: struct impErase /* NOTE: This is a subset of impDraw */ { ULONG MethodID; /* IM_ERASEFRAME */ struct RastPort *imp_RPort; /* The image's RastPort */ struct { WORD X; /* X and Y offset relative to the */ WORD Y; /* image's IA_Left and IA_Top attributes */ } imp_Offset; struct { WORD Width; /* scale, clip, restrict, etc. to these bounds */ WORD Height; } imp_Dimensions; }; The imageclass dispatcher handles an IM_ERASEFRAME message as if it was an IM_ERASE message, ignoring the bounds. See the imageclass description for IM_ERASE for more details. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
