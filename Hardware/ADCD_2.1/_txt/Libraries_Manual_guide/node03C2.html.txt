28 / / Animation Components / Linking Multiple AnimComp Sequences ]" border=0> When an AnimOb is built from multiple AnimComp sequences, the sequences are linked together by the the PrevComp and NextComp fields of the AnimComps. These pointers must be initialized only in the initial AnimComp of each sequence. The other components that are not initially active should have their PrevComp and NextComp pointers set to NULL. Do Not Use Empty Fields. ------------------------ You cannot store data in the empty PrevComp and NextComp fields. As the system cycles through the AnimComp s, the NextComp and PrevComp fields are set to NULL when an old AnimComps is replaced by a new AnimComp. The new AnimComp is then linked in to the list of sequences in place of the old one. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
