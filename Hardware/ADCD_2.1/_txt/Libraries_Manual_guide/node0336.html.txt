27 / / Monitors, Modes and the Display Database / New Monitors ]" border=0> Currently, there are five possible monitor settings in the display database (more may be added in future releases): default.monitor Since the default system monitor must be capable of displaying an image no matter what chips are installed or what software revision is in ROM, the graphics.library default.monitor is defined as a 15 Khz monitor which can display NTSC in the U.S. or PAL in Europe. ntsc.monitor Since the ECS chip set allows for dynamic choice of standard scan rates, NTSC applications running on European machines may choose to be displayed on the ntsc.monitor to preserve the aspect ratio. pal.monitor Since the ECS chip set allows for dynamic choice of standard scan rates, PAL applications running on American machines may choose to be displayed on the pal.monitor to preserve the aspect ratio. multisync.monitor Programmably variable scan rates from 15 Khz through 31 Khz or more. Responds to signal timings to decide what scan rate to display. Required for Productivity (640 x 480 x 2 non-interlaced) display. A2024.monitor Scan converter monitor which provides 1008 x 800 x 2 (U.S.) or 1008 x 1024 x 2 (European) high-resolution, greyscale display. Does not require ECS. Does require Release 2 (or 1.3 V35) graphics library. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
