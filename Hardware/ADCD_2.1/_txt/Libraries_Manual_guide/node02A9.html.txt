20 / Memory Functions / Allocating System Memory ]" border=0> The following examples show how to allocate memory. APTR apointer,anotherptr, yap; if (!(apointer = AllocMem(100, MEMF_ANY))) { /* COULDN'T GET MEMORY, EXIT */ } AllocMem() returns the address of the first byte of a memory block that is at least 100 bytes in size or NULL if there is not that much free memory. Because the requirement field is specified as MEMF_ANY (zero), memory will be allocated from any one of the system-managed memory regions. if (!(anotherptr = (APTR)AllocMem(1000, MEMF_CHIP | MEMF_CLEAR))) { /* COULDN'T GET MEMORY, EXIT */ } The example above allocates only chip-accessible memory, which the system fills with zeros before it lets the application use the memory. If the system free memory list does not contain enough contiguous memory bytes in an area matching your requirements, AllocMem() returns a zero. You must check for this condition. If you are using Release 2, you can use the AllocVec() function to allocate memory. In addition to allocating a block of memory, this function keeps track of the size of the memory block, so your application doesn't have to remember it when it deallocates that memory block. The AllocVec() function allocates a little more memory to store the size of the memory allocation request. if (!(yap = (APTR)AllocVec(512, MEMF_CLEAR))) { /* COULDN'T GET MEMORY, EXIT */ } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
