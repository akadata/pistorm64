TITLE: 27 / / Monitors, Modes and the Display Database / New Modes

27 / / Monitors, Modes and the Display Database / New Modes ]" border=0> In V1.3 and earlier versions of the OS, the mode for a display was determined by a 16 bit-value specified either in the ViewPort.Modes field (for displays set up with the graphics library) or in the NewScreen.ViewModes field (for displays set up with Intuition). Prior to Release 2, it was sufficient to indicate the mode of a display by setting bits in the ViewPort.Modes field. Furthermore, programs routinely made interpretations about a given display mode based on bit-by-bit testing of this 16-bit value. Table 27-4: ViewPort Modes Used in 1.3 Bit Name 1.3 ViewPort Modes --- ---- ------------------ 15 HIRES RP 14 SPRITE DC 13 VPHIDE DC R = respected by 1.3 12 reserved IP I = ignored by 1.3 11 HAM RP D = dynamic 10 DUALPF RP C = cleared on write by 1.3 9 reserved IP IFF writers 8 GENAUD IC P = preserved on write by 1.3 7 EHB RP IFF writers 6 PFBA (PF2PRI) RP 5 reserved IP 4 reserved IP 3 reserved IP 2 LACE RP 1 GENVID IC 0 reserved IP Considering all the possible new mode combinations and the need for future expansion, it is clear that the 16-bit mode specification used in 1.3 needs to be extended. Also, the specification of a mode needs to be separated from its interpretation. Furthermore, since modes can be grouped by the special monitor or physical device needed for the display, it is also beneficial to make provisions to support additional monitors and their modes in the future. The approach taken in Release 2 is to introduce a new 32-bit display mode specifier called a ModeID. The upper half of this specifier is called the monitor part and the lower half is informally called the mode part. There is a correspondence between the monitor part and the monitor's operating modes (referred to as virtual monitors or MonitorSpec s after a system data structure). For example, the A2024 monitor, PAL and NTSC are all different virtual monitors--the actual, physical monitor may be able to support more than one of these virtual types. Another new concept in Release 2 is the default monitor. The default monitor, represented by a zero value for the ModeID monitor part, may be either PAL or NTSC depending on a jumper on the motherboard. Compatibility considerations--especially for IFF files and their CAMG chunk--have dictated very careful choices for the bit values which make up the mode part of the 32-bit ModeIDs. For example, the ModeIDs corresponding to the older, 1.3 display modes have been constructed out of a zero in the monitor part and the old 16-bit ViewPort.Modes bits in the lower part (after several extraneous bits such as SPRITES and VP_HIDE are cleared). There are other such coincidences, but steps for compatibility with old programs notwithstanding, there is a new rule: Programmers shall never interpret ModeIDs on a bit-by-bit basis. For example, if the HIRES bit is set it does not mean the display is 640 pixels wide because there can also be a doubling of the beam scan rate under Release 2. Programs should not attempt to interpret modes directly from the ViewPort.Modes field. The Release 2 graphics library provides a suitable substitute for this information through its new display database facility (explained below). Likewise, under Release 2, the Mode of a ViewPort is no longer set directly. Instead it is set indirectly by associating the ViewPort with an abstract, 32-bit ModeID via the VideoControl() function. These 32-bit ModeIDs have been carefully designed so that their lower 16 bits, when passed to graphics in the ViewPort.Modes field, provide some degree of compatibility between different systems. Older V1.3 programs will continue to work within the new scheme. (They will, however, not gain the benefits of the new modes and monitors available.)
