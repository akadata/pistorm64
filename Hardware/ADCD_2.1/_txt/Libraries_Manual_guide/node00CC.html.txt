TITLE: 2 / How the User Sees Intuition / Intuition's 3D Look

2 / How the User Sees Intuition / Intuition's 3D Look ]" border=0> The Amiga operating system comes in different versions . The latest version, Release 2 , contains significant improvements in the appearance of the Intuition graphical user interface, usually referred to as the 3D Look of Intuition. Figure 2-2: An Example of the 3D Look of Intuition In the new 3D look of Intuition, objects are drawn so that light appears to come from the upper left of the display with shadows cast to the lower right. Using light and shadow gives the illusion of depth so that images appear to stand out or recede from the display. By convention, an image with a raised appearance indicates an object that is available for use or modifiable. An image with a recessed appearance indicates an object that is unmodifiable, or for display purposes only. Applications should follow the same conventions. Release 2 has other improvements over 1.3 (V34) and earlier versions of the operating system. Among these are new display resolutions , display sizes, and new function libraries to support Intuition. Most of the examples listed in this book assume Release 2. Where appropriate, the old 1.3 methods are also described. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
