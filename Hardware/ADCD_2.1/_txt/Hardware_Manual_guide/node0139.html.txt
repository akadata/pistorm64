TITLE: F / Register Functional Description / Input Modes

F / Register Functional Description / Input Modes ]" border=0> Control bits (CRA5, CRB5-6) allow selection of the clock used to decrement the timer. Timer A can count 02 clock pulses or external pulses applied to the CNT pin. Timer B can count 02 pulses, external CNT pulses, timer A underflow pulses, or timer A underflow pulses while the CNT pin is held high. The timer latch is loaded into the timer on any timer underflow, on a force load, or following a write to the high byte of the pre- scalar while the timer is stopped. If the timer is running, a write to the high byte will load the timer latch but not the counter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
