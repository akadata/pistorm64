K / / Expansion Bus Loading / Clock Signals ]" border=0> All clock signals on the bus are in this group. Many designs are very sensitive to clock delay, skew, and rise/fall times, so loading on the clock lines must be kept to a minimum. These are bussed signals, actively driven by the backplane, and source terminated with a low value series resistor. PICs can apply one standard load to each of these signals when necessary. Zorro II cards have the same clock rules, so there should never be clocking problems when using either card type in a backplane. /C3 CDAC /C1 7M E Clock [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
