TITLE: 4 / Creating Additional Sprites / Sprite Priority

4 / Creating Additional Sprites / Sprite Priority ]" border=0> When you have more than one sprite on the screen, you may need to take into consideration their relative video priority, that is, which sprite appears in front of or behind another. Each sprite has a fixed video priority with respect to all the others. The lowest numbered sprite has the highest priority and appears in front of all other sprites; the highest numbered sprite has the lowest priority. This is illustrated in Figure 4-8. More about priorities. ---------------------- See Chapter 7, "System Control Hardware," for more information on sprite priorities . _______ | | ___|___ 7 | | |___| ___|___ 6 | | |___| ___|___ 5 | | |___| ___|___ 4 | | |___| ___|___ 3 | | |___| ___|___ 2 | | |___| ___|___ 1 | | |___| | 0 | |_______| Figure 4-8: Sprite Priority [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
