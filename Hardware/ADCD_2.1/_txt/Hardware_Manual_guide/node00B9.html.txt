TITLE: 4 / Forming a Sprite / Building the Data Structure

4 / Forming a Sprite / Building the Data Structure ]" border=0> After defining the sprite, you need to build its data structure, which is a series of 16-bit words in a contiguous memory area. Some of the words contain position and control information and some contain color descriptions. To create a sprite's data structure, you need to: * Write the horizontal and vertical position of the sprite into the first control word. * Write the vertical stopping position into the second control word. * Translate the decimal color numbers 0 - 3 in your sprite grid picture into binary color numbers. Use the binary values to build color descriptor (data) words and write these words into the data structure. * Write the control words that indicate the end of the sprite data structure. Warning: -------- Sprite data, like all other data accessed by the custom chips, must be loaded into Chip RAM. Be sure all of your sprite data structures are word aligned in Chip Memory. Table 4-1 shows a sprite data structure with the memory location and function of each word: Memory Location 16-bit Word Function -------- ----------- -------- N Sprite control word 1 Vertical and horizontal start position N+1 Sprite control word 2 Vertical stop position N+2 Color descriptor low word Color bits for line 1 N+3 Color descriptor high word Color bits for line 1 N+4 Color descriptor low word Color bits for line 2 N+5 Color descriptor high word Color bits for line 2 - - - End-of-data words Two words indicating the next usage of this sprite Table 4-1: Sprite Data Structure All memory addresses for sprites are word addresses. You will need enough contiguous memory to provide room for two words for the control information, two words for each horizontal line in the sprite, and two end-of-data words. Because this data structure must be accessible by the special-purpose chips, you must ensure that this data is located within chip memory. Figure 4-7 shows how the data structure relates to the sprite. ___________________________ __ | | | | Each group of words | VSTART, HSTART | | defines one vertical | |---------------------------| | usage of a sprite. | VSTOP, control bits | |--- Each one contains the | |___________________________| | starting location and | physical appearance | ___________________________ - | - of this sprite image. | | | | | | low word of data, line 1 | | |---------------------------| | | | | high word of data, line 1 | | |___________________________| | | | | ------ | | increasing ------ data describing | Pairs of words addresses ------ central lines | |- - containing color ------ if this sprite | information for | ------ | | pixel lines. ___________________________ | | | | | | | low word of data, line 1 | | | |---------------------------| | | | high word of data, line 1 | | | |___________________________| __| | - - - | ___________________________ | | Last word pair contains | | 0000000000000000 | all zeros if this sprite |---------------------------|- - - - processor is to used | | 0000000000000000 | only once vertically in \|/ |___________________________| the display frame.
