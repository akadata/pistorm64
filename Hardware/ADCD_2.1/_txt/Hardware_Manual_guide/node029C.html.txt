TITLE: K / Zorro II Compatibility / Signal Description

K / Zorro II Compatibility / Signal Description ]" border=0> The Zorro II bus can be broken down into various logical signal groups. Some of these groups are unchanged in the Zorro III bus modes, others are drastically different. This section makes note of the original Zorro II name for each signal and the current Zorro III physical pin name for each signal, where different. Some of this information will be repeated in the Zorro III sections, where appropriate; nothing in this section is considered critical to understanding the Zorro III bus, but it is useful. As previously mentioned, the A2000 bus signals unsupported by the Zorro II specification have been deleted from the Zorro III specification and the A3000 implementation of Zorro III; this section will, however, document those signals for reference purposes. Please see the Physical and Logical Signal Names section for a complete list with pin numbers of the various logical signals that appear on the physical bus during the different phases of the Zorro II and Zorro III bus cycles.
