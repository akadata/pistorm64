TITLE: K / / Expansion Bus Loading / Open Collector Signals

K / / Expansion Bus Loading / Open Collector Signals ]" border=0> Many of the bus signals are shared via open collector or open drain outputs rather than via tri-stated signals; this is of course required for some asynchronous things like the shared interrupt lines, and it works well for other types of signals as well. Of course, a backplane resistor pulls these lines high, PICs only drive the line low. /OWN /BGACK /CINH /BERR /DTACK /RESET /INT2 /INT6 /HLT [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
