TITLE: 4 / Displaying a Sprite / Resetting the Address Pointers

4 / Displaying a Sprite / Resetting the Address Pointers ]" border=0> For one single display field, the system will automatically read the data structure and produce the sprite on-screen in the colors that are specified in the sprite's color registers . If you want the sprite to be displayed in subsequent display fields, you must rewrite the contents of the sprite pointers during each vertical blanking interval. This is necessary because during the display field, the pointers are incremented to point to the data which is being fetched as the screen display progresses. The rewrite becomes part of the vertical blanking routine, which can be handled by instructions in the Copper lists. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
