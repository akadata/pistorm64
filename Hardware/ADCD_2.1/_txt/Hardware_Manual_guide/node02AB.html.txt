K / Zorro III Bus Architecture / Quick Bus Arbitration ]" border=0> The Zorro II bus does an adequate job of supporting multiple bus masters, and the Zorro III bus extends this somewhat by introducing fair arbitration to Zorro II cards. However, some desirable features cannot be added directly to the Zorro II arbitration protocol. Specifically, Zorro III bus arbitration is much faster than the Zorro II style, it prohibits bus hogging that's possible under the Zorro II protocol, and it supports intelligent bus load balancing. Load balancing requires a bit of explanation. A good analogy is to that of software multitasking; there, an operating system attempts to slice up CPU time between all tasks that need such time; here, a bus controller attempts to slice up bus time between all masters that need such time. With preemptive multitasking such as in the Amiga and UNIX OSs, equal CPU time can be granted to every task (possibly modified by priority levels), and such scheduling is completely under control of the OS; no task can hog the CPU time at the expense of all others. An alternate multitasking scheme is a popular add-on to some originally non-multitasking operating systems lately. In this scheme, each task has the CPU until it decides to give up the CPU, basically making the effectiveness of the CPU sharing at the mercy of each task. This is exactly the same situation with masters on the Zorro II bus. The Zorro III arbitration mechanism attempts to make bus scheduling under the control of the bus controller, with masters each being scheduled on a cycle-by-cycle basis. When a Zorro III PIC wants to master the bus, it registers with the bus controller. This tells the bus controller to include that PIC in its scheduling of the expansion bus. There may be any number of other PICs registered with the bus controller at any given time. The CPU is always scheduled expansion bus time, and other local bus devices, such as a hard disk controller, may be registered from time to time. Once registered, a PIC sits idle until it receives a grant from the bus controller. A grant is permission from the bus controller that allows the PIC to master the Zorro III bus for one full cycle. A PIC always gets one full cycle of bus time when given a grant, and assuming it stays registered, it may receive additional full cycles. Within the full cycle, the PIC may run any number of Multiple Transfer Cycles , assuming of course the responding slave supports such cycles. For multiprocessor support, a PIC will be granted multiple atomic full cycles if it locks the bus. This feature is only for support of hardware semaphores and other such multiprocessor needs; it is not intended as a means of bus hogging! ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ __ C7M | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |___| |___| |___| |___| |___| |___| |___| |___| Register Unregister ________ _______________________ __________________ /BRn | | | | |_______| |_______| __________________________ _________________________________ /BGn | | |______| ______________________________ _______________ /FCS | | |____________________| _____________________ ______________ /OWN | | |______________________________| _______________________ ____________ /BGACK | | |______________________________| Figure K-7: Zorro III Bus Arbitration Figure K-7 shows the basics of Zorro III bus arbitration. While it uses some of the same signals as the 680x0 inspired Zorro II bus arbitration mechanism, it has nothing to do with 680x0 bus arbitration; the /BRn and /BGn signals should be thought of as completely new signals. In order to register with the bus controller as a bus master, a PIC asserts its private /BRn strobe on the rising edge of the 7M clock, and negates it on the next rising edge. The bus controller will indicate mastership to a registered bus master by asserting its /BGn . Once granted the bus, the PIC drives only the standard cycle signals: addresses, /FCS , /EDSn, data, etc. in a full cycle. The bus controller manages the assertion of /OWN and /BGACK , which are important only for bus management and Zorro II support. While a scheduling scheme isn't part of this bus specification, the bus master will only be guaranteed one bus cycle at a time. The /BGn line is negated shortly after the master asserts /FCS unless the bus controller is planning to grant multiple full cycles to the master. A locked bus will force the controller to grant multiple full cycles. Any master that works better with multiple cycles, such as devices with buffers to empty into memory, should run a Multiple Transfer Cycle to transfer several longwords during the same full cycle. For this reason, slave cards are encouraged to support Multiple Transfer Cycles , even if they don't necessarily run any faster during them. Once a registered bus master has no more work to do, it unregisters with the bus controller. This works just like registering -- the PIC asserts /BRn on the rise of 7M , then negates it on next rising 7M . This is best done during the last cycle the bus master requires on the bus. If a registered master gets a grant before unregistering and has no work to do, it can unregister without asserting /FCS , to give back the bus without runing a cycle. It's always far better to make sure that the master unregisters as quickly as possible. Bus timeout causes an automatic unregistering of the registered master that was granted that timed-out cycle; this guarantees that an inactive registered master can't drag down the system. If a master sees a /BERR during a cycle, it should terminate that cycle immediately and re-try the same cycle. If the retried cycle results in a /BERR as well, nothing more can be done in hardware; notification of the driver program is the usual recourse. The bus controller may have to mix Zorro II style bus arbitration in with Zorro III arbitration, as Zorro II and Zorro III cards can be freely mixed in a backplane. Because of this, Multiple Transfer Cycles , and the self-timed nature of Zorro III cards, there's no way to guarantee the latency between bus grants for a Zorro III card. The bus controller does, however, make sure that all masters are fairly scheduled so that no starvation occurs, if at all possible. Zorro III cards must use Zorro III style bus arbitration; although current Zorro III backplanes can't differentiate between Zorro II and Zorro III cards when they request (other than by the request mechanism), it can't be assumed that a backplane will support Zorro III cycles with Zorro II mastering, or visa-versa.
