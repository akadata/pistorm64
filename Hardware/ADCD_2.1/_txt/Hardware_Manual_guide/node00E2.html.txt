5 / Forming and Playing a Sound / Audio Summary ]" border=0> These are the steps necessary to produce a steady tone: 1. Define the waveform. 2. Create the data set containing the pairs of data samples (data words). Normally, a data set contains the definition of one waveform. 3. Set the location registers: AUDxLCH (high three bits) AUDxLCL (low fifteen bits) 4. Set the length register, AUDxLEN , to the number of data words to be retrieved before starting at the address currently in AUDxLC . 5. Set the volume register, AUDxVOL . 6. Set the period register, AUDxPER 7. Start the audio DMA by writing a 1 into bit 9, DMAEN , along with a 1 in the SET/CLR bit and a 1 in the position of the AUDxEN bit of the channel or channels you want to start.
