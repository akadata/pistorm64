Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: 5 Audio Hardware ]" border=0> This chapter shows you how to directly access the audio hardware to produce sounds. The major topics in this chapter are: * A brief overview of how a computer produces sound. * How to produce simple steady and changing sounds and more complex ones. * How to use the audio channels for special effects, wiring them for stereo sound if desired, or using one channel to modulate another. * How to produce quality sound within the system limitations. A section at the end of the chapter gives you values to use for creating musical notes on the equal-tempered musical scale. This chapter is not a tutorial on computer sound synthesis; a thorough description of creating sound on a computer would require a far longer document. The purpose here is to point the way and show you how to use the Amiga's features. Computer sound production is fun but complex, and it usually requires a great deal of trial and error on the part of the user -- you use the instructions to create some sound and play it back, readjust the parameters and play it again, and so on. The following works are recommended for more information on creating music with computers: * Wayne A. Bateman, Introduction to Computer Music (New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1980). * Hal Chamberlain, Musical Applications of Microprocessors (Rochelle Park, New Jersey: Hayden, 1980).
