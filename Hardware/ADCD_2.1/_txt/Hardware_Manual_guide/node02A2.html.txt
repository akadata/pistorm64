TITLE: K / / Signal Description / Addressing and Control Signals

K / / Signal Description / Addressing and Control Signals ]" border=0> These signals are various items used for the addressing of devices in Zorro II mode by the local bus and any expansion DMA devices. Most of these signals are very much like 68000 generated bus signals bi-directionally buffered to allow any DMA device on the bus to drive the local bus when such a device is the bus master. Read Enable (READ) This is the read enable for the bus, which is equivalent to the 68000's R/W output. READ asserted during a bus cycle indicates a read cycle, READ negated indicates a write cycle. Note that this signal may become valid in a cycle earlier than a 68000 R/W line would, but it remains valid at least as long at the cycle's end. Address Bus (A1-A23) This is logically equivalent to the 68000's address bus, providing 16 megabytes of address space, although much of that space is not assigned to the expansion bus (see the memory map in Figure K-1 . Address Strobe (/AS) := ( /CCS ) for Zorro III This is equivalent to the 68000 /AS, called /CCS , for Compatibility Cycle Strobe, in the Zorro III nomenclature. The falling edge of this strobe indicates that addresses are valid, the READ line is valid, and a Zorro II cycle is starting. The rising edge signals the end of a Zorro II bus cycle, signaling the current slave to negate all slave-driven signals as quickly as possible. Note that /CCS , like /AS, can stay asserted during a read-modify-write access over multiple cycle boundaries. To correctly support such cycles, a device must consider both the state of /CCS and the state of the data strobes. Many current Zorro II cards don't correctly support this 680x0 style bus lock. Data Bus (D0-D15) This is a buffered version of the 680x0 data bus, providing 16 bits of data accessible by word or either byte. A PIC uses the DOE signal to determine when the bus is to be driven on reads, and the data strobes to determine when data is valid on writes. Data Strobes (/UDS, /LDS) := ( /DS3, /DS2 ) for Zorro III These strobes fall on data valid during writes, and indicate byte select for both reads and writes. The lower strobe is used for the lower byte (even byte), the upper strobe is used for the upper byte (odd byte). There is one slight difference between these lines and the 68000 data strobes. On reads of Zorro II memory space, both /DS3 and /DS2 will be asserted, no matter what the actual size of the requested transfer is. This is required to support caching of the Zorro II memory space. For Zorro II I/O space, these strobes indicate the actual, requested byte enables, just as would a 68000 bus master. Data Transfer Acknowledge (/DTACK) This signal is used to normally terminate both Zorro bus cycles. For Zorro II modes, it is equivalent to the 68000's Data Transfer Acknowledge input. It can be asserted by the bus slave during a Zorro II cycle at any time, but won't be sampled by the bus master until the falling edge of the S4 state on the bus. Data will subsequently be latched on the S6 falling edge after this, and the cycle terminated with /AS negated during S7. If a Zorro II slave does nothing, this /DTACK will be driven by the bus controller with no wait states, making the bus essentially a 4-cycle synchronous bus. Any slow device on the bus that needs wait states has two options. It can modify the automatic /DTACK negating XRDY to hold off /DTACK. Alternately, it may assert /OVR to inhibit the bus controller's generation of /DTACK, allowing the slave to create its own /DTACK. Any /DTACK supplied by a slave must be driven with an open-collector or similar type output; the backplane provides a passive pullup. Processor Status (FC0-FC2) These signals are the cycle type or memory space bits, equivalent for the most part with the 68000 Processor Status outputs. They function mainly as extensions to the bus address, indicating which type of access is taking place. For Zorro II devices, any use of these lines must be gated with /BGACK , since they are not driven valid by Zorro II bus masters. However, when operating on the Zorro III backplane, Zorro II masters that don't drive the function codes will be seen generating an FC1 = 0, which results in a valid memory access. Zorro II cycles are not generated for invalid memory spaces when the CPU is the bus master. /DTACK Override (/OVR) This signal is driven by a Zorro II slave to allow that slave to prevent the bus controller's /DTACK generation. This allows the slave to generate its own /DTACK. The previous use of this line to disable motherboard memory mapping, which was unsupported on the A2000 expansion bus, has now been completely removed. The use of XDRY or /OVR in combination with /DTACK is completely up to the board designer -- both methods are equally valid ways for a slave to delay /DTACK. In Zorro III mode , this pin is used for something completely different. External Ready (XRDY) This active high signal allows a slave to delay the bus controller's assertion of /DTACK, in order to add wait states. XRDY must be negated within 60ns of the bus master's assertion of /AS, and it will remain negated until the slave wants /DTACK. The /DTACK signal will be asserted by the bus controller shortly following the assertion of XRDY, providing the bus cycle is a S4 or later. XRDY is a wired-OR from all PICs, and as such, must be driven by an open collector or equivalent output. In Zorro III mode , this pin is used for something completely different.
