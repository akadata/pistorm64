3 / Forming a Basic Playfield / Enabling the Color Display ]" border=0> The stock A1000 has a color composite output and requires bit 9 (COLOR_ON) set in BPLCON0 to create a color composite display signal. Without the addition of specialized hardware, the A500, A2000 and A3000 cannot generate color composite output. NOTE: ----- The color burst enable does not affect the RGB video signal. RGB video is correctly generated regardless of the output of the composite video signal. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
