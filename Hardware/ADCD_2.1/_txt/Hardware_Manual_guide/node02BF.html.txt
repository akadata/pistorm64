K / / Expansion Bus Loading / Non-bussed Signals ]" border=0> The non-bussed, or slot specific, signals are involved with only one slot on the bus (e.g., each slot has its own copy). As a result, the drive requirements are much less for these signals. The backplane provides pullups or pulldowns, as required by the specific signal. /CFGINn /CFGOUTn /BRn /BGn SenseZ3 /SLAVEn [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
