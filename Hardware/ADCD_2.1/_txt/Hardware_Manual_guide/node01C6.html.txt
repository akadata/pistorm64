Glossary / burst ]" border=0> A short name for Multiple Transfer Cycle mode. Essentially, within one full Zorro III cycle there can be any number of Multiple Transfer Cycles. Each full cycle has a complete 32-bit address supplied and a complete 32-bit datum transferred. Each burst cycle supplies only the 8-bit page address, but transfers a complete 32-bit datum faster than the standard full cycle would allow. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
