5 / Producing High-quality Sound / Sampling Rate ]" border=0> If you need high precision in your frequency output, you may find that the frequency you wish to produce is somewhere between two available sampling rates, but not close enough to either rate for your requirements. In those cases, you may have to adjust the length of the audio data table in addition to altering the sampling rate. For higher frequencies, you may also need to use audio data tables that contain more than one full cycle of the audio waveform to reproduce the desired frequency more accurately, as illustrated in Figure 5-4.
