8 / Controller Port Interface / Reading Proportional Controllers ]" border=0> Each of the game controller ports can handle two variable-resistance input devices, also known as proportional input devices. This section describes how the positions of the proportional input devices can be determined. There are two common types of proportional controllers: the "paddle" controller pair and the X-Y proportional joystick. A paddle controller pair consists of two individual enclosures, each containing a single resistor and fire-button and each connected to a common controller port input connector. Typical connections are shown in Figure 8-4.
