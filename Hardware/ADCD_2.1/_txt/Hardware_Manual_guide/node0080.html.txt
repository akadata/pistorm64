3 / / When Picture is Larger than Window / Specifying the Modulo ]" border=0> For a memory picture wider than the display window, you need to respecify the modulo so that the correct data words are fetched for each line of the display. As an example, assume the display window is the standard 320 pixels wide, so 40 bytes are to be displayed on each line. The big picture in memory, however, is exactly twice as wide as the display window, or 80 bytes wide. Also, assume that you wish to display the left half of the big picture. Figure 3-14 shows the relationship between the big picture and the picture to be displayed.

The modulo, which is 40, is added to the current value of the pointer so that when it begins the data fetch for the next line, it fetches the data that you intend for that line. The data fetch for line 2 is shown in Figure 3-16. _______________________________________________________________________ | | | Data for line 2: | | | | Location: START+80 START+82 START+84 ... START+118 | | -------- -------- -------- --------- | | leftmost next word next word last display | | display word word | |_______________________________________________________________________| Figure 3-16: Data Fetch for the Second Line When Modulo = 40 To display the right half of the big picture, you set up vertical blanking routine to start the bitplane pointers at location START+40 rather than START with the modulo remaining at 40. The data layout is shown in Figures 3-17 and 3-18. _______________________________________________________________________ | | | Data for line 1: | | | | Location: START+40 START+42 START+44 ... START+78 | | -------- -------- -------- -------- | | leftmost next word next word last display | | display word word | |_______________________________________________________________________| Figure 3-17: Data Layout for First Line -- Right Half of Big Picture Now, the bitplane pointers contain the value START+80. The modulo (40) is added to the pointers so that when they begin the data fetch for the second line, the correct data is fetched. _______________________________________________________________________ | | | Data for line 2: | | | | Location: START+120 START+122 START+124 ... START+158 | | --------- --------- --------- --------- | | leftmost next word next word last display | | display word word | |_______________________________________________________________________| Figure 3-18: Data Layout for Second Line -- Right Half of Big Picture Remember, in high resolution mode, you need to fetch twice as many bytes as in low resolution mode. For a normal-sized display, you fetch 80 bytes for each horizontal line instead of 40. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
