A Register Summary / SPRxDATA, SPRxDATB ]" border=0> Agnus/ Read/ Denise/ Register Address Write Paula Function -------- ------- ----- ------- -------- SPRxDATA 144 W D Sprite x image data register A SPRxDATB 146 W D Sprite x image data register B These registers buffer the sprite image data. They are usually loaded by the sprite DMA channel but may be loaded by either processor at any time. When a horizontal comparison occurs, the buffers are dumped into shift registers and serially outputted to the display, MSB first on the left. NOTE: Writing to the A buffer enables (arms) the sprite. Writing to the SPRxCTL register disables the sprite. If enabled, data in the A and B buffers will be outputted whenever the beam counter equals the sprite horizontal position value in the SPRxPOS register. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
