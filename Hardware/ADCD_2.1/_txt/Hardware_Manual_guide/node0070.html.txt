3 / / Size Display Window / Setting Display Window Starting Position ]" border=0> A horizontal starting position of approximately $81 and a vertical starting position of approximately $2C centers the display on most standard television screens. If you select high resolution mode (640 pixels horizontally) or interlaced mode (400 lines NTSC, 512 PAL) the starting position does not change. The starting position is always interpreted in low resolution, non-interlaced mode. In other words, you select a starting position that represents the correct coordinates in low resolution, non-interlaced mode. The register DIWSTRT (for "Display Window Start") controls the display window starting position. This register contains both the horizontal and vertical components of the display window starting positions, known respectively as HSTART and VSTART. The following example sets DIWSTRT for a basic playfield. You write $2C for VSTART and $81 for HSTART. LEA CUSTOM,a0 ; Get base address of custom hardware...
