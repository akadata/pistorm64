TITLE: 6 Blitter Hardware / Blitter Operations and System DMA

6 Blitter Hardware / Blitter Operations and System DMA ]" border=0> The operations of the blitter affect the performance of the rest of the system. The following sections explain how system performance is affected by blitter direct memory access priority, DMA time slot allocation, bus sharing between the 680x0 and the display hardware, the operations of the blitter and Copper, and different playfield display sizes. The blitter performs its various data-fetch, modify, and store operations through DMA sequences, and it shares memory access with other devices in the system. Each device that accesses memory has a priority level assigned to it, which indicates its importance relative to other devices. Disk DMA, audio DMA, display DMA, and sprite DMA all have the highest priority level. Display DMA has priority over sprite DMA under certain circumstances. Each of these four devices is allocated a group of time slots during each horizontal scan of the video beam. If a device does not request one of its allocated time slots, the slot is open for other uses. These devices are given first priority because missed DMA cycles can cause lost data, noise in the sound output, or on-screen interruptions. The Copper has the next priority because it has to perform its operations at the same time during each display frame to remain synchronized with the display beam sweeping across the screen. The lowest priorities are assigned to the blitter and the 68000, in that order. The blitter is given the higher priority because it performs data copying, modifying, and line drawing operations operations much faster than the 68000. During a horizontal scan line (about 63 microseconds), there are 227.5 "color clocks", or memory access cycles. A memory cycle is approximately 280 ns in duration. The total of 227.5 cycles per horizontal line includes both display time and non-display time. Of this total time, 226 cycles are available to be allocated to the various devices that need memory access. The time-slot allocation per horizontal line is: 4 cycles for memory refresh 3 cycles for disk DMA 4 cycles for audio DMA (2 bytes per channel) 16 cycles for sprite DMA (2 words per channel) 80 cycles for bitplane DMA (even- or odd-numbered slots according to the display size used) Figure 6-9 shows one complete horizontal scan line and how the clock cycles are allocated. Figure 6-9: DMA Time Slot Allocation The 68000 uses only the even-numbered memory access cycles. The 68000 spends about half of a complete processor instruction time doing internal operations and the other half accessing memory. Therefore, the allocation of alternate memory cycles to the 68000 makes it appear to the 68000 that it has the memory all of the time, and it will run at full speed. Some 68000 instructions do not match perfectly with the allocation of even cycles and cause cycles to be missed. If cycles are missed, the 68000 must wait until its next available memory slot before continuing. However, most instructions do not cause cycles to be missed, so the 68000 runs at full speed most of the time if there is no blitter DMA interference. Figure 6-10 illustrates the normal cycle of the 68000. Avoid the TAS instruction. -------------------------- The 68000 test-and-set instruction (TAS) should never be used in the Amiga; the indivisible read-modify-write cycle that is used only in this instruction will not fit into a DMA memory access slot. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | operation | access | | portion | portion | | | | | | | | odd cycle, | even cycle, | | assigned to | available to | | other devices | the 68000 | | | | | | | | | | | | | Figure 6-10: Normal 68000 Cycle If the display contains four or fewer low resolution bitplanes, the 68000 can be granted alternate memory cycles (if it is ready to ask for the cycle and is the highest priority item at the time). However, if there are more than four bitplanes, bitplane DMA will begin to steal cycles from the 68000 during the display. During the display time for a six bitplane display (low resolution, 320 pixels wide), 160 time slots will be taken by bitplane DMA for each horizontal line. As you can see from Figure 6-11, bitplane DMA steals 50 percent of the open slots that the processor might have used if there were only four bitplanes displayed. - timing cycle - T T + 7 + * + * _______________________________________________________________ | | | | | | | | | | | 4 | 6 | 2 | | 3 | 5 | 1 | |_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______| Figure 6-11: Time Slots Used by a Six Bitplane Display If you specify four high resolution bitplanes (640 pixels wide), bitplane DMA needs all of the available memory time slots during the display time just to fetch the 40 data words for each line of the four bitplanes (40 * 4 = 160 time slots). This effectively locks out the 68000 (as well as the blitter or Copper) from any memory access during the display, except during horizontal and vertical blanking . - timing cycle - T T + 7 _______________________________________________________________ | | | | | | | | | | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | |_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______| Figure 6-12: Time Slots Used by a High Resolution Display Each horizontal line in a normal, full-sized display contains 320 pixels in low resolution mode or 640 pixels in high resolution mode. Thus, either 20 or 40 words will be fetched during the horizontal line display time. If you want to scroll a playfield , one extra data word per line must be fetched from the memory. Display size is adjustable (see Chapter 3, "Playfield Hardware"), and bitplane DMA takes precedence over sprite DMA. As shown in Figure 6-9 larger displays may block out one or more of the highest-numbered sprites, especially with scrolling. As mentioned above, the blitter normally has a higher priority than the processor for DMA cycles. There are certain cases, however, when the blitter and the 68000 can share memory cycles. If given the chance, the blitter would steal every available Chip memory cycle. Display, disk, and audio DMA take precedence over the blitter, so it cannot block them from bus access. Depending on the setting of the blitter DMA mode bit, commonly referred to as the "blitter-nasty" bit, the processor may be blocked from bus access. This bit is called DMAF_BLITHOG (bit 10) and is in register DMACON . If DMAF_BLITHOG is a 1, the blitter will keep the bus for every available Chip memory cycle. This could potentially be every cycle (ROM and Fast memory are not typically Chip memory cycles). If DMAF_BLITHOG is a 0, the DMA manager will monitor the 68000 cycle requests. If the 68000 is unsatisfied for three consecutive memory cycles, the blitter will release the bus for one cycle. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
