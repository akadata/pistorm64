TITLE: K / / Changes from the A2000 Bus / DMA Latency and Overlap

K / / Changes from the A2000 Bus / DMA Latency and Overlap ]" border=0> Zorro II bus masters in a Zorro III backplane will, in many cases, receive a bus grant much sooner than they would in a standard Zorro II backplane. Additionally, in some cases, expansion bus cycles will overlap local bus cycles. The latency incurred on the Zorro II bus during heavy custom chip activity has been greatly reduced for any Zorro III bus master. This should be transparent to the card in question, though keep this in mind. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
