TITLE: Glossary / local bus

Glossary / local bus ]" border=0> The main system bus of an Amiga computer is called the local bus. In general, the main CPU, video chips, chip memory, and any other built-in resources are on the local bus. The bus controller sits on both the local and expansion buses and manages the communications between them. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
