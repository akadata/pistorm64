3 / Basic Playfield / Telling the System How to Fetch and Display Data ]" border=0> After defining the size and position of the display window, you need to give the system the on-screen location for data fetched from memory. To do this, you describe the horizontal positions where each line starts and stops and write these positions to the data-fetch registers. The data-fetch registers have a four-pixel resolution (unlike the display window registers, which have a one-pixel resolution). Each position specified is four pixels from the last one. Pixel 0 is position 0; pixel 4 is position 1, and so on. The data-fetch start and display window starting positions interact with each other. It is recommended that data-fetch start values be restricted to a programming resolution of 16 pixels (8 clocks in low resolution mode, 4 clocks in high resolution mode). The hardware requires some time after the first data fetch before it can actually display the data. As a result, there is a difference between the value of window start and data-fetch start of 4.5 color clocks . The normal low resolution DDFSTRT is ($0038). The normal high resolution DDFSTRT is ($003C). Recall that the hardware resolution of display window start and stop is twice the hardware resolution of data fetch: $81 --- - 8.5 = $38 2 $81 --- - 4.5 = $3C 2 The relationship between data-fetch start and stop is DDFSTRT = DDFSTOP - (8 * (word count - 1)) for low resolution DDFSTRT = DDFSTOP - (4 * (word count - 2)) for high resolution The normal low resolution DDFSTOP is ($00D0). The normal high resolution DDFSTOP is ($00D4). The following example sets data-fetch start to $0038 and data-fetch stop to $00D0 for a basic playfield. LEA CUSTOM,a0 ; Point to base hardware address MOVE.W #$0038,DDFSTRT(a0) ; Write to DDFSTRT MOVE.W #$00D0,DDFSTOP(a0) ; Write to DDFSTOP You also need to tell the system exactly which bytes in memory belong on each horizontal line of the display. To do this, you specify the modulo value. Modulo refers to the number of bytes in memory between the last word on one horizontal line and the beginning of the first word on the next line. Thus, the modulo enables the system to convert bitplane data stored in linear form (each data byte at a sequentially increasing memory address) into rectangular form (one "line" of sequential data followed by another line). For the basic playfield, where the playfield in memory is the same size as the display window, the modulo is zero because the memory area contains exactly the same number of bytes as you want to display on the screen. Figures 3-10 and 3-11 show the basic bitplane layout in memory and how to make sure the correct data is retrieved. The bitplane address pointers ( BPLxPTH and BPLxPTL ) are used by the system to fetch the data to the screen. These pointers are dynamic; once the data fetch begins, the pointers are continuously incremented to point to the next word to be fetched (data is fetched two bytes at a time). When the end-of-line condition is reached (defined by the data-fetch register, DDFSTOP) the modulo is added to the bitplane pointers, adjusting the pointer to the first word to be fetched for the next horizontal line. _______________________________________________________________________ | | | Data for line 1: | | | | Location: START START+2 START+4 ...

The modulo (in this case, 0) is added to the current value of the pointer, so when the pointer begins the data fetch for the next line, it fetches the data you want on that line. The data for the next line begins at memory location START+40. _______________________________________________________________________ | | | Data for line 2: | | | | Location: START+40 START+42 START+44 ... START+78 | | -------- -------- -------- -------- | | leftmost next word next word last display | | display word word | |_______________________________________________________________________| Figure 3-11: Data Fetched for the Second Line When Modulo = 0 Note that the pointers always contain an even number, because data is fetched from the display a word at a time. There are two modulo registers -- BPL1MOD for the odd-numbered bitplanes and BPL2MOD for the even-numbered bitplanes. This allows for differing modulos for each playfield in dual-playfield mode . For normal applications, both BPL1MOD and BPL2MOD will be the same. The following example sets the modulo to 0 for a low resolution playfield with one bitplane. The bitplane is odd-numbered.
