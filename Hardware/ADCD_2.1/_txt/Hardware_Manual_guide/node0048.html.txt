TITLE: 2 Coprocessor Hardware / About the Copper

2 Coprocessor Hardware / About the Copper ]" border=0> The Copper is a general purpose coprocessor that resides in one of the Amiga's custom chips. It retrieves its instructions via direct memory access (DMA). The Copper can control nearly the entire graphics system, freeing the 680x0 to execute program logic; it can also directly affect the contents of most of the chip control registers. It is a very powerful tool for directing mid-screen modifications in graphics displays and for directing the register changes that must occur during the vertical blanking periods. Among other things, it can control register updates, reposition sprites, change the color palette, update the audio channels, and control the blitter. One of the features of the Copper is its ability to WAIT for a specific video beam position, then MOVE data into a system register. During the WAIT period, the Copper examines the contents of the video beam position counter directly. This means that while the Copper is waiting for the beam to reach a specific position, it does not use the memory bus at all. Therefore, the bus is freed for use by the other DMA channels or by the 680x0. When the WAIT condition has been satisfied, the Copper steals memory cycles from either the blitter or the 680x0 to move the specified data into the selected special-purpose register. The Copper is a two-cycle processor that requests the bus only during odd-numbered memory cycles. This prevents collision with audio, disk, refresh, sprites, and most low resolution display DMA access, all of which use only the even-numbered memory cycles. The Copper, therefore, needs priority over only the 680x0 and the blitter (the DMA channel that handles animation, line drawing, and polygon filling). As with all the other DMA channels in the Amiga system, the Copper can retrieve its instructions only from the chip RAM area of system memory. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
