Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: C Enhanced Chip Set ]" border=0> This appendix contains information on the Enhanced Chip Set (ECS). The Enhanced Chip Set consists of the Agnus (8372-R3) and Denise (8373-R3) custom Amiga chips. These chip revisions support advanced features in addition to all of the standard features previously available. The ECS is standard in the A3000. The enhanced Agnus and Denise chips are plug-compatible replacements for the originals in the A500 or A2000. There are no provisions for installing the ECS in the original A1000. The A2000, when jumpered for one megabyte of chip memory, will function normally with the ECS chips installed, under both V1.3 and V2.0 Amiga System software. The ECS chips are designed to function with either NTSC or PAL Amigas. However, the chips from the US factory are configured for NTSC mode. In order to use them on a PAL system, you may have to reset the motherboard jumpers for proper performance.
