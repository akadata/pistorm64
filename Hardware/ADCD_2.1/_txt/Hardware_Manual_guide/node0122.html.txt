TITLE: 6 Blitter Hardware / Area Fill Mode

6 Blitter Hardware / Area Fill Mode ]" border=0> In addition to copying data, the blitter can simultaneously perform a fill operation during the copy. The fill operation has only one restriction -- the area to fill must be defined first by drawing untextured lines with only one bit set per horizontal row. A special line draw mode is available for this operation. Use a standard copy blit (or any other blit, as area fills take place after all shifts , masks and logical combination of sources). Descending mode must be used. Set either the inclusive-fill-enable bit (FILL_OR, or bit 3) or the exclusive-fill-enable bit (FILL_XOR, or bit 4) in BLTCON1 . The inclusive fill mode fills between lines, leaving the lines intact. The exclusive fill mode fills between lines, leaving the lines bordering the right edge of filled regions but deleting the lines bordering the left edge. Exclusive fill yields filled shapes one pixel narrower than the same pattern filled with inclusive fill. For instance, the pattern: 00100100-00011000 filled with inclusive fill, yields: 00111100-00011000 with exclusive fill, the result would be 00011100-00001000 (Of course, fills are always done on full 16-bit words.) There is another bit (FILL_CARRYIN or bit 3 in BLTCON1 ) that forces the area "outside" the lines be filled; for the above example, with inclusive fill, the output would be 11100111-11111111 with exclusive fill, the output would be 11100011-11110111 before after ______________________ ______________________ | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1 1 1 1 | | 11111 11111 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 1111 1111 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 111 111 | | 11 11 | | 11 11 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 111 111 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 1111 1111 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 11111 11111 | | | | | | | | | |______________________| |______________________| Figure 6-5: Use of the FCI Bit - Bit Is a 0 If the FCI bit is a 1 instead of a 0, the area outside the lines is filled with 1s and the area inside the lines is left with 0s in between. before after ______________________ ______________________ | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1 1 1 1 | | 111 1111111 11 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 1111 11111111 11 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 11111 111111111 11 | | 11 11 | | 111111111111111111 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 11111 111111111 11 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 1111 11111111 11 | | 1 1 1 1 | | 111 1111111 11 | | | | | | | | | |______________________| |______________________| Figure 6-6: Use of the FCI Bit - Bit Is a 1 If you wish to produce very sharp, single-point vertices, exclusive-fill enable must be used.

For each "1" bit in the source area, the blitter flips the fill state, either filling or not filling the space with ones. This continues for each line until the left edge of the blit is reached, at which point the filling stops. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
