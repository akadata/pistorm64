E / / Parallel Interface Specification / Pin Assignment (J8) ]" border=0> NAME DIR NOTES ---- --- ------------------------ DRDY* O Output-data-ready signal to parallel device in output mode, used in conjunction with ACK* (pin 10) for a two-line asynchronous handshake. Functions as input data accepted from Amiga in input mode (similar to ACK* in output mode). See timing diagrams in the following section. D0 I/O + D1 I/O | D2 I/O | D3 I/O | D0-D7 comprise an eight-bit bidirectional bus D4 I/O | for communication with parallel devices, D5 I/O | nominally, a printer. D6 I/O | D7 I/O + ACK* I Output-data-acknowledge from parallel device in output mode, used in conjunction with DRDY* (pin 1) for a two-line asynchronous handshake. Functions as input-data-ready from parallel device in input mode (similar to DRDY* in output mode). See timing diagrams . The 8520 can be programmed to conditionally generate a level 2 interrupt to the 680x0 whenever the ACK* input goes active. BUSY I/O This is a general purpose I/O pin also connected to a serial data I/O pin (serial clock on pin 12). Note: Nominally used to indicate printer buffer full. POUT I/O This is a general purpose I/O pin to a serial clock I/O pin (serial data on pin 11). Note: Nominally used to indicate printer paper out. SEL I/O This is a general purpose I/O pin. Note: nominally a select output from the parallel device to the Amiga. On the A500/A2000 also shared with RS232 "ring indicator" signal. RESET* O Amiga system reset [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
