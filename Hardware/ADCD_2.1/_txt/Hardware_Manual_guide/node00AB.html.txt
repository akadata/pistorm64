C / ECS Hardware and the Graphics Library / Other ECS Modifications ]" border=0> The preceding sections cover most of the ECS registers appearing in the ECS register map. This section briefly describes the remaining modifications to the Enhanced Chip Set registers. The following registers now have two additional bits for addressing larger segments of memory, when the Enhanced Chip Set is present: DSKPTH 020 W A Disk pointer (high 5 bits, was 3 bits) BLTxPTH 050 W A Blitter pointer to x (high 5 bits, was 3 bits) COP1LCH 080 W A Coprocessor 1st location (high 5 bits,was 3 bits) COP2LCH 084 W A Coprocessor 2nd location (high 5 bits,was 3 bits) AUDxLCH 0A0 W A Audio channel x location (high 5 bits was 3 bits) The Strobe Long Line register (STRLONG) can be disabled if the Disable Long Line (LOLDIS) bit is set in the BEAMCON0 register. STRLONG 03E S D Strobe for identification of long horiz line See the Multi-Sync and Bi-Sync Monitors section in this appendix for the bit descriptions in BEAMCON0. Bit 7 (DOFF) of the BLTCON1 register, when set, disables the output of the Blitter hardware on channel D. BLTCON1 042 W A Blitter control register 1 This allows inputs to channels A, B and C and certain address modification if necessary, without the Blitter outputting over channel D. The BLTCON0L register writes the low bits of BLTCON0, thereby expediting the set up of some blits and generally speeding up the software, since the upper bits are often the same. BLTCON0L 05A W A Blitter control 0, lower 8 bits (minterms) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
