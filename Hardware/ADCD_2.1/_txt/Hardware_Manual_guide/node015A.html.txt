TITLE: 7 System Control Hardware / Collision Detection

7 System Control Hardware / Collision Detection ]" border=0> You can use the hardware to detect collisions between one sprite group and another sprite group , any sprite group and either of the playfields, the two playfields, or any combination of these items. The first kind of collision is typically used in a game operation to determine if a missile has collided with a moving player. The second kind of collision is typically used to keep a moving object within specified on-screen boundaries. The third kind of collision detection allows you to define sections of playfield as individual objects, which you may move using the blitter. This is called playfield animation. If one playfield is defined as the backdrop or playing area and the other playfield is used to define objects (in addition to the sprites), you can sense collisions between the playfield-objects and the sprites or between the playfield-objects and the other playfield.
