Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: D System Memory Maps ]" border=0> A true software memory map, showing system utilization of the various sections of RAM and free space is not provided, nor possible with the Amiga. All memory is dynamically allocated by the memory manager at boot time, and the actual locations of system structures may change from release-to-release, machine-to-machine, or boot-to-boot (see the AllocMem() function in the exec.library for more details). Likewise, Amiga applications are compiled in such a way that they can be dynamically relocated at run time by the system loader. To find the location of system structures, application software should use the function interface provided in the operating system. If this is not possible then the address of a data structure should be obtained by searching the lists of system structures maintained by Exec. The first step is to fetch the address of the exec.library from location 4; this is the only absolute memory location in the system. All other system data structures are indirectly linked to this base address. Though a detailed system memory map is not possible, this section does present the general layout of memory areas within the current generation of Amiga computers. To ensure maximum compatibility, avoid relying on the address ranges given here. Instead use the system provided interfaces to ask for the system reources you need.
