TITLE: 7 System Control Hardware / Beam Position Detection

7 System Control Hardware / Beam Position Detection ]" border=0> Sometimes you might want to synchronize the 680x0 processor to the video beam that is creating the screen display. In some cases, you may also wish to update a part of the display memory after the system has already accessed the data from the memory for the display area. The address for accessing the beam counter is provided so that you can determine the value of the video beam counter and perform certain operations based on the beam position. NOTE: ----- The Copper is already capable of watching the display position for you and doing certain register-based operations automatically. Refer to the Copper Interrupts section and Chapter 2, Coprocessor Hardware for further information. In addition, when you are using a light pen, this same address is used to read the light pen position rather than the beam position. This is described fully in Chapter 8, "Interface Hardware."
