TITLE: 3 / Forming a Basic Playfield / Allocating Memory for Bitplanes

3 / Forming a Basic Playfield / Allocating Memory for Bitplanes ]" border=0> After you set the number of bitplanes and specify resolution modes, you are ready to allocate memory. A bitplane consists of an end-to-end sequence of words at consecutive memory locations. When operating under the Amiga operating system, use a system call such as AllocMem() to remove a block of memory from the free list and make it available to the program. A specialized allocation function named AllocRaster() in the graphics.library is recommended for all bitplane allocations. AllocRaster() will pad the allocation to properly align scan lines for the hardware. If the machine has been taken over, simply reserve an area of memory for the bitplanes. Next, set the bitplane pointer registers ( BPLxPTH/BPLxPTL ) to point to the starting memory address of each bitplane you are using. The starting address is the memory word that contains the bits of the upper left-hand corner of the bitplane. Tables 3-7 and 3-8 show how much memory is needed for basic playfield modes under NTSC and PAL, respectively. You may need to balance your color and resolution requirements against the amount of available memory you have. Table 3-7: Playfield Memory Requirements, NTSC Number of Bytes Picture Size Modes per Bitplane ------------ ----- --------------- 320 X 200 Low resolution, 8,000 non-interlaced 320 X 400 Low resolution, 16,000 interlaced 640 X 200 High resolution, 16,000 non-interlaced 640 X 400 High resolution, 32,000 interlaced Keep in mind that the number of bytes you allocate for a bitplane must be even. Table 3-8: Playfield Memory Requirements, PAL Number of Bytes Picture Size Modes per Bitplane ------------ ----- --------------- 320 X 256 Low resolution, 8,192 non-interlaced 320 X 512 Low resolution, 16,384 interlaced 640 X 256 High resolution, 16,384 non-interlaced 640 X 512 High resolution, 32,768 interlaced NTSC Example of Bitplane Size [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
