TITLE: 4 Sprite Hardware / Moving a Sprite

4 Sprite Hardware / Moving a Sprite ]" border=0> A sprite generated in automatic mode can be moved by specifying a different position in the data structure . For each display field, the data is reread and the sprite redrawn. Therefore, if you change the position data before the sprite is redrawn, it will appear in a new position and will seem to be moving. You must take care that you are not moving the sprite (that is, changing control word data) at the same time that the system is using that data to find out where to display the object. If you do so, the system might find the start position for one field and the stop position for the following field as it retrieves data for display. This would cause a "glitch" and would mess up the screen. Therefore, you should change the content of the control words only during a time when the system is not trying to read them. Usually, the vertical blanking period is a safe time, so moving the sprites becomes part of the vertical blanking tasks and is handled by the Copper as shown in the example below. As sprites move about on the screen, they can collide with each other or with either of the two playfields. You can use the hardware to detect these collisions and exploit this capability for special effects. In addition, you can use collision detection to keep a moving object within specified on-screen boundaries. Collision Detection is described in Chapter 7, "System Control Hardware." sprite_move.asm [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
