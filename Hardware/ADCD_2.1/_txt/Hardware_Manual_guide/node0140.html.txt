F / Serial Shift Register (SDR) / Output Mode ]" border=0> In the output mode, Timer A is used as the baud rate generator. Data is shifted out on the SP pin at 1/2 the underflow rate of Timer A . The maximum baud rate possible is 02 divided by 4, but the maximum usable baud rate will be determined by line loading and the speed at which the receiver responds to input data. To begin transmission, you must first set up Timer A in continuous mode, and start the timer. Transmission will start following a write to the serial data register. The clock signal derived from Timer A appears as an output on the CNT pin. The data in the serial data register will be loaded into the shift register, then shifted out to the SP pin when a CNT pulse occurs. Data shifted out becomes valid on the next falling edge of CNT and remains valid until the next falling edge. After eight CNT pulses, an interrupt is generated to indicate that more data can be sent. If the serial data register was reloaded with new information prior to this interrupt, the new data will automatically be loaded into the shift register and transmission will continue. If no further data is to be transmitted after the eighth CNT pulse, CNT will return high and SP will remain at the level of the last data bit transmitted. SDR data is shifted out MSB first. Serial input data should appear in this same format. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
