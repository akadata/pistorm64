7 / / Setting and Clearing Bits / Serial Port Interrupts ]" border=0> The following serial interrupts are associated with the specified bits of the interrupt registers . Bit 11, RBF (for receive buffer full), specifies that the input buffer of the UART has data that is ready to read. This bit generates a level 5 interrupt . Bit 0, TBE (for "transmit buffer empty"), specifies that the output buffer of the UART needs more data and data can now be written into this buffer. This bit generates a level 1 interrupt .
