K / Zorro III Bus Architecture / Basic Zorro III Bus Cycles ]" border=0> The basic Zorro III bus cycle is a multiplexed address/data cycle which supplies a full 32 bits worth of address and data per simple cycle. The cycle is a fully asynchronous cycle. The bus master for a given cycle supplies strobes to indicate when address is valid, write data is valid, and read data may be driven. In return, the bus slave for a cycle supplies a strobe to indicate that it is responding to a bus address, and a strobe to indicate that it is done with the bus data for a write cycle, or has supplied valid bus data for a read cycle. The minimum theoretical bus speed is governed only by setup and hold time requirements for the various bus signals. Actual bus speeds are always a function of the bus master and bus slave active for a given cycle. This is considerably different than the Zorro II bus, and for several good reasons, which are explained below. Design Goals Simple Bus Cycle Operation [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
