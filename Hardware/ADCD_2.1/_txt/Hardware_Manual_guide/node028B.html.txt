TITLE: Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: K Zorro Expansion Bus

Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: K Zorro Expansion Bus ]" border=0> This appendix describes the complete Zorro III bus, first implemented in the Amiga 3000 computer. The Zorro III bus is a performance 32-bit expansion bus that is also upward compatible with the Zorro II bus (Amiga 2000 expansion bus). The main intent of the Zorro III bus is to allow fast 32-bit peripherals and memory devices to be added to a high performance Amiga, such as the Amiga 3000, while at the same time allowing standard Zorro II devices to be used wherever they make sense in such a system. This compatibility also insures that the Amiga 3000 will have a number of hardware and software compatible expansion devices available upon introduction, and that Amiga 2000 owners will be able to take their expansion card investment along with them should they migrate to a higher performance Amiga.
