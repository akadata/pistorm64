Channels 1 and 2 are connected to the left-side stereo output jack. Channels 0 and 3 are connected to the right-side output jack. Select a channel on the side from which the output is to appear. [1]: Belage says (in November 2020): [...] in the printed manual Amiga HRM 1e, 6th print, August 1988, page 136 you can find the following: DECIDING WHICH CHANNEL TO USE The Amiga has four audio channels. Channels 0 and 3 are connected to the left-side stereo output jack. Channels 1 and 2 are connected to the right-side output jack. Select a channel on the side from which the output is to appear. [...] So in the web version you find: 0-3 = R-L-L-R. In the printed manual you find: 0-3 = L-R-R-L, which is identical how the real hardware works. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
