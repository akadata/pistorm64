TITLE: 5 / Forming and Playing a Sound / Stopping the Audio Dma

5 / Forming and Playing a Sound / Stopping the Audio Dma ]" border=0> You can stop the channel by writing a 0 into the AUDxEN bit at any time. However, you cannot resume the output at the same point in the waveform by just writing a 1 in the bit again. Enabling an audio channel almost always starts the data output again from the top of the list of data pointed to by the location registers for that channel. If the channel is disabled for a very short time (less than two sampling periods ) it may stay on and thus continue from where it left off. The following example shows how to stop audio DMA for one channel. STOPAUDCHAN0: LEA CUSTOM,a0 MOVE.W #(DMAF_AUD0), DMACON (a0) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
