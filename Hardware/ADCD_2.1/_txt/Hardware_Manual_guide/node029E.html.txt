K / / Signal Description / Clock Signals ]" border=0> The Zorro III expansion bus provides clock signals for expansion boards. These clocks are for synchronous Zorro II designs and for other synchronous activity such as bus arbitration. While originally based on Amiga local bus clocks, these have no guaranteed relationship to any local bus activity in newer Amiga computers, but are maintained in Amiga computers as part of the expansion bus specification. The relationship between these clocks is illustrated in Figure K-3. /C1 Clock This is a 3.58 MHz clock (3.55 MHz on PAL systems) that's synched to the falling edge of the 7M system clock. /C3 Clock This is a 3.58 MHz clock (3.55 MHz on PAL systems) that's synched to the rising edge of the 7M system clock. CDAC Clock This is a 7.16 MHz system clock (7.09 MHz on PAL systems) which trails the 7M clock by 90 degrees (approximately 35ns). E Clock This is the 68000 generated "E" clock, used for 6800 family peripherals driven by "E" and 6502 peripherals driven by phi(2). This clock is four 7M clocks high, six clocks low, as per the 68000 spec. Note that the bus does not support the rest of the 68000's 6800/6502 compatible interface; there may be better ways to clock such devices. E7M Clock This is the 7.16 MHz system clock (7.09 MHz on PAL systems). This clock forms the basis for all Zorro II/68000 compatible activity, and for various other system functions, such as bus arbitration. 140ns | | ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ _ C7M | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |___| |___| |___| |___| |___| |___| |___| |___| | | 75| | | ->| ns| | | [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
