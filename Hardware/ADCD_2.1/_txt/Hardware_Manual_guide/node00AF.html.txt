4 Sprite Hardware / What are Sprites? ]" border=0> Sprites are graphic objects that are created and moved independently of the playfield display and independently of each other. Together with playfields, sprites form the graphics display of the Amiga. You can create more complex animation effects by using the blitter, which is described in the chapter called "Blitter Hardware." Sprites are produced on-screen by eight special-purpose sprite DMA channels . Basic sprites are 16 pixels wide and any number of lines high. You can choose from three colors for a sprite's pixels, and a pixel may also be transparent, showing any object behind the sprite. For larger or more complex objects, or for more color choices, you can combine sprites . Sprite DMA channels can be reused several times within the same display field. Thus, you are not limited to having only eight sprites on the screen at the same time. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
