8 / Serial I/O Interface / Introduction To Serial Circuitry ]" border=0> The Paula custom chip contains a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, or UART. This UART is programmable for any rate from 110 to over 1,000,000 bits per second. It can receive or send data with a programmable length of eight or nine bits. The UART implementation provides a high degree of software control. The UART is capable of detecting overrun errors, which occur when some other system sends in data faster than you remove it from the data-receive register. There are also status bits and interrupts for the conditions of receive buffer full and transmit buffer empty. An additional status bit is provided that indicates "all bits have been shifted out". All of these topics are discussed in folowing sections. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
