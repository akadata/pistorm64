K / / Signal Description / Power Connections ]" border=0> The Zorro III expansion bus provides several different voltages designed to supply expansion devices. There are no changes here that affect Zorro II cards. Digital Ground (Ground) This is the digital supply ground used by all expansion cards as the return path for all expansion supplies. Main Supply (+5VDC) This is the main power supply for all expansion cards, and it is capable of sourcing large currents; each expansion slot can draw up to 2.0 Amps @ +5VDC. The extra power for one card in any backplane drawing up to 4.0 Amps @ +5VDC is no longer supported. Negative Supply (-5VDC) This is a negative version of the main supply, for small current loads only. There is no maximum load specified for the Zorro II bus on a per-slot basis; the A2000 implementation specifies 0.3 Amps @ -5VDC for the entire system. High Voltage Supply (+12VDC) This is a higher voltage supply, useful for communications cards and other devices requiring greater than digital voltage levels. This is intended for relatively small current loads only. There is no maximum load specified for the Zorro II bus on a per-slot basis; the A2000 implementation specifies 8.0 Amps @ +12VDC for the entire system, most of which is normally devoted to floppy and hard disk drive motors, not slots. Negative High Supply (-12VDC) Negative version of the high voltage supply, also commonly used in communications applications, and similarly intended for small loads only. There is no maximum load specified for the Zorro II bus on a per-slot basis; the A2000 implementation specifies 0.3 Amps @ -12VDC for the entire. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
