TITLE: 1 Introduction / Components of the Amiga

1 Introduction / Components of the Amiga ]" border=0> These are the hardware components of the Amiga: * Motorola MC68000 16/32-bit main processor. The Amiga also supports the 68010, 68020, and 68030 processors as an option. The A1000, A500 and A2000 contain the 68000, while the A3000 utilizes the 68030 processor. * Custom graphics and audio chips with DMA capability. All Amiga models are equipped with three custom chips named Paula, Agnus, and Denise which provide for superior color graphics, digital audio, and high-performance interrupt and I/O handling. The custom chips can access up to 2MB of memory directly without using the 68000 CPU. * From 256K to 2 MB of RAM expandable to a total of 8 MB (over a gigabyte on the Amiga 3000). * 512K of system ROM containing a real time, multitasking operating system with sound, graphics, and animation support routines. (V1.3 and earlier versions of the OS used 256K of system ROM.) * Built-in 3.5 inch double sided disk drive with expansion floppy disk ports for connecting up to three additional disk drives (either 3.5 inch or 5.25 inch, double sided). * SCSI disk port for connecting additional SCSI disk drives (A3000 Only). * Fully programmable parallel and RS-232-C serial ports. * Two button opto-mechanical mouse and two reconfigurable controller ports (for mice, joysticks, light pens, paddles, or custom controllers). * A professional keyboard with numeric keypad, 10 function keys, and cursor keys. A variety of international keyboards are also supported. * Ports for analog or digital RGB output (all models), monochrome video (A500 and A2000), composite video (A1000), and VGA-style multiscan video (A3000). * Ports for left and right stereo audio from four special purpose audio channels. * Expansion options that allow you to add RAM, additional disk drives (floppy or hard), peripherals, or coprocessors.
