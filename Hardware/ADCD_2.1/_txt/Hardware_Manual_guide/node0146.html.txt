TITLE: F / Control Registers / Control Register A

F / Control Registers / Control Register A ]" border=0> BIT NAME FUNCTION --- ---- -------- 0 START 1 = start Timer A, 0 = stop Timer A. This bit is automatically reset (= 0) when underflow occurs during one-shot mode. 1 PBON 1 = Timer A output on PB6, 0 = PB6 is normal operation. 2 OUTMODE 1 = toggle, 0 = pulse. 3 RUNMODE 1 = one-shot mode, 0 = continuous mode. 4 LOAD 1 = force load (this is a strobe input, there is no data storage; bit 4 will always read back a zero and writing a 0 has no effect.) 5 INMODE 1 = Timer A counts positive CNT transitions, 0 = Timer A counts 02 pulses. 6 SPMODE 1 = Serial port=output (CNT is the source of the shift clock) 0 = Serial port=input (external shift clock is required) 7 UNUSED [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
