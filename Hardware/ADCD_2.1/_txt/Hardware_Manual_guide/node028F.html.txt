TITLE: K / General / The Zorro III Rationale

K / General / The Zorro III Rationale ]" border=0> With the creation of the Amiga 3000, it became clear that the Zorro II bus would not be adequate to support all of that system's needs. The Zorro II bus would continue to be quite useful, as the current Amiga expansion standard, and so it would have to be supported. A few unused pins on the Zorro II bus and the option of a bus controller custom LSI, gave rise to the Zorro III design, which supports the following features: * Compatibility with all Zorro II devices. * Full 32-bit address path for new devices. * Full 32-bit data path for new devices. * Bus speed independent of host system CPU speed. * High speed bus block transfer mode. * Bus locking for multiprocessor support. * Cache disable for simple cache support. * Fair arbitration for all bus masters. * Cycle-by-cycle bus arbitration mode. * High speed interrupt mode. Some of the advanced features, such as burst modes , are designed in such a way as to make them optional; both master and slave arbitrate for them. In addition, it is possible with a bit of extra cleverness, to design a card that automatically configures itself for either Zorro II or Zorro III operation, depending on the status of a sensing pin on the bus. The Zorro III bus is physically based on the same 100-pin single piece connector as the Zorro II bus. While some bus signals remain unchanged throughout bus operation, other signals change based on the specific bus mode in effect at any time. The bus is geographically mapped into three main sections: Zorro II Memory Space, Zorro II I/O Space, and Zorro III Space. The memory map , in Figure K-1 shows how these three spaces are mapped in the A3000 system. The Zorro II space is limited to a 16 megabyte region, and since it has DMA access by convention to chip memory, it is in the original 68000 memory map for any bus implementation. The Zorro III space can physically be anywhere in 32-bit memory. $80000000 ____________ _ _ _ ____________ $01000000 | | | | | | | | Motherboard| | | | ROM | | | | |------------| $00F00000 | | |Zorro II I/O| | Zorro III | | |------------| $00E80000 | expansion | | A2000 | | space | | | motherboard| | | | register | | | | | space | | | |------------| $00B80000 | | | | Zorro II | | | | expansion | | | | | space | $10000000 |------------| |------------| $00A00000 | 32-bit | | | | | memory | | Zorro II | | expansion | | | memory | | space | | expansion | $08000000 |------------| / | space | | A3000 | | | | motherboard| / |------------| $00200000 | space | | Amiga Chip | $01000000 |____________|/ | memory | $00000000 |____________|_ _ _ _ _ _|____________| $00000000 Figure K-1: Expansion Memory Map The Zorro III bus functions in one of two different major modes, depending on the memory address on the bus. All bus cycles start with a 32-bit address, since the full 32-bit address is required for proper cycle typing. If the address is determined to be in Zorro II space, a Zorro II compatible cycle is initiated, and all responding slave devices are expected to be Zorro II compatible 16-bit PICs. Should a Zorro III address be detected, the cycle completes when a Zorro III slave responds or the bus times out, as driven by the motherboard logic. It is very important that no Zorro III device respond in Zorro III mode to a Zorro II bus access; the two types of cycles make very different use of many of the expansion bus lines, and serious buffer contention can result if the cycle types are somehow mixed up. The Zorro III bus of course started with the Zorro II bus as its necessary base, but the Zorro III bus mechanisms were designed as much as possible to solve specific needs for high end Amiga systems, rather than extend any particular Zorro II philosophy when that philosophy no longer made any sense. There are actually several variations of the basic Zorro III cycle, though they all work on the same principles. The variations are for optimization of cycle times and for service of interrupt vectors. But all of this in due time. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
