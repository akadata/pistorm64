TITLE: K / / Signal Description / DMA Control Signals

K / / Signal Description / DMA Control Signals ]" border=0> There are various signals on the expansion bus that coordinate the arbitration of bus masters. Native Zorro III bus masters use some of the same logical signals , but their arbitration protocol is considerably different. PIC is DMA Owner (/OWN) This signal is asserted by an expansion bus DMA device when it becomes bus master. This output is to be treated as a wired-OR output between all expansion slots, any of which may have a PIC signaling bus mastership. Thus, this should be driven with an open-collector or similar output by any PIC using it. This signal is the main basis for data direction calculations between the local and expansion busses, and is pulled up by a backplane resistor. Slot Specific Bus Arbitration (/BRn, /BGn) These are the slot-specific /BRn and /BGn signals, where "n" refers to the expansion slot number. The bus request from each board is taken in by the bus controller and ultimately used to take over the system from 680x0 on the local bus. The bus controller eventually returns one bus grant to the winner among all requesting PICs. From the point of view of the individual PIC, the protocol is very similar to that of the 68000 arbitration mechanism. The PIC asserts /BRn on the rising edge of 7M ; some time later, /BGn is returned on the falling edge of 7M . The PIC waits for all bus activity to finish, asserts /OWN followed by /BGACK, then negates /BRn, assuming bus mastership. It retains mastership until it negates /BGACK followed by /OWN. ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ _ C7M | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |___| |___| |___|\ |___| |___|\ |___| |___| |___| \ | ________ \ ___|_______________________ /BR | | | | |___________________|_________| / | / _________________________ | / ________________________ /BG | | |_______________| _________________________________________________________________ Signals | | | | |___________________________| |_________________| _________________________________ __ /OWN | | |_____________________________| _____________________________________ _____ /BGACK | | |______________________| Figure K-4: Zorro II Bus Arbitration Bus Grant Acknowledge (/BGACK) Any Zorro II PIC that receives a bus grant asserts this signal as long as it maintains bus mastery. This signal may never be asserted until the bus grant has been received, /AS is negated, /DTACK is negated, and /BGACK itself is negated, indicating that all other potential bus masters have relinquished the bus. This output is driven as a wired-OR output, so all PICs must drive it with an open collector or equivalent device, and a passive pullup is supplied by the backplane. Bus Want/Clear (/GBG) := ( /BCLR ) for Zorro III This signal is asserted by the bus controller to indicate that a PIC wants to master the bus. A bus master assumes that the host CPU wants the bus, and that any time wasted as master is stealing time from the CPU. To avoid such waste, a master should use cache or FIFO to grab slow-coming data, and then transfer it all at once. /BCLR is asserted to indicate that additionally, another PIC wants the bus, and the current bus master should get off as soon as possible. This signal is equivalent to /GBG on the A2000 bus. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
