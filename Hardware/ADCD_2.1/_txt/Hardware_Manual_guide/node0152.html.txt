TITLE: F / / Interface Signals / IRQ - interrupt request output

F / / Interface Signals / IRQ - interrupt request output ]" border=0> IRQ is an open drain output normally connected to the processor interrupt input. An external pull-up resistor holds the signal high, allowing multiple IRQ outputs to be connected together. The IRQ output is normally off (high impedance) and is activated low as indicated in the functional description. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
