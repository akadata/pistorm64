F / Control Registers / Control Register B ]" border=0> CONTROL REGISTER B: BIT NAME FUNCTION --- ---- -------- 0 START 1 = start Timer B, 0 = stop Timer B. This bit is automatically reset (= 0) when underflow occurs during one-shot mode. 1 PBON 1 = Timer B output on PB7, 0 = PB7 is normal operation. 2 OUTMODE 1 = toggle, 0 = pulse. 3 RUNMODE 1 = one-shot mode, 0 = continuous mode. 4 LOAD 1 = force load (this is a strobe input, there is no data storage; bit 4 will always read back a zero and writing a 0 has no effect.) 6,5 INMODE Bits CRB6 and CRB5 select one of four possible input modes for Timer B, as follows: CRB6 CRB5 Mode Selected ---- ---- --------------------------------------- 0 0 Timer B counts 02 pulses 0 1 Timer B counts positive CNT transitions 1 0 Timer B counts Timer A underflow pulses 1 1 Timer B counts Timer A underflow pulses while CNT pin is held high. 7 ALARM 1 = writing to TOD registers sets Alarm 0 = writing to TOD registers sets TOD clock. Reading TOD registers always reads TOD clock, regardless of the state of the Alarm bit. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
