TITLE: 4 / Forming a Sprite / Size of Sprites

4 / Forming a Sprite / Size of Sprites ]" border=0> Sprites are 16 pixels wide and can be almost any height you wish -- as short as one line or taller than the screen. You would probably move a very tall sprite vertically to display a portion of it at a time. Sprite size is based on a pixel that is 1/320th of a screen's width, 1/200th of a NTSC screen's height, or 1/256 of a PAL screen's height. This pixel size corresponds to the low resolution and non-interlaced modes of the normal full-size playfield. Sprites, however, are independent of playfield modes of display, so changing the resolution or interlace mode of the playfield has no effect on the size or resolution of a sprite.
