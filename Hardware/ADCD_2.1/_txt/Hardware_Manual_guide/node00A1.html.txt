C Enhanced Chip Set / ECS Hardware and the Graphics Library ]" border=0> The Enhanced Chip Set consists of compatible revisions to the Agnus and Denise custom chips. The V36 graphics.library software makes it possible for these chips to display images in new resolutions, at new monitor scan rates and with new sprite and genlock abilities. With the enhanced Agnus, the V36 graphics.library supports the new programmable scan rate registers to provide multi-sync and bi-sync monitor capability. The new SuperHires mode provides 35ns pixel rates and sprite positioning at 70ns rates. Support for big blits (up to 32k x 32k) is provided for all graphics functions if the ECS Agnus is present. With the enhanced Denise, the V36 graphics.library provides display window start and stop with explicit control over larger ranges than was possible before. There are new color register interpretations as part of the SuperHires mode. Genlock control has been expanded for more flexibility. Borders may be explicitly transparent or opaque, color registers other than zero can control video overlay and a bitplane mask may be used for special-purpose video masking concurrently with the other genlock features. Warning: -------- With these new features come certain new responsibilities when using the graphics.library.
