8 / / Timing / ADKCON and ADKCONR - Audio and Disk Control Register ]" border=0> ADKCON is the write-only address and ADKCONR is the read-only address for this register. Not all of the bits are dedicated to the disk. Bit 15 of this register allows independent setting or clearing of any bit or bits. If bit 15 is a one on a write, any ones in positions 0-14 will set the corresponding bit. If bit 15 is a zero, any ones will clear the corresponding bit. Table 8-8: ADKCON and ADKCONR Register Bit Number Name Function ------ ---- -------- 15 SET/CLR Control bit that allows setting or clearing of individual bits without affecting the rest of the register. If bit 15 is a 1, the specified bits are set. If bit 15 is a 0, the specified bits are cleared. 14 PRECOMP1 MSB of Precompensation specifier 13 PRECOMP0 LSB of Precompensation specifier Value of 00 selects none. Value of 01 selects 140 ns. Value of 10 selects 280 ns. Value of 11 selects 560 ns. 12 MFMPREC Value of 0 selects GCR Precompensation. Value of 1 selects MFM Precompensation. 10 WORDSYNC Value of 1 enables synchronizing and starting of DMA on disk read of a word. The word on which to synchronize must be written into the DSKSYNC address ($DFF07E). This capability is highly useful. 9 MSBSYNC Value of 1 enables sync on most significant bit of the input (usually used for GCR). 8 FAST Value of 1 selects two microseconds per bit cell (usually MFM). Data must be valid raw MFM. 0 selects four microseconds per bit (usually GCR). 7-0 These bits are used by the audio subsystem for volume and frequency modulation. The raw MFM data that must be presented to the disk controller will be twice as large as the unencoded data. The following table shows the relationship: 1 -> 01 0 -> 10 ;if following a 0 0 -> 00 ;if following a 1 With clever manipulation, the blitter can be used to encode and decode the MFM. In one common form of GCR recording, each data byte always has the most significant bit set to a 1. MSBSYNC, when a 1, tells the disk controller to look for this sync bit on every disk byte. When reading a GCR formatted disk, the software must use a translate table called a nybble-izer to assure that data written to the disk does not have too many consecutive 1's or 0's.
