5 Audio Hardware / The Audio State Machine ]" border=0> For an explanation of the various states, refer to Figure 5-8. There is one audio state machine for each channel. The machine has eight states and is clocked at the clock constant rate (3.58 MHz NTSC). Three of the states are basically unused and just transfer back to the idle (000) state. One of the paths out of the idle state is designed for interrupt-driven operation (processor provides the data), and the other path is designed for DMA-driven operation (the "Agnus" special chip provides the data). In interrupt-driven operation, transfer to the main loop (states 010 and 011) occurs immediately after data is written by the processor. In the 010 state the upper byte is output, and in the 011 state the lower byte is output. Transitions such as 010->011->010 occur whenever the period counter counts down to one. The period counter is reloaded at these transitions. As long as the interrupt is cleared by the processor in time, the machine remains in the main loop. Otherwise, it enters the idle state. Interrupts are generated on every word transition (011->010). In DMA-driven operation, transition to the 001 state occurs and DMA requests are sent to Agnus as soon as DMA is turned on. Because of pipelining in Agnus, the first data word must be thrown away. State 101 is entered as soon as this word arrives; a request for the next data word has already gone out. When the data arrives, state 010 is entered and the main loop continues until the DMA is turned off. The length counter counts down once with each word that comes in. When it finishes, a DMA restart request goes to Agnus along with the regular DMA request. This tells Agnus to reset the pointer to the beginning of the table of data. Also, the length counter is reloaded and an interrupt request goes out soon after the length counter finishes (counts to one). The request goes out just as the last word of the waveform starts its output. DMA requests and restart requests are transferred to Agnus once each horizontal line, and the data comes back about 14 clock cycles later (the duration of a clock cycle is 280 ns). In attach mode, things run a little differently. In attach volume, requests occur as they do in normal operation (on the 011->010 transition). In attach period, a set of requests occurs on the 010->011 transition. When both attach period and attach volume are high, requests occur on both transitions. If the sampling rate is set much higher than the normal maximum sampling rate (approximately 29 KHz), the two samples in the buffer register will be repeated. If the filter on the Amiga is bypassed and the volume is set to the maximum ($40), this feature can be used to make modulated carriers up to 1.79 MHz. The modulation is placed in the memory map, with plus values in the even bytes and minus values in the odd bytes. The symbols used in the state diagram are explained in the following list. Upper-case names indicate external signals; lower-case names indicate local signals. AUDxON DMA on "x" indicates channel number (signal from DMACON ). AUDxIP Audio interrupt pending (input to channel from interrupt circuitry). AUDxIR Audio interrupt request (output from channel to interrupt circuitry) intreq1 Interrupt request that combines with intreq2 to form AUDxIR.. intreq2 Prepare for interrupt request. Request comes out after the next 011->010 transition in normal operation. AUDxDAT Audio data load signal. Loads 16 bits of data to audio channel. AUDxDR Audio DMA request to Agnus for one word of data. AUDxDSR Audio DMA request to Agnus to reset pointer to start of block. dmasen Restart request enable. percntrld Reload period counter from back-up latch typically written by processor with AUDxPER (can also be written by attach mode). percount Count period counter down one latch. perfin Period counter finished (value = 1). lencntrld Reload length counter from back-up latch. lencount Count length counter down one notch. lenfin Length counter finished (value = 1). volcntrld Reload volume counter from back-up latch. pbufld1 Load output buffer from holding latch written to by AUDxDAT. pbufld2 Like pbufld1, but only during 010->011 with attach period. AUDxAV Attach volume. Send data to volume latch of next channel instead of to D->A converter. AUDxAP Attach period. Send data to period latch of next channel instead of to the D->A converter. penhi Enable the high 8 bits of data to go to the D->A converter. napnav /AUDxAV * /AUDxAP + AUDxAV -- no attach stuff or else attach volume. Condition for normal DMA and interrupt requests. sq2,1,0 The name of the state flip-flops, MSB to LSB.
