TITLE: 5 / / Selecting the Data Output Rate / Specifying the Period Value

5 / / Selecting the Data Output Rate / Specifying the Period Value ]" border=0> After you have selected the desired interval between data samples, you can calculate the value to place in the period register by using the period formula: desired interval clock constant Period value = ---------------- = ------------------ clock interval samples per second As an example, say you wanted to produce a 1 KHz sine wave, using a table of eight data samples (four data words) (see Figure 5-3). Figure 5-3: Example Sine Wave Sampled Values: 0 90 127 90 0 -90 -127 -90 To output the series of eight samples at 1 KHz (1,000 cycles per second), each full cycle is output in 1/1000th of a second. Therefore, each individual value must be retrieved in 1/8th of that time. This translates to 1,000 microseconds per waveform or 125 microseconds per sample. To correctly produce this waveform, the period value should be: 125 microseconds/sample Period value = ------------------------------ = 447 timing 0.279365 microseconds/interval intervals/sample To set the period register, you must write the period value into the register AUDxPER, where "x" is the number of the channel you are using. For example, the following instruction shows how to write a period value of 447 into the period register for channel 0. SETAUD0PERIOD: LEA CUSTOM,a0 MOVE.W #447,AUD0PER(a0) To produce high-quality sound, avoiding aliasing distortion , you should observe the limitations on period values that are discussed in the section called "Producing Quality Sound." For the relationship between period and musical pitch, see the section at the end of the chapter, which contains a listing of the equal-tempered musical scale . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
