TITLE: 5 / Producing High-quality Sound / Noise Reduction

5 / Producing High-quality Sound / Noise Reduction ]" border=0> To reduce noise levels and produce an accurate sound, try to use the full range of -128 to 127 when you represent a waveform. This reduces how much noise (quantization error) will be added to the signal by using more bits of precision. Quantization noise is caused by the introduction of round-off error. If you are trying to reproduce a signal, such as a sine wave, you can represent the amplitude of each sample with only so many digits of accuracy. The difference between the real number and your approximation is round-off error, or noise. By doubling the amplitude , you create half as much noise because the size of the steps of the wave form stays the same and is therefore a smaller fraction of the amplitude. In other words, if you try to represent a waveform using, for example, a range of only +3 to -3, the size of the error in the output would be considerably larger than if you use a range of +127 to -128 to represent the same signal. Proportionally, the digital value used to represent the waveform amplitude will have a lower error. As you increase the number of possible sample levels, you decrease the relative size of each step and, therefore, decrease the size of the error. To produce quiet sounds, continue to define the waveform using the full range, but adjust the volume . This maintains the same level of accuracy (signal-to-noise ratio) for quiet sounds as for loud sounds. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
