5 / Introducing Sound Generation / The Amiga Sound Hardware ]" border=0> The Amiga has four hardware sound channels. You can independently program each of the channels to produce complex sound effects. You can also attach channels so that one channel modulates the sound of another or combine two channels for stereo effects. Each audio channel includes an eight-bit digital-to-analog converter driven by a direct memory access (DMA) channel. The audio DMA can retrieve two data samples during each horizontal video scan line. For simple, steady tones, the DMA can automatically play a waveform repeatedly; you can also program all kinds of complex sound effects. There are two methods of basic sound production on the Amiga -- automatic (DMA) sound generation and direct (non-DMA) sound generation. When you use automatic sound generation, the system retrieves data automatically by direct memory access. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
