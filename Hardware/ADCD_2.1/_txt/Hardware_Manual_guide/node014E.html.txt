F / / Interface Signals / CS - chip-select input ]" border=0> The CS input controls the activity of the 8520. A low level on CS while 02 is high causes the device to respond to signals on the R/W and address ( RS ) lines. A high on CS prevents these lines from controlling the 8520. The CS line is normally activated (low) at 02 by the appropriate address combination. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
