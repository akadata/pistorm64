TITLE: G Keyboard Interface / Power-Up Sequence

G Keyboard Interface / Power-Up Sequence ]" border=0> There are two possible ways for the keyboard to be powered up under normal circumstances: the computer can be turned on with the keyboard plugged in, or the keyboard can be plugged into an already "on" computer. The keyboard and computer must handle either case without causing any upset. The first thing the keyboard does on power-up is to perform a self-test. This involves a ROM checksum test, simple RAM test, and watchdog timer test. Whenever the keyboard is powered up (or restarted -- see below), it must not transmit anything until it has achieved synchronization with the computer. The way it does this is by slowly clocking out 1 bits , as described above, until it receives a handshake pulse. If the keyboard is plugged in before power-up, the keyboard may continue this process for several minutes as the computer struggles to boot up and get running. The keyboard must continue clocking out 1s for however long is necessary, until it receives its handshake. If the keyboard is plugged in after power-up, no more than eight clocks will be needed to achieve sync. In this case, however, the computer may be in any state imaginable but must not be adversely affected by the garbage character it will receive. Again, because it receives a key release, the damage should be minimal. The keyboard driver must anticipate this happening and handle it, as should any application that uses raw keycodes. Warning: -------- The keyboard must not transmit a " lost sync " code after re-synchronizing due to a power-up or restart ; only after re-synchronizing due to a handshake time-out. Once the keyboard and computer are in sync, the keyboard must inform the computer of the results of the self-test. If the self-test failed for any reason, a "selftest failed" code (value $FC = 11111100) is transmitted (the keyboard does not wait for a handshake pulse after sending the "selftest failed" code). After this, the keyboard processor goes into a loop in which it blinks the Caps Lock LED to inform the user of the failure. The blinks are coded as bursts of one, two, three, or four blinks, approximately one burst per second: One blink ROM checksum failure. Two blinks RAM test failed. Three blinks Watchdog timer test failed. Four blinks A short exists between two row lines or one of the seven special keys (not implemented). If the self-test succeeds, then the keyboard will proceed to transmit any keys that are currently down. First, it sends an "initiate power-up key stream" code (value $FD = 11111101), followed by the key codes of all depressed keys (with keyup/down set to "down" for each key). After all keys are sent (usually there won't be any at all), a "terminate key stream" code (value $FE = 11111110) is sent. Finally, the Caps Lock LED is shut off. This marks the end of the start-up sequence, and normal processing commences. The usual sequence of events will therefore be: power-up; synchronize; transmit "initiate power-up key stream" ($FD); transmit "terminate key stream" ($FE). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
