3 / Dual-playfield / Bitplane Assignment in Dual-Playfield Mode ]" border=0> The three odd-numbered bitplanes (1, 3, and 5) are grouped together by the hardware and may be used in playfield 1. Likewise, the three even-numbered bitplanes (2, 4, and 6) are grouped together and may be used in playfield 2. The bitplanes are assigned alternately to each playfield, as shown in Figure 3-13. About dual-playfield bitplanes. ------------------------------- In high resolution mode, you can have up to two bitplanes in each playfield -- bitplanes 1 and 3 in playfield 1 and bitplanes 2 and 4 in playfield 2.
