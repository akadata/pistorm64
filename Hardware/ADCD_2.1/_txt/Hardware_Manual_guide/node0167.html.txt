7 / / Setting and Clearing Bits / Master Interrupt Enable ]" border=0> Bit 14 of the interrupt registers (INTEN) is for interrupt enable. This is the master interrupt enable bit. If this bit is a 0, it disables all other interrupts. You may wish to clear this bit to temporarily disable all interrupts to do some critical processing task. Warning: -------- This bit is used for enable/disable only. It creates no interrupt request. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
