E / / External Disk Interface Specification / Pin Assignment (J7) ]" border=0> PIN NAME DIR NOTES --- ---- --- ----- 1 RDY* I/O If motor on, indicates disk installed and up to speed. If motor not on, identification mode . See below. 2 DKRD* I MFM input data to Amiga. 3 GND 4 GND 5 GND 6 GND 7 GND 8 MTRXD* OC Motor on data, clocked into drive's motor-on flip-flop by the active transition of SELxB*. Guaranteed setup time is 1.4 usec. Guaranteed hold time is 1.4 usec. 9 SEL2B* OC Select drive 2.* 10 DRESB* OC Amiga system reset. Drives should reset their motor-on flip-flops and set their write-protect flip-flops. 11 CHNG* I/O Note: Nominally used as an open collector input. Drive's change flop is set at power up or when no disk is not installed. Flop is reset when drive is selected and the head stepped, but only if a disk is installed. 12 +5V 270 ma maximum; 410 ma surge When below 3.75V, drives are required to reset their motor-on flops, and set their write-protect flops. 13 SIDEB* O Side 1 if active, side 0 if inactive 14 WPRO* I/O Asserted by selected, write-protected disk. 15 TK0* I/O Asserted by selected drive when read/write head is positioned over track 0. 16 DKWEB* OC Write gate (enable) to drive. 17 DKWDB* OC MFM output data from Amiga. 18 STEPB* OC Selected drive steps one cylinder in the direction indicated by DIRB. 19 DIRB OC Direction to step the head. Inactive to step towards center of disk (higher-numbered tracks). 20 SEL3B* OC Select drive 3. * 21 SEL1B* OC Select drive 1. * 22 INDEX* I/O Index is a pulse generated once per disk revolution, between the end and beginning of cylinders. The 8520 can be programmed to conditionally generate a level 6 interrupt to the 680x0 whenever the INDEX* input goes active. 23 +12V 160 ma maximum; 540 ma surge. * Note: the drive select lines are shifted as they pass through a string of daisy chained devices. Thus the signal that appears as drive 2 select at the first drive shows up as drive 1 select at the second drive and so on... [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
