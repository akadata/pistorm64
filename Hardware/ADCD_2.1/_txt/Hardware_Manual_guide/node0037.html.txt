A Register Summary / INTREQ, INTREQR ]" border=0> Agnus/ Read/ Denise/ Register Address Write Paula Function -------- ------- ----- ------- -------- INTREQ 09C W P Interrupt request bits (clear or set) INTREQR 01E R P Interrupt request bits (read) This register contains interrupt request bits (or flags). These bits may be polled by the processor; if enabled by the bits listed in the above register, they may cause processor interrupts. Both a set and clear operation are required to load arbitrary data into this register. These status bits are not automatically reset when the interrupt is serviced, and must be reset when desired by writing to this address. The bit assignments are identical to the enable register .
