3 / / Correct Coloring / A Playfield of Three or More Colors ]" border=0> For three or more colors, you need more than one bitplane. The task here is to define each bitplane in such a way that when they are combined for display, each pixel contains the correct combination of bits. This is a little more complicated than a playfield of one bitplane. The following examples show a four-color playfield, but the basic idea and procedures are the same for playfields containing up to 32 colors. Figure 3-8 shows two bitplanes forming a four-color playfield: Image in Results in a display bitplane 2 _____ similar to this: | | +---------------- 0 1 | Color 1 -------+ | |___ _| | | | | | | | +---+ +---+ | 0 0 0|0 0|0 0 0 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 *** | | | | *** 0 0 0|0 0|0 0 0 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 *** | | | | *** 0 0 0|0 0|0 0 0 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 *** +---+ +---+ *** 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 ······ ······ ······ ······ 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 ······ \······ +---+ +---+ ···\ 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 ··· \ | | | | ··· \ 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 ··· \__ Color 00 | | | | ··· (background) 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 0 0 0|1 1|0 0 0 ··· +---+ +---+ | | | | | ___|_ | | | | | +---------------- 1 1 | Color 3 -------+ |_____| Figure 3-8: Combining Bitplanes You place the correct "1"s and "0"s in both bitplanes to give each pixel in the picture above the correct color. In a single playfield you can combine up to five bitplanes in this way. Using five bitplanes allows a choice of 32 different colors for any single pixel. The playfield color selection charts at the end of this chapter summarize the bit combinations for playfields made from four and five bitplanes. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
