TITLE: 5 / Producing Complex Sounds / Playing Multiple Tones at the Same Time

5 / Producing Complex Sounds / Playing Multiple Tones at the Same Time ]" border=0> You can play multiple tones either by using several channels independently or by summing the samples in several data sets, playing the summed data sets through a single channel. Since all four audio channels are independently programmable, each channel has its own data set; thus a different tone or musical note can be played on each channel. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
