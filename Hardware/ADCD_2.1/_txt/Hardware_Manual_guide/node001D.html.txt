Writing to this register will start the blitter, and should be done last, after all pointers and control registers have been initialized.

The h field LINE DRAW controls the line length (10 bits gives LINE DRAW lines up to 1024 dots long). The w field LINE DRAW must be set to 02 for all line drawing.
