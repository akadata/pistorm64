G Keyboard Interface / Caps Lock Key ]" border=0> This key is different from all the others in that it generates a keycode only when it is pushed down, never when it is released. However, the up/down bit is still used. When pushing the Caps Lock key turns on the Caps Lock LED, the up/down bit will be 0; when pushing Caps Lock shuts off the LED, the up/down bit will be 1.
