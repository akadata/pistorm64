TITLE: 6 Blitter Hardware / Descending Mode

6 Blitter Hardware / Descending Mode ]" border=0> Our standard memory copy blit works fine if the source does not overlap the destination. If we want to move an image one row down (towards increasing addresses), however, we run into a problem -- we overwrite the second row before we get a chance to copy it! The blitter has a special mode of operation -- descending mode -- that solves this problem nicely. Descending mode is turned on by setting bit one of BLTCON1 (defined as BLITREVERSE). If you use descending mode the address pointers will be decremented by two (bytes) instead of incremented by two for each word fetched. In addition, the modulo values will be subtracted rather than added. Shifts are then towards the left, rather than the right, the first word mask masks the last word in a row (which is still the first word fetched), and the last word mask masks the first word in a row. Thus, for a standard memory copy, the only difference in blitter setup (assuming no shifting or masking ) is to initialize the address pointer registers to point to the last word in a block, rather than the first word. The modulo values , blit size , and all other parameters should be set the same. NOTE: ----- This differs from predecrement versus postincrement in the 680x0, where an address register would be initialized to point to the word after the last, rather than the last word. Descending mode is also necessary for area filling , which will be covered in a later section. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
