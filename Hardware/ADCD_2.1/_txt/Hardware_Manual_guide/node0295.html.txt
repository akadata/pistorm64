TITLE: K / / Changes from A2000 Bus / Zorro II Master Access to Local Slaves

K / / Changes from A2000 Bus / Zorro II Master Access to Local Slaves ]" border=0> The only supported local bus resource that's guaranteed accessible to a Zorro II expansion bus master as a slave device is chip bus memory. All I/O devices are implementation dependent and not supportable via DMA. Any attempted access to unsupported local bus resources as expansion slaves will result in an error condition being signaled on both the local and the expansion buses. Most other local bus resources, such as local bus fast memory, are located outside of Zorro II space on most systems and obviously not available to Zorro II masters. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
