TITLE: 5 Audio Hardware / Introducing Sound Generation

5 Audio Hardware / Introducing Sound Generation ]" border=0> Sound travels through air to your ear drums as a repeated cycle of air pressure variations, or sound waves. Sounds can be represented as graphs that model how the air pressure varies over time. The attributes of a sound, as you hear it, are related to the shape of the graph. If the waveform is regular and repetitive, it will sound like a tone with steady pitch (highness or lowness), such as a single musical note. Each repetition of a waveform is called a cycle of the sound. If the waveform is irregular, the sound will have little or no pitch, like a loud clash or rushing water. How often the waveform repeats (its frequency) has an effect upon its pitch; sounds with higher frequencies are higher in pitch. Humans can hear sounds that have a frequency of between 20 and 20,000 cycles per second. The amplitude of the waveform (highest point on the graph), is related to the perceived loudness of the sound. Finally, the general shape of the waveform determines its tone quality, or timbre. Figure 5-1 shows a particular kind of waveform, called a sine wave, that represents one cycle of a simple tone. Figure 5-1: Sine Waveform In electronic sound recording and output devices, the attributes of sounds are represented by the parameters of amplitude and frequency. Frequency is the number of cycles per second, and the most common unit of frequency is the Hertz (Hz), which is 1 cycle per second. Large values, or high frequencies, are measured in kilohertz (KHz) or megahertz (MHz). Frequency is strongly related to the perceived pitch of a sound. When frequency increases, pitch rises. This relationship is exponential. An increase from 100 Hz to 200 Hz results in a large rise in pitch, but an increase from 1,000 Hz to 1,100 Hz is hardly noticeable. Musical pitch is represented in octaves. A tone that is one octave higher than another has a frequency twice as high as that of the first tone, and its perceived pitch is twice as high. The second parameter that defines a waveform is its amplitude. In an electronic circuit, amplitude relates to the voltage or current in the circuit. When a signal is going to a speaker, the amplitude is expressed in watts. Perceived sound intensity is measured in decibels (db). Human hearing has a range of about 120 db; 1 db is the faintest audible sound. Roughly every 10 db corresponds to a doubling of sound, and 1 db is the smallest change in amplitude that is noticeable in a moderately loud sound. Volume, which is the amplitude of the sound signal which is output, corresponds logarithmically to decibel level. The frequency and amplitude parameters of a sine wave are completely independent. When sound is heard, however, there is interaction between loudness and pitch. Lower-frequency sounds decrease in loudness much faster than high-frequency sounds. The third attribute of a sound, timbre, depends on the presence or absence of overtones, or harmonics. Any complex waveform is actually a mixture of sine waves of different amplitudes, frequencies, and phases (the starting point of the waveform on the time axis). These component sine waves are called harmonics. A square waveform, for example, has an infinite number of harmonics. In summary, all steady sounds can be described by their frequency, overall amplitude, and relative harmonic amplitudes. The audible equivalents of these parameters are pitch, loudness, and timbre, respectively. Changing sound is a steady sound whose parameters change over time. In electronic production of sound, an analog device, such as a tape recorder, records sound waveforms and their cycle frequencies as a continuously variable representation of air pressure. The tape recorder then plays back the sound by sending the waveforms to an amplifier where they are changed into analog voltage waveforms. The amplifier sends the voltage waveforms to a loudspeaker, which translates them into air pressure vibrations that the listener perceives as sound. A computer cannot store analog waveform information. In computer production of sound, a waveform has to be represented as a finite string of numbers. This transformation is made by dividing the time axis of the graph of a single waveform into equal segments, each of which represents a short enough time so the waveform does not change a great deal. Each of the resulting points is called a sample. These samples are stored in memory, and you can play them back at a frequency that you determine. The computer feeds the samples to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which changes them into an analog voltage waveform. To produce the sound, the analog waveforms are sent first to an amplifier, then to a loudspeaker. Figure 5-2 shows an example of a sine wave, a square wave, and a triangle wave, along with a table of samples for each.

The amplitude axis values 127 and -128 represent the high and low limits on relative amplitude. The Amiga Sound Hardware [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
