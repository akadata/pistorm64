TITLE: 8 / / Disk Subsystem Timing / DSKLEN - Length, Direction, DMA Enable

8 / / Disk Subsystem Timing / DSKLEN - Length, Direction, DMA Enable ]" border=0> All of the control bits relating to this topic are contained in a write-only register, called DSKLEN: Table 8-6: DSKLEN Register ($DFF024) Bit Number Name Usage ------ ---- ----- 15 DMAEN Secondary disk DMA enable 14 WRITE Disk write (RAM -> disk if 1) 13-0 LENGTH Number of words to transfer The hardware requires a special sequence in order to start DMA to the disk. This sequence prevents accidental writes to the disk. In short, the DMAEN bit in the DSKLEN register must be turned on twice in order to actually enable the disk DMA hardware. Here is the sequence you should follow: 1. Enable disk DMA in the DMACON register (See Chapter 7 for more information) 2. Set DSKLEN to $4000, thereby forcing the DMA for the disk to be turned off. 3. Put the value you want into the DSKLEN register. 4. Write this value again into the DSKLEN register. This actually starts the DMA. 5. After the DMA is complete, set the DSKLEN register back to $4000, to prevent accidental writes to the disk. As each data word is transferred, the length value is decremented. After each transfer occurs, the value of the pointer is incremented. The pointer points to the the next word of data to written or read. When the length value counts down to 0, the transfer stops. The recommended method of reading from the disk is to read an entire track into a buffer and then search for the sector(s) that you want. Using the DSKSYNC register (described below) will guarantee word alignment of the data. With this process you need to read from the disk only once for the entire track. In a high speed loader, the step to the next head can occur while the previous track is processed and checksummed. With this method there are no time-critical sections in reading data, other high-priority subsystems (such as graphics or audio) are be allowed to run. If you have too little memory for track buffering (or for some other reason decide not to read a whole track at once), the disk hardware supports a limited set of sector-searching facilities. There is a register that may be polled to examine the disk input stream. There is a hardware bug that causes the last three bits of data sent to the disk to be lost. Also, the last word in a disk-read DMA operation may not come in (that is, one less word may be read than you asked for). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
