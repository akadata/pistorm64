A Register Summary / SERDAT, SERDATR ]" border=0> Agnus/ Read/ Denise/ Register Address Write Paula Function -------- ------- ----- ------- -------- SERDAT 030 W P Serial port data and stop bits write (transmit data buffer) This address writes data to a transmit data buffer. Data from this buffer is moved into a serial shift register for output transmission whenever it is empty. This sets the interrupt request TBE (transmit buffer empty). A stop bit must be provided as part of the data word. The length of the data word is set by the position of the stop bit. BIT# 15,14,13,12,11,10,09,08,07,06,05,04,03,02,01,00 ----------------------------------------------- USE 0 0 0 0 0 0 S D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 Note: S = stop bit = 1, D = data bits. SERDATR 018 R P Serial port data and status read (receive data buffer) This address reads data from a receive data buffer. Data in this buffer is loaded from a receiving shift register whenever it is full. Several interrupt request bits are also read at this address, along with the data, as shown below. BIT# SYM FUNCTION ---- ---- ----------------------- 15 OVRUN Serial port receiver overrun. Reset by resetting bit 11 of INTREQ . 14 RBF Serial port receive buffer full (mirror). 13 TBE Serial port transmit buffer empty (mirror). 12 TSRE Serial port transmit shift register empty. Reset by loading into buffer. 11 RXD RXD pin receives UART serial data for direct bit test by the microprocessor. 10 0 Not used 09 STP Stop bit 08 STP-DB8 Stop bit if LONG, data bit if not. 07 DB7 Data bit 06 DB6 Data bit 05 DB5 Data bit 04 DB4 Data bit 03 DB3 Data bit 02 DB2 Data bit 01 DB1 Data bit 00 DB0 Data bit [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
