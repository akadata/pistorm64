4 / / Building the Data Structure / End-of-data Words ]" border=0> When the vertical position of the beam counter is equal to the VSTOP value in the sprite control words , the next two words fetched from the sprite data structure are written into the sprite control registers instead of being sent to the color registers . These two words are interpreted by the hardware in the same manner as the original words that were first loaded into the control registers . If the VSTART value contained in these words is lower than the current beam position, this sprite will not be reused in this display field. For consistency, the value 0 should be used for both words when ending the usage of a sprite. Sprite reuse is discussed later. The following data structure is for the spaceship sprite. It will be located at V = 65 and H = 128 on the normally visible part of the screen.
