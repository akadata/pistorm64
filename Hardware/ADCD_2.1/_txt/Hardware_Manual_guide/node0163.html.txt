7 / Interrupts / User Interface to the Interrupt System ]" border=0> The system software has been designed to correctly handle all system hardware interrupts at levels 1 through 6. A separate set of input lines, designated INT2* and INT6* have been routed to the expansion connector for use by external hardware for interrupts. These are known as the external low- and external high-level interrupts. These interrupt lines are connected to the peripherals chip and create interrupt levels 2 and 6 , respectively. It is recommended that you take advantage of the interrupt handlers built into the operating system by using these external interrupt lines rather than generating interrupts directly on the processor interrupt lines.
