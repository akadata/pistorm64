E / Explanation of I/O Connectors / Game Controller Interface Spec ]" border=0> The two 9-pin D-type connectors with pins (male) are used to interface to four types of devices: 1. Mouse or trackball, 3 buttons max. 2. Digital joystick, 2 buttons max. 3. Proportional (pot or proportional joystick), 2 buttons max. 4. Light pen, including pen-pressed-to-screen button. The connector pin assignments are discussed in sections organized by similar hardware and/or software operating requirements as shown in the previous list. Signal names follow those used elsewhere in this appendix, when possible. J11 is the right controller port connector ( JOY1DAT , POT1DAT ). J12 is the left controller port connector ( JOY0DAT , POT0DAT ). NOTE: ----- While most of the hardware discussed below is directly accessible, hardware should be accessed through ROM kernel software. This will keep future hardware changes transparent to the user.
