1 Introduction / About the Examples ]" border=0> The examples in this book all demonstrate direct manipulation of the Amiga hardware. However, as a general rule, it is not permissible to directly access the hardware in the Amiga unless your software either has full control of the system, or has arbitrated via the OS for exclusive access to the particular parts of the hardware you wish to control. Almost all of the hardware discussed in this manual, most notably the Blitter, Copper, playfield, sprite, CIA, trackdisk, and system control hardware, are in either exclusive or arbitrated use by portions of the Amiga OS in any running Amiga system. Additional hardware, such as the audio, parallel, and serial hardware, may be in use by applications which have allocated their use through the system software. Before attempting to directly manipulate any part of the hardware in the Amiga's multitasking environment, your application must first be granted exclusive access to that hardware by the operating system library, device, or resource which arbitrates its ownership. The operating system functions for requesting and receiving control of parts of the Amiga hardware are varied and are not within the scope of this manual. Generally such functions, when available, will be found in the library, device, or resource which manages that portion of the Amiga hardware in the multitasking environment. The following list will help you to find the appropriate operating system functions or mechanisms which may exist for arbitrated access to the hardware discussed in this manual. Hardware component Amiga system module that controls it ------------------ ------------------------------------ Copper, Playfield, Sprite, Blitter................graphics.library Audio.................................................audio.device Trackdisk..........................trackdisk.device, disk.resource Serial................................serial.device, misc.resource Parallel..............parallel.device, cia.resource, misc.resource Gameport.............input.device, gameport.device, potgo.resource Keyboard.............................input.device, keyboard.device System Control.........graphics.library, exec.library (interrupts) Most of the examples in this book use the hw_examples.i file (see Appendix I ) to define the chip register names. Hw_examples.i uses the system include file hardware/custom.i to define the chip structures and relative addresses. The values defined in hardware/custom.i and hw_examples.i are offsets from the base of the chip register address space. In general, this base value is defined as _custom and is resolved during linking with the linker library amiga.lib. (_ciaa and _ciab are also resolved in this way.) Normally, the base address is loaded into an address register and the offsets given by hardware/custom.i and hw_examples.i are then used to access the correct register. (One exception to this rule is the Copper which uses only the offset access the registers.) For example, in assembler: INCLUDE "exec/types.i" INCLUDE "hardware/custom.i" XREF _custom ; External reference... Start: lea _custom,a0 ; Use a0 as base register and move.w #$7FFF,intena(a0) ; use the name intena as an offset ; to disable all interrupts In C, you would use the structure definitions in hardware/custom.h For example: #include "exec/types.h" #include "hardware/custom.h" extern struct Custom custom; /* You may need to define the above external as ** extern struct Custom far custom; ** Check you compiler manual. */ main() { custom.intena = 0x7FFF; /* Disable all interrupts */ } The Amiga hardware include files are generally supplied with your compiler or assembler. Listings of the hardware include files may also be found in the Amiga ROM Kernel Manual: Includes and Autodocs. Generally, the include file label names are very similar to the equivalent hardware register list names with the following typical differences. * Address registers which have low word and high word components are generally listed as two word sized registers in the hardware register list, with each register name containing either a suffix or embedded "L" or "H" for low and high. The include file label for the same register will generally treat the whole register as a longword (32 bit) register, and therefore will not contain the "L" or "H" distinction. * Related sequential registers which are given individual names with number suffixes in the hardware register list, are generally referenced from a single base register definition in the include files. For example, the color registers in the hardware list (COLOR00, COLOR01, etc.) would be referenced from the "color" label defined in hardware/custom.i (color+0, color+2, etc.). * Examples of how to define the correct register offset can be found in the hw_examples.i file listed in Appendix I . Except as noted, 68000 assembly language examples have been assembled under the Innovatronics CAPE assembler V2.x, the HiSoft Devpac assembler V1.2, and the Lake Forest Logic ADAPT assembler 1.0. No substantial changes should be required to switch between assemblers. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
