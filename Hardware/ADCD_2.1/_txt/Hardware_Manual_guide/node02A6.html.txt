TITLE: K / / Basic Zorro III Bus Cycles / Simple Bus Cycle Operation

K / / Basic Zorro III Bus Cycles / Simple Bus Cycle Operation ]" border=0> The normal Zorro III bus cycle is quite different than the Zorro II bus in many respects. Figure K-5 shows the basic cycle. There is no bus clock visible on the expansion bus; the standard Zorro II clocks are still active during Zorro III cycles, but they have no relationship to the Zorro II bus cycle. Every bus event is based on a relationship to a particular bus strobe, and strobes are alternately supplied by master and slave. ______ READ CYCLE ______ WRITE CYCLE ____ /FCS \ / \ / \___________________/ \____________________/ address data from slave address data from master _|_ ___________|___ _|_ _____|_______ AD31..AD8 _____/ | \____/ / | \___/ | \____/ | \_____ \___/ \________\______/ \___/ \_____________/ _______________________ _______________________ SA7..SA2 _____/ \____/ \____ FC2..FC0 \_______________________/ \_______________________/ __________________________________ ____ READ / \ / ___/ \_____________________/ ___________ __________ ____ /SLAVE \ / \ / \_______________/ \_______________/ ______________ ______________ DOE / \ / \ ____________/ \___________/ \____ _______________ ______________ ____ /DS3../DS0 \ / \ / \___________/ \___________/ _____________________ ____________________ ____ \ / \ / /DTACK \_____/ \_____/ Figure K-5: Basic Zorro III Cycles A Zorro III cycle begins when the bus master simultaneously drives addressing information on the address bus and memory space codes on the FCn lines, quickly following that with the assertion of the Full Cycle Strobe, /FCS ; this is called the address phase of the bus. Any active slaves will latch the bus address on the falling edge of /FCS , and the bus master will tri-state the addressing information very shortly after /FCS is asserted. It's necessary only to latch A31-A8 ; the low order A7-A2 addresses and @" FCn " link K-4-6 28} codes are non-multiplexed. As quickly as possible after /FCS is asserted, a slave device will respond to the bus address by asserting its /SLAVEn line, and possibly other special-purpose signals. The autoconfiguration process assigns a unique address range to each PIC base on its needs, just as on the Zorro II bus. Only one slave may respond to any given bus address; the bus controller will generate a /BERR signal if more than one slave responds to an address, or if a single slave responds to an address reserved for the local bus (this is called a bus collision, and should never happen in normal operation). Slaves don't usually respond to CPU memory space or other reserved memory space types, as indicated by the memory space code on the FCn lines (see the Signal Description section following this section for details). The data phase is the next part of the cycle, and it's started when the bus master asserts DOE onto the bus, indicating that data operations can be started. The strobes are the same for both read and write cycles, but the data transfer direction is different. For a read cycle, the bus master drives at least one of the data strobes /DSn , indicating the physical transfer size requested (however, cachable slaves must always supply all 32 bits of data). The slave responds by driving data onto the bus, and then asserting /DTACK . The bus master then terminates the cycle by negating /FCS , at which point the slave will negate its /SLAVEn line and tri-state its data. The cycle is done at this point. There are a few actions that modify a cycle termination , those will be covered in later sections. The write cycle starts out the same way, up until DOE is asserted. At this point, it's the master that must drive data onto the bus, and then assert at least one /DSn line to indicate to the slave that data is valid and which data bytes are being written. The slave has the data for its use until it terminates the cycle by asserting /DTACK , at which point the master can negate /FCS and tri-state its data at any point. For maximum bus bandwidth, the slave can latch data on the falling edge of the logically ORed data strobes; the bus master doesn't sample /DTACK until after the data strobes are asserted, so a slave can actually assert /DTACK any time after /FCS .
