TITLE: F / / Interface Signals / RES - reset input

F / / Interface Signals / RES - reset input ]" border=0> A low on the RES pin resets all internal registers. The port pins are set as inputs and port registers to zero (although a read of the ports will return all highs because of passive pull-ups). The timer control registers are set to zero and the timer latches to all ones. All other registers are reset to zero. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
