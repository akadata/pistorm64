TITLE: 5 / Forming and Playing a Sound / Telling the System About the Data

5 / Forming and Playing a Sound / Telling the System About the Data ]" border=0> In order to retrieve the sound data for the audio channel, the system needs to know where the data is located and how long (in words) the data is. The location registers AUDxLCH and AUDxLCL contain the high three bits and the low fifteen bits, respectively, of the starting address of the audio data. Since these two register addresses are contiguous, writing a long word into AUDxLCH moves the audio data address into both locations. The "x" in the register names stands for the number of the audio channel where the output will occur. The channels are numbered 0, 1, 2, and 3. These registers are location registers, as distinguished from pointer registers. You need to specify the contents of these registers only once; no resetting is necessary when you wish the audio channel to keep on repeating the same waveform. Each time the system retrieves the last audio word from the data area, it uses the contents of these location registers to again find the start of the data. Assuming the first word of data starts at location "audiodata" and you are using channel 0, here is how to set the location registers: WHERE0DATA: LEA CUSTOM,a0 ; Base chip address... LEA AUDIODATA,a1 MOVE.L a1,AUD0LCH(a0) ;Put address (32 bits) ; into location register. The length of the data is the number of samples in your waveform divided by 2, or the number of words in the data set. Using the sample data set above, the length of the data is 16 words. You write this length into the audio data length register for this channel. The length register is called AUDxLEN, where "x" refers to the channel number. You set the length register AUD0LEN to 16 as shown below. SETAUD0LENGTH: LEA CUSTOM,a0 ; Base chip address MOVE.W #16,AUD0LEN(a0) ; Store the length... [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
