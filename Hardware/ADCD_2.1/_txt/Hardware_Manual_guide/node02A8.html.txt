TITLE: K / / Advanced Mode Support Logic / Bus Locking

K / / Advanced Mode Support Logic / Bus Locking ]" border=0> The first advanced modification of the basic bus cycle is bus locking, via the /LOCK signal. Bus locking is a hardware convention that allows a bus master to guarantee several cycles will be atomic on the bus. This is necessary to support the sharing of special "mail-box" memory between a bus master and an alternate PIC-based processor; Bridge Cards are an example of this kind of device. The Zorro II bus itself supports bus locking via the 68000 convention. However, the 68000 style of bus locking is often difficult to implement, and support for it was often ignored in Zorro II designs, especially those not directly concerned with multiprocessor support. The Zorro III mechanism involves no change to the basic bus cycle, other than the monitoring of this /LOCK signal, and as such is much more reasonable to support. The /LOCK signal is asserted by a bus master at address time and maintained across cycles to lock out shared memory coprocessors, allowing hardware backed semaphores to easily be used between such coprocessors. We expect multiprocessing will be a greater concern on the Zorro III bus than it is at present; video coprocessors, RISC devices, and special purpose processors for image processing or mathematics should find a comfortable home on the Zorro III bus.
