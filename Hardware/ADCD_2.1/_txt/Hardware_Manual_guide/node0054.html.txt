TITLE: 2 / Putting Together a Copper List / Complete Sample Copper List

2 / Putting Together a Copper List / Complete Sample Copper List ]" border=0> The following example shows a complete Copper list. This list is for two bitplanes -- one at $21000 and one at $25000. At the top of the screen, the color registers are loaded with the following values: Register Color -------- ----- COLOR00 white COLOR01 red COLOR02 green COLOR03 blue At line 150 on the screen, the color registers are reloaded: Register Color -------- ----- COLOR00 black COLOR01 yellow COLOR02 cyan COLOR03 magenta The complete Copper list follows. ; ; Notes: 1. Copper lists must be in Chip RAM. ; 2. Bitplane addresses used in the example are arbitrary. ; 3. Destination register addresses in Copper move instructions ; are offsets from the base address of the custom chips. ; 4. As always, hardware manual examples assume that your ; application has taken full control of the hardware, and is not ; conflicting with operating system use of the same hardware. ; 5. Many of the examples just pick memory addresses to be used. ; Normally you would need to allocate the required type of ; memory from the system with AllocMem() ; 6. As stated earlier, the code examples are mainly to help ; clarify the way the hardware works. ; 7. The following INCLUDE files are required by all example code ; in this chapter. ; INCLUDE "exec/types.i" INCLUDE "hardware/custom.i" INCLUDE "hardware/dmabits.i" INCLUDE "hardware/hw_examples.i" COPPERLIST: ; ; Set up pointers to two bitplanes ; DC.W BPL1PTH,$0002 ;Move $0002 into register $0E0 (BPL1PTH) DC.W BPL1PTL,$1000 ;Move $1000 into register $0E2 (BPL1PTL) DC.W BPL2PTH,$0002 ;Move $0002 into register $0E4 (BPL2PTH) DC.W BPL2PTL,$5000 ;Move $5000 into register $0E6 (BPL2PTL) ; ; Load color registers ; DC.W COLOR00,$0FFF ;Move white into register $180 (COLOR00) DC.W COLOR01,$0F00 ;Move red into register $182 (COLOR01) DC.W COLOR02,$00F0 ;Move green into register $184 (COLOR02) DC.W COLOR03,$000F ;Move blue into register $186 (COLOR03) ; ; Specify 2 Lores bitplanes ; DC.W BPLCON0,$2200 ;2 lores planes, coloron ; ; Wait for line 150 ; DC.W $9601,$FF00 ;Wait for line 150, ignore horiz. position ; ; Change color registers mid-display ; DC.W COLOR00,$0000 ;Move black into register $0180 (COLOR00) DC.W COLOR01,$0FF0 ;Move yellow into register $0182 (COLOR01) DC.W COLOR02,$00FF ;Move cyan into register $0184 (COLOR02) DC.W COLOR03,$0F0F ;Move magenta into register $0186 (COLOR03) ; ; End Copper list by waiting for the impossible ; DC.W $FFFF,$FFFE ;Wait for line 255, H = 254 (never happens) For more information about color registers , see Chapter 3, "Playfield Hardware."
