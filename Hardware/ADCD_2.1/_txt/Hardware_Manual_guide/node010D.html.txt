E / / Game Controller Interface Spec / Proportional Controllers ]" border=0> Resistive (potentiometer) element linear taper proportional controllers are supported up to 528k Ohms max (470k +/- 10% recommended). The JOY[0/1]DAT registers contain digital translation values for y in the high byte and x in the low byte. A higher count value indicates a higher external resistance. The Amiga performs an integrating analog-to-digital conversion as follows: 1. For the first 7 (NTSC) or 8 (PAL) horizontal display lines, the analog input capacitors are discharged and the positions counters reflected in the POT[O/1]DAT registers are held reset. For the remainder of the display field, the input capacitors are allowed to recharge through the resistive element in the external control device. 2. The gradually increasing voltage is continuously compared to an internal reference level while counter keeps track of the number of lines since the end of the reset interval. 3. When the input voltage finally exceeds the internal threshold for a given input channel, the current counter value is latched into the POT[O/1]DAT register corresponding to that channel. 4. During the vertical blanking interval, the software examines the resulting POT[O/1]DAT register values and interprets the counts in terms of joystick position. NOTE: ----- The POTY and POTX inputs are designated as "right mouse button" and "unused mouse button" respectively. An opened switch corresponds to high resistance, a closed switch to a low resistance. The buttons are also available in POTGO and POTGOR registers. It is recommended that ROM kernel calls be used for future hardware compatibility. It is important to realize that the proportional controller is more of a "pointing" device than an absolute position input. It is up to the software to provide the calibration, range limiting and averaging functions needed to support the application's control requirements. The POT[0/1]DAT registers are typically read during video blanking, but MAY be available prior to that.
