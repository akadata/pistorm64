TITLE: Glossary / RAM

Glossary / RAM ]" border=0> Short for random access memory. RAM is the part of the Amiga's memory which can be used for data storage and is directly accessible by the CPU. RAM storage is volatile, meaning that data in RAM is lost when the Amiga is rebooted or turned off; as opposed to ROM memory which is permanent. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
