TITLE: 3 / / Bitplanes and Color / The Color Table

3 / / Bitplanes and Color / The Color Table ]" border=0> The color table contains 32 registers, and you may load a different color into each of the registers. Here is a condensed view of the contents of the color table: Register Name Contents Meaning ------------- -------- ------- COLOR00 12 bits User-defined color for the background area and borders. COLOR01 12 bits User-defined color number 1 (For example, the alternate color selection for a two-color playfield). COLOR02 12 bits User-defined color number 2. . . . . . . COLOR31 12 bits User-defined color number 31. Table 3-2: Portion of the Color Table COLOR00 is always reserved for the background color. The background color shows in any area on the display where there is no other object present and is also displayed outside the defined display window, in the border area. Genlocks and the background color. --------------------------------- If you are using the optional genlock board for video input from a camera, VCR, or laser disk, the background color will be replaced by the incoming video display. Twelve bits of color selection allow you to define, for each of the 32 registers, one of 4,096 possible colors, as shown in Table 3-3. Bits Color ---- ----- Bits 15 - 12 Unused Bits 11 - 8 Red Bits 7 - 4 Green Bits 3 - 0 Blue Table 3-3: Contents of the Color Registers Table 3-4 shows some sample color register bit assignments and the resulting colors. At the end of the chapter is a more extensive Color Register list . Contents of the Resulting Color Register Color --------------- --------- $FFF White $6FE Sky blue $DB9 Tan $000 Black Table 3-4: Sample Color Register Contents Some sample instructions for loading the color registers are shown below: LEA CUSTOM,a0 ; Get base address of custom hardware... MOVE.W #$FFF,COLOR00(a0) ; Load white into color register 0 MOVE.W #$6FE,COLOR01(a0) ; Load sky blue into color register 1 The color registers are write-only. ---------------------------------- Only by looking at the screen can you find out the contents of each color register. As a standard practice, then, for these and certain other write-only registers, you may wish to keep a "back-up" or "shadow" copy in RAM. As you write to the color register itself, you should update this RAM copy. If you do so, you will always know the value each register contains. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
