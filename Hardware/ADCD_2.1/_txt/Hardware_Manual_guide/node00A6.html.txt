TITLE: C / ECS Hardware and Graphics Library / Multi-Sync and Bi-Sync Monitors

C / ECS Hardware and Graphics Library / Multi-Sync and Bi-Sync Monitors ]" border=0> The enhanced Agnus now includes registers for setting a standard programmable scan rate. The scan rates supported in the V36 graphics.library include: NTSC (525 lines, 227.5 colorclocks per scan line) PAL (625 lines, 227.5 colorclocks per scan line) VGA (525 lines, 114.0 colorclocks per scan line) The V36 graphics.library controls the variable number of colorclocks on each horizontal scan line with a combination of registers. Each combination of registers provides a different frequency of scan rate and number of lines per display field: HTOTAL W A Highest number count in horizontal line Bit 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 10 00 Use 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 h8 h7 h6 h5 h4 h3 h2 h1 The value in this register represents the number of 280ns increments on the horizontal line. VTOTAL W A Highest numbered vertical line VTOTAL contains the line number at which to reset the vertical position counter. This value represents the number of lines in a field(+1). The exception is if the INTERLACE bit is set (BPLCON0). In this case this value represents the number of lines in the long field (+2) and the number of lines in the short field (+1). Programmable synchronization is implemented through five new enhanced Agnus registers: VSSTRT W A Vertical line position for VSYNC start VSSTOP W A Vertical line position for VSYNC stop HSSTRT W A Horizontal line position for HSYNC start HSSTOP W A Horizontal line position for HSYNC stop HCENTER W A Horizontal position for Vsync on interlace A reasonable composite can be generated by setting HCENTER half a horizontal line from HSSTRT, and HBSTOP at (HSSTOP-HSSTRT) before HCENTER, with HBSTRT at (HSSTOP-HSSTRT) before HSSTRT. Programmable blanking is implemented through four new ECS Agnus registers: HBSTRT W A Horizontal line position for HBLANK start HBSTOP W A Horizontal line position for HBLANK stop VBSTRT W A Vertical line position for VBLANK start VBSTOP W A Vertical line position for VBLANK stop [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
