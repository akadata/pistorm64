E / Explanation of I/O Connectors / Serial Interface Specification ]" border=0> This 25-pin D-type connector with sockets (DB25S=female) is used to interface to RS-232-C standard signals. Signal names correspond to those used in other places in this appendix, when possible. WARNING: -------- Pins on the RS232 connector other than these standard ones described below may be connected to power or other non-RS232 standard signals. When making up RS232 cables, connect only those pins actually used for a particular application. Avoid generic 25-connector "straight- thru" cables.
