F / / Interface Signals / DB7-DB0 - data bus inputs/outputs ]" border=0> The eight data bus output pins transfer information between the 8520 and the system data bus. These pins are high impedance inputs unless CS is low and R/W and 02 are high, to read the device. During this read, the data bus output buffers are enabled, driving the data from the selected register onto the system data bus. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
