4 / / Control Registers / SPR0CTL ]" border=0> This register is normally used only by the sprite DMA channel . It contains control information that is used to control the sprite data-fetch process. Bit positions: * Bits 15-8 specify vertical stop position for a sprite image, bits V7 - V0. * Bit 7 is the attach bit. This bit is valid only for odd-numbered sprites. It indicates that sprites 0, 1 (or 2,3 or 4,5 or 6,7) will, for color interpretation, be considered as paired, and as such will be called four bits deep. The odd-numbered (higher number) sprite contains bits with the higher binary significance. During attach mode, the attached sprites are normally moved horizontally and vertically together under processor control. This allows a greater selection of colors within the boundaries of the sprite itself. The sprites, although attached, remain capable of independent motion, however, and they will assume this larger color set only when their edges overlay one another. * Bits 6-3 are reserved for future use (make zero). * Bit 2 is bit V8 of vertical start. * Bit 1 is bit V8 of vertical stop. * Bit 0 is bit H0 of horizontal start. Position and control registers for the other sprites work the same way as described above for sprite 0. The register names for the other sprites are: SPR1POS SPR1CTL SPR2POS SPR2CTL SPR3POS SPR3CTL SPR4POS SPR4CTL SPR5POS SPR5CTL SPR6POS SPR6CTL SPR7POS SPR7CTL [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
