3 / / Coding For Correct Coloring / A One- or Two-Color Playfield ]" border=0> For a one-color playfield, all you need do is write "0"s in all the bits of the single bitplane as shown in the example below. This code fills a low resolution bitplane with the background color ( COLOR00 ) by writing all "0"s into its memory area. The bitplane starts at $21000 and is 8,000 bytes long. LEA $21000,a0 ; Point at bitplane MOVE.W #2000,d0 ; Write 2000 longwords = 8000 bytes LOOP: MOVE.L #0,(a0)+ ; Write out a zero DBRA d0,LOOP ; Decrement counter and loop until done... For a two-color playfield, you define a bitplane that has "0"s where you want the background color and "1"s where you want the color in register 1. The following example code is identical to the last example, except the bitplane is filled with $FF00FF00 instead of all 0's. This will produce two colors. LEA $21000,a0 ; Point at bitplane MOVE.W #2000,d0 ; Write 2000 longwords = 8000 bytes LOOP: MOVE.L #$FF00FF00,(a0)+ ; Write out $FF00FF00 DBRA d0,LOOP ; Decrement counter and loop until done...
