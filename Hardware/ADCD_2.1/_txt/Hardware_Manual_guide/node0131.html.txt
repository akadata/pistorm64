TITLE: F / Register Functional Description / I/O Ports (PRA, PRB, DDRA, DDRB)

F / Register Functional Description / I/O Ports (PRA, PRB, DDRA, DDRB) ]" border=0> Ports A and B each consist of an 8-bit peripheral data register (PR) and an 8-bit data direction register (DDR). If a bit in the DDR is set to a 1, the corresponding bit position in the PR becomes an output. If a DDR bit is set to a 0, the corresponding PR bit is defined as an input. When you READ a PR register, you read the actual current state of the I/O pins (PA0-PA7, PB0-PB7, regardless of whether you have set them to be inputs or outputs. Ports A and B have passive pull-up devices as well as active pull-ups, providing both CMOS and TTL compatibility. Both ports have two TTL load drive capability. In addition to their normal I/O operations, ports PB6 and PB7 also provide timer output functions. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
