3 / / Horizontal Scrolling / Specifying Amount of Delay ]" border=0> The amount of delay in horizontal scrolling is controlled by bits 7-0 in BPLCON1. You set the delay separately for each playfield; bits 3-0 for playfield 1 (bitplanes 1, 3, and 5) and bits 7-4 for playfield 2 (bitplanes 2, 4, and 6). Warning: -------- Always set all six bits, even if you have only one playfield. Set 3-0 and 7-4 to the same value if you are using only one playfield. The following example sets the horizontal scroll delay to 7 for both playfields. MOVE.W #$77,BPLCON1+CUSTOM [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
