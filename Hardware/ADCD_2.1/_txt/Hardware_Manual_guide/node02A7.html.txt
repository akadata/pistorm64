TITLE: K / Zorro III Bus Architecture / Advanced Mode Support Logic

K / Zorro III Bus Architecture / Advanced Mode Support Logic ]" border=0> The Zorro III bus provides support for some more advanced operations that weren't generally handled correctly on the Zorro II bus. Amiga computers have traditionally been supporting features that the more mainstream personal computers haven't. High speed DMA transfers and expansion coprocessors such as the Bridge Cards have been with the Amiga since the early days, and high performance main system CPUs with cache memory are now becoming common. The Zorro II bus never properly or easily supported such devices; the Zorro III bus attempts to make support of cache and coprocessor both possible and relatively straightforward. Other new features are covered in later sections. Bus Locking Cache Support [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
