TITLE: F 8520 Complex Interface Adapters / Port Signal Assignments

F 8520 Complex Interface Adapters / Port Signal Assignments ]" border=0> This part specifies how various signals relate to the available ports of the 8520. This information enables the programmer to relate the port addresses to the outside-world items (or internal control signals) which are to be affected. This part is primarily for the use of the systems programmer and should generally not be used by applications programmers. Systems software normally is configured to handle the setting of particular signals, no matter how the physical connections may change. Warning: -------- In a multitasking operating system, many different tasks may be competing for the use of the system resources. Applications programmers should follow the established rules for resource access in order to assure compatibility of their software with the system.
