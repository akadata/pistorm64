8 Interface Hardware / Controller Port Interface ]" border=0> Each Amiga has two nine-pin connectors that can be used for input or output with a variety of controllers. Usually, the nine-pin connectors are used with a mouse or joystick but they will also accept input from light pens, paddles, trackballs, and other popular input devices. Figure 8-1 shows one of the two connectors and the corresponding face-on view of a standard controller plug, while table 8-1 gives the pin assignments for some typical controllers.
