TITLE: 8 Interface Hardware / Floppy Disk Controller

8 Interface Hardware / Floppy Disk Controller ]" border=0> The built-in disk controller in the system can handle up to four MFM-type devices. Typically these are double-sided, double-density, 3.5" (90mm) or 5.25" disk drives. One 3.5" drive is installed in the basic unit. The controller is extremely flexible. It can DMA an entire track of raw MFM data into memory in a single disk revolution. Special registers allow the CPU to synchronize with specific data, or read input a byte at a time. The controller can read and write virtually any double-density MFM encoded disk, including the Amiga V1.0 format, IBM PC (MS-DOS) 5.25", IBM PC (MS-DOS) 3.5" and most CP/M (TM) formatted disks. The controller has provisions for reading and writing most disk using the Group Coded Recording (GCR) method, including Apple II (TM) disks. With motor speed tricks, the controller can read and write Commodore 1541/1571 format diskettes.
