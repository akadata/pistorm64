TITLE: K / / Changes from the A2000 Bus / Bus Synchronization Delays

K / / Changes from the A2000 Bus / Bus Synchronization Delays ]" border=0> Due to the asynchronous nature of the local-to-expansion bus interface for Zorro II cycles, extra wait states may occasionally be added for local to expansion or expansion to local cycles. These are generally manifested as delays between consecutive cycles, since the bus controller is not going to require extra waiting during the cycle -- things will have already been synchronized at that point. The synchronization problems get more difficult for Zorro II master access to local bus slaves, and as a result, wait states here are very common. The actual number of wait states generated in any case will be based on the particular implementation. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
