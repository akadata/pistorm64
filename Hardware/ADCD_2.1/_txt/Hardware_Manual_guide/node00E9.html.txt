TITLE: 5 / Producing High-quality Sound / Making Waveform Transitions

5 / Producing High-quality Sound / Making Waveform Transitions ]" border=0> To avoid unpleasant sounds when you change from one waveform to another, you need to make the transitions smooth. You can avoid "clicks" by making sure the waveforms start and end at approximately the same value. You can avoid "pops" by starting a waveform only at a zero-crossing point. You can avoid "thumps" by arranging the average amplitude of each wave to be about the same value. The average amplitude is the sum of the bytes in the waveform divided by the number of bytes in the waveform. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
