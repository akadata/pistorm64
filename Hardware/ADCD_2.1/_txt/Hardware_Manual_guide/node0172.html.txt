Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: G Keyboard Interface ]" border=0> This appendix contains the keyboard interface specification for A1000, A500, A2000 and A3000. The keyboard plugs into the Amiga computer via a cable with four primary connections . The four wires provide 5-volt power, ground, and signals called KCLK (keyboard clock) and KDAT (keyboard data). KCLK is unidirectional and always driven by the keyboard; KDAT is driven by both the keyboard and the computer. Both signals are open-collector; there are pullup resistors in both the keyboard (inside the keyboard microprocessor) and the computer.
