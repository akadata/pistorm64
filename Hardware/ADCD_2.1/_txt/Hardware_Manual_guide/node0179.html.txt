TITLE: G Keyboard Interface / Hard Reset

G Keyboard Interface / Hard Reset ]" border=0> About Hard Reset. ----------------- Hard Reset happens after Reset Warning . Valid for all keyboards except the Amiga 500. The keyboard Hard Resets the Amiga by pulling KCLK low and starting a 500 millisecond timer. When one or more of the keys is released and 500 milliseconds have passed, the keyboard will release KCLK. 500 milliseconds is the minimum time KCLK must be held low. The maximum KCLK time depends on how long the user holds the three reset keys down. Circuitry on the Amiga motherboard detects the 500 millisecond KCLK pulse. After releasing KCLK, the keyboard jumps to its start-up code (internal RESET). This will initialize the keyboard in the same way as cold power-on . NOTE: ----- The keyboard must resend the " powerup key stream "! [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
