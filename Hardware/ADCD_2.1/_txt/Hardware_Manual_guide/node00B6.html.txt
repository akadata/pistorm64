4 / Forming a Sprite / Shape of Sprites ]" border=0> A sprite can have any shape that will fit within the 16-pixel width. You define a sprite's shape by specifying which pixels actually appear in each of the sprite's locations. For example, Figures 4-3 and 4-4 show a spaceship whose shape is marked by Xs. The first figure shows only the spaceship as you might sketch it out on graph paper. The second figure shows the spaceship within the 16-pixel width. The 0s around the spaceship mark the part of the sprite not covered by the spaceship and transparent when displayed.

Whenever the shape is narrower than the sprite, you can control which part of the sprite is used to define the shape. This particular shape could also start at any of the pixels from 2-7 instead of pixel 1. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
