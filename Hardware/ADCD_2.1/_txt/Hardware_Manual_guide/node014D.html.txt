TITLE: F / / Interface Signals / Clock input

F / / Interface Signals / Clock input ]" border=0> The 02 clock is a TTL compatible input used for internal device operation and as a timing reference for communicating with the system data bus. On the Amiga, this is connected to the 680x0 "E" clock. The "E" clock runs at 1/10 of the CPU clock. This works out to .715909 Mhz for NTSC or .709379 Mhz for PAL. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
