TITLE: Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: 3 Playfield Hardware

Amiga® Hardware Reference Manual: 3 Playfield Hardware ]" border=0> The screen display of the Amiga consists of two basic parts -- playfields, which are sometimes called backgrounds, and sprites, which are easily movable graphics objects. This chapter describes how to directly access hardware registers to form playfields. The chapter begins with a brief overview of playfield features and covers the following major topics: * Forming a single "basic" playfield, which is a playfield the same size as the display screen. This section includes concepts that are fundamental to forming any playfield. * Forming a dual-playfield display in which one playfield is superimposed upon another. This procedure differs from that of forming a basic playfield in some details. * Forming playfields of various sizes and displaying only part of a larger playfield. * Moving playfields by scrolling them vertically and horizontally. * Advanced topics to help you use playfields in special situations. For information about movable sprite objects , see Chapter 4, Sprite Hardware. There are also movable playfield objects, which are subsections of a playfield. To move portions of a playfield, you use a technique called playfield animation , which is described in Chapter 6, Blitter Hardware. For information relating to the playfield hardware in the Enhanced Chip Set (ECS), such as SuperHires Mode , programmable scan rates and synchronization , see Appendix C.
