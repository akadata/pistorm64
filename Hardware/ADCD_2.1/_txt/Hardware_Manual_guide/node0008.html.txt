TITLE: 1 / Components of the Amiga / VCR and Direct Camera Interface

1 / Components of the Amiga / VCR and Direct Camera Interface ]" border=0> In addition to the connectors for monochrome composite, and analog or digital RGB monitors, the Amiga can be expanded to include a VCR or camera interface. The system is capable of synchronizing with an external video source and replacing the system background color with the external image. This allows development of fully integrated video images with computer generated graphics. Laser disk input is accepted in the same manner. The A2000 and A3000 models also provide a special internal slot designed for video applications. This allows the Amiga to use low-cost video expansion boards such as genlocks and frame-grabbers.
