G Keyboard Interface / Keycodes ]" border=0> Each key has a keycode associated with it (see accompanying table ). Keycodes are always 7 bits long. The eighth bit is a "key-up"/"key-down" flag; a 0 (high level) means that the key was pushed down, and a 1 (low level) means the key was released (the Caps Lock key is different -- see below). For example, here is a diagram of the "B" key being pushed down. The keycode for "B" is $35 = 00110101; due to the rotation of the byte, the bits transmitted are 01101010. _____ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ _________ KCLK \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ _________ _____ _____ _____________ KDAT \___________/ \_____/ \_____/ 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 In the next example, the B key is released. The keycode is still $35, except that bit 7 is set to indicate "key-up," resulting in a code of $B5 = 10110101. After rotating, the transmission will be 01101011: _____ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ _________ KCLK \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ _________ _____ _____ _______ KDAT \___________/ \_____/ \___________/ 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
