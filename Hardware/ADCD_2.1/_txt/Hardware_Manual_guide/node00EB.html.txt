5 / Producing High-quality Sound / Efficiency ]" border=0> A certain amount of overhead is involved in the handling of audio DMA. If you are trying to produce a smooth continuous audio synthesis, you should try to avoid as much of the system control overhead as possible. Basically, the larger the audio buffer you provide to the system, the less often it will need to interrupt to reset the pointers to the top of the next buffer and, coincidentally, the lower the amount of system interaction that will be required. If there is only one waveform buffer, the hardware automatically resets the pointers, so no software overhead is used for resetting them. The Joining Tones section illustrated how you could join "ends" of tones together by responding to interrupts and changing the values of the location registers to splice tones together. If your system is heavily loaded, it is possible that the response to the interrupt might not happen in time to assure a smooth audio transition. Therefore, it is advisable to utilize the longest possible audio table where a smooth output is required. This takes advantage of the audio DMA capability as well as minimizing the number of interrupts to which the 680x0 must respond. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
