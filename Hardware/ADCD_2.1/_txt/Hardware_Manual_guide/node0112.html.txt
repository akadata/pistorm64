E / / External Disk Interface Specification / Limitations ]" border=0> 1. The total cable length, including daisy chaining, must not exceed 1 meter. 2. A maximum of 3 external devices may reside on this interface, but specific implementations may support fewer external devices. 3. Each device must provide a 1000-Ohm pull-up resistor on those outputs driven by an open-collector device on the Amiga (pins 8-10, 16-21). 4. The system provides power for only the first external device in the daisy chains. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
