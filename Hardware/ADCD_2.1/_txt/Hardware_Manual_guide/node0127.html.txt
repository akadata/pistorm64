TITLE: 6 Blitter Hardware / Pipeline Register

6 Blitter Hardware / Pipeline Register ]" border=0> The blitter performs many operations in each cycle -- shifting and masking source words, logical combination of sources, and area fill and zero detect on the output. To enable so many things to take place so quickly, the blitter is pipelined. This means that rather than performing all of the above operations in one blitter cycle, the operations are spread over two blitter cycles. (Here "cycle" is used very loosely for simplicity.) To clarify this, the blitter can be imagined as two chips connected in series. Every cycle, a new set of source operations come in, and the first chip performs its operations on the data. It then passes the half-processed data to the second chip to be finished during the next cycle, when the first chip will be busy at work on the next set of data. Each set of data takes two "cycles" to get through the two chips, overlapped so a set of data can be pumped through each cycle. What all this means is that the first two sets of sources are fetched before the first destination is written. This allows you to shift a bitmap up to one word to the right using ascending mode, for instance, even though normally parts of the destination would be overwritten before they were fetched.

This is due to internal pipelining. Care must be taken with overlapping source and destination regions. Warning: -------- This Table is only meant to be an illustration of the typical order of blitter cycles on the bus. Bus cycles are dynamically allocated based on blitter operating mode; competing bus activity from processor, bitplanes, and other DMA channels ; and other factors.
