Primitive Data Types / Strings, String Chunks, and String Properties ]" border=0> In a string of ASCII text, linefeed (0x0A) denotes a forced line break (paragraph or line terminator). Other control characters are not used. (Cf. Characters.) For maximum compatibility with line editors, two linefeed characters are often used to indicate a paragraph boundary. The ckID for a chunk that contains a string of plain, unformatted text is "TEXT". As a practical matter, a text string should probably not be longer than 32767 bytes. The standard allows up to 2^31 - 1 bytes. The ckID "TEXT" is globally reserved for this use. When used as a data property (see below), a text string chunk may be 0 to 255 characters long. Such a string is readily converted to a C string or a Pascal STRING[255]. The ckID of a property must have a unique property name, not "TEXT". When used as a part of a chunk or data property, restricted C string format is normally used. That means 0 to 255 characters followed by a NULL byte (ASCII value 0). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
