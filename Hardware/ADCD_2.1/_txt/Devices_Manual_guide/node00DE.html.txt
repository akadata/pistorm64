TITLE: 14 Trackdisk Device / Device Interface

14 Trackdisk Device / Device Interface ]" border=0> The trackdisk device operates like other Amiga devices. To use it, you must first open the device, then send I/O requests to it, and then close it when finished. See the " Introduction to Amiga System Devices " chapter for general information on device usage. The trackdisk device uses two different types of I/O request blocks, IOStdReq and IOExtTD and two types of commands, standard and extended. An IOExtTD is required for the extended trackdisk commands (those beginning with "ETD_"), but can be used for both types of commands. Thus, the IOExtTD is the type of I/O request that will be used in this chapter. struct IOExtTD { struct IOStdReq iotd_Req; ULONG iotd_Count; /* Diskchange counter */ ULONG iotd_SecLabel; /* Sector label data */ }; See the include file devices/ trackdisk.h for the complete structure definition. The enhanced commands listed above - those beginning with "ETD_" - are similar to their standard counterparts but have additional features: they allow you to control whether a command will be executed if the disk has been changed and they allow you to read or write to the sector label portion of a sector. Enhanced commands require a larger I/O request, IOExtTD, than the IOStdReq request used by the standard commands. IOExtTD contains extra information needed by the enhanced command; since the standard form of a command ignores the extra fields, IOExtTD requests can be used for both types. The extra information takes the form of two extra longwords at the end of the data structure. These commands are performed only if the change count is less than or equal to the value in the iotd_Count field of the command's request block. The iotd_Count field keeps old I/O requests from being performed when the disk is changed. Any request found with an iotd_Count less than the current change counter value will be returned with a characteristic error (TDERR_DiskChange) in the io_Error field. This allows stale I/O requests to be returned to the user after a disk has been changed. The current disk-change counter value can be obtained by TD_CHANGENUM . If the user wants enhanced disk I/O but does not care about disk removal, then iotd_Count may be set to the maximum unsigned long integer value (0xFFFFFFFF). The iotd_SecLabel field allows access to the sector identification section of the sector header. Each sector has 16 bytes of descriptive data space available to it; the trackdisk device does not interpret this data. If iotd_SecLabel is NULL, then this descriptive data is ignored. If it is not NULL, then iotd_SecLabel should point to a series of contiguous 16-byte chunks (one for each sector that is to be read or written). These chunks will be written out to the sector's label region on a write or filled with the sector's label area on a read. If a CMD_WRITE (the standard write call) is done, then the sector label area is left unchanged.
