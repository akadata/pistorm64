AIFF.doc / AIFF / The Audio Recording Chunk ]" border=0> The Audio Recording Chunk contains information pertinent to audio recording devices. #define AudioRecordingID 'AESD' /* ckID for Audio Recording */ /* Chunk. */ typedef struct { ID ckID long ckSize; unsigned char AESChannelStatusData[24]; } AudioRecordingChunk; The ckID is always 'AESD'. The ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes For the Audio Recording Chunk, ckSize is always 24. The 24 bytes of AESCChannelStatusData are specified in the "AES Recommended Practice for Digital Audio Engineering - Serial Transmission Format for Linearly Represented Digital Audio Data", transmission of digital audio between audio devices. This information is duplicated in the Audio Recording Chunk for convenience. Of general interest would be bits 2, 3, and 4 of byte 0, which describe recording emphasis. The Audio Recording Chunk is optional. No more than one Audio Recording Chunk may appear in a FORM AIFF. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
