TITLE: Primitive Data Types / Dates

Primitive Data Types / Dates ]" border=0> A "creation date" is defined as the date and time a stream of data bytes was created. (Some systems call this a "last modified date".) Editing some data changes its creation date. Moving the data between volumes or machines does not. The IFF standard date format will be one of those used in MS-DOS, Macintosh, or AmigaDOS (probably a 32-bit unsigned number of seconds since a reference point). Issue: Investigate these three.
