ILBM.CLUT.doc / Design Notes ]" border=0> I have deliberately kept this chunk simple (KISS) to facilitate implementation. In particular, no provision is made for expansion to 16-bit or 32-bit tables. My reasoning is that a 16-bit table can have 64K entries, and thus would benefit from data compression. My suggestion would be to propose another chunk or FORM type better suited for large tables rather than small ones like CLUT. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
