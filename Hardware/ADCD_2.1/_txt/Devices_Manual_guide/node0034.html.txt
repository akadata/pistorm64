TITLE: 2 / Hardware Control Commands / ADCMD_FINISH

2 / Hardware Control Commands / ADCMD_FINISH ]" border=0> The ADCMD_FINISH command aborts (calls AbortIO() ) the current write request on a channel or channels. This is useful if you have something playing, such as a long buffer or some repetitions of a buffer, and you want to stop it. ADCMD_FINISH has a flag you can set (ADIOF_SYNCCYCLE) that allows the waveform to finish the current cycle before aborting it. This is useful for splicing together sounds at zero crossings or some other place in the waveform where the amplitude at the end of one waveform matches the amplitude at the beginning of the next. Zero crossings are positions within the waveform at which the amplitude is zero. Splicing at zero crossings gives you fewer clicks and pops when the audio channel is turned off or the volume is changed. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
