A / IFF Third Party Public Form & Chunk Specification / 8SVXSEQN.FADE.doc ]" border=0> Looping chunks for 8SVX form SEQN and FADE Chunks Multiple Loop Sequencing in the '8SVX' IFF 8-bit Sample Voice ------------------------------------------------------------- Registered by Peter Norman, RamScan Software Pty Ltd. Sound samples are notorious for demanding huge amounts of memory. While earlier uses of digital sound on the Amiga were mainly in the form of short looping waveforms for use as musical instruments, many people today wish to record several seconds (even minutes) of sound. This of course eats memory. Assuming that quite often the content of these recordings is music, and that quite often music contains several passages which repeat at given times, "verse1 .. chorus .. verse2 .. chorus .." etc, a useful extention has been added to the 8SVX list of optional data chunks. It's purpose is to conserve memory by having the computer repeat sections rather than having several instances of a similar sound or musical passage taking up valuable sample space. The 'SEQN' chunk has been created to define "Multiple" loops or sections within a single octave 8SVX MONO or STEREO waveform. It is intended that a sampled sound player program which supports this chunk will play sections of the waveform sequentially in an order that the SEQN chunk specifies. This means for example, if an identical chorus repeats throughout a recording, rather than have this chorus stored several times along the waveform, it is only necessary to have one copy of the chorus stored in the waveform. A "SEQeNce" of definitions can then be set up to have the computer loop back and repeat the chorus at the required time. The remaining choruses stored in the waveform will no longer be necessary and can be removed. E.g., if we had a recording of the following example, we would find that there are several parts which simply repeat. Substantial savings can be made by having the computer repeat sections rather than have them stored in memory. EXAMPLE Chunk Definitions [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
