4 / Reading from the Console Device / Information About The Input Stream ]" border=0> For the most part, keys whose keycaps are labeled with ANSI-standard characters will ordinarily be translated into their ASCII-equivalent character by the console device through the use of its keymap. Keymap information can be found in the " Keymap Library " chapter of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries. For keys other than those with normal ASCII equivalents, an escape sequence is generated and inserted into your input stream. For example, in the default state (no raw input events selected) the function, arrow and special keys (reserved for 101 key keyboards) will cause the sequences shown in the next table to be inserted in the input stream.
