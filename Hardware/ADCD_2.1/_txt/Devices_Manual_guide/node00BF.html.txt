TITLE: 13 Timer Device / Device Interface

13 Timer Device / Device Interface ]" border=0> The timer device operates in a similar manner to the other Amiga devices. To use it, you must first open it, then send I/O requests to it, and then close it when finished. See the Introduction to Amiga System Devices chapter for general information on device usage. The timer device also provides timer functions in addition to the usual I/O request protocol. These functions still require the device to be opened with the proper timer device unit, but do not require a message port. However, the base address of the timer library must be obtained in order to use the timer functions. The two modes of timer device operation are not mutually exclusive. You may use them both within the same application. The I/O request used by the timer device is called timerequest. struct timerequest { struct IORequest tr_node; struct timeval tr_time; }; The timer device functions are passed a time structure, either timeval for non E-Clock units or EClockVal for E-Clock units. struct timeval { ULONG tv_secs; /* seconds */ ULONG tv_micro; /* microseconds */ }; struct EClockVal { ULONG ev_hi; /* Upper longword of E-Clock time */ ULONG ev_lo; /* Lower longword of E-Clock time */ }; See the include file devices/ timer.h for the complete structure definitions. Time requests fall into three categories: * Time delay - wait a specified period of time. A time delay causes an application to wait a certain length of time. When a time delay is requested, the number of seconds and microseconds to delay are specified in the I/O request. * Time measure - how long something takes to complete. A time measure is a three-step procedure where the system or E-Clock time is retrieved, an operation or series of operations is performed, and then another time retrieval is done. The difference between the two time values is the measure of the duration of the operation. * Time alarm - wait till a specific time. A time alarm is a request to be notified when a specific time value has occurred. It is similar to a time delay except that the absolute time value is specified in the I/O request. What is an E-Clock? ------------------- The E-Clock is the clock used by the Motorola 68000 processor family to communicate with other Motorola 8-bit chips. The E-Clock returns two distinct values - the E-Clock value in the form of two longwords and the count rate (tics/second) of the E-Clock. The count rate is related to the master frequency of the machine and is different between PAL and NTSC machines.
