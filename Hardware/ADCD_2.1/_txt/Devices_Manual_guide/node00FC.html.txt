Amiga® RKM Devices: 7 Keyboard Device ]" border=0> The keyboard device gives low-level access to the Amiga keyboard. When you send this device the command to read one or more keystrokes from the keyboard, for each keystroke (whether key-up or key-down) the keyboard device creates a data structure called an input event to describe what happened. The keyboard device also provides the ability to do operations within the system reset processing (Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga).
