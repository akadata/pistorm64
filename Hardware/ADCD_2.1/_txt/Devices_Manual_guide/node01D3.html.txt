TITLE: Background for Designers / Think Ahead

Background for Designers / Think Ahead ]" border=0> Let's think ahead and build programs that read and write files for each other and for programs yet to be designed. Build data formats to last for future computers so long as the overhead is acceptable. This extends the usefulness and life of today's programs and data. To maximize interconnectivity, the standard file structure and the specific object formats must all be general and extensible. Think ahead when designing an object. File formats should serve many purposes and allow many programs to store and read back all the information they need; even squeeze in custom data. Then a programmer can store the available data and is encouraged to include fixed contextual details. Recipient programs can read the needed parts, skip unrecognized stuff, default missing data, and use the stored context to help transform the data as needed. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
