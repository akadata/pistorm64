TITLE: 10 / Dumping a Rastport to a Printer / Printer Special Flags

10 / Dumping a Rastport to a Printer / Printer Special Flags ]" border=0> The printer special flags (io_Flags) of the IODRPReq provide a high degree of control over the printing of a RastPort . SPECIAL_ASPECT Allows one of the dimensions to be reduced/expanded to preserve the correct aspect ratio of the printout. SPECIAL_CENTER Centers the image between the left and right edge of the paper. SPECIAL_NOFORMFEED Prevents the page from being ejected after a graphics dump. Usually used to mix graphics and text or multiple graphics dump on a page oriented printer (normally a laser printer). SPECIAL_NOPRINT The print size will be computed, and set in io_DestCols and io_DestRows, but won't print. This way the application can see what the actual printsize in printerpixels would be. SPECIAL_TRUSTME Instructs the printer not to send a reset before and after the dump. This flag is obsolete for V1.3 (and higher) drivers. SPECIAL_DENSITY1-7 This flag bit is set by the user in Preferences. Refer to "Reading and Changing the Printer Preferences Settings " if you want to change to density of the printout. (Or any other setting for that matter.) SPECIAL_FULLCOLS The width is set to the maximum possible, as determined by the printer or the configuration limits. SPECIAL_FULLROWS The height is set to the maximum possible, as determined by the printer or the configuration limits. SPECIAL_FRACCOLS Informs the printer device that the value in io_DestCols is to be taken as a longword binary fraction of the maximum for the dimension. For example, if io_DestCols is 0x8000, the width would be 1/2 (0x8000 / 0xffff) of the width of the paper. SPECIAL_FRACROWS Informs the printer device that the value in io_DestRows is to be taken as a longword binary fraction for the dimension. SPECIAL_MILCOLS Informs the printer device that the value in io_DestCols is specified in thousandths of an inch. For example, if io_DestCols is 8000, the width of the printout would be 8.000 inches. SPECIAL_MILROWS Informs the printer device that the value in io_DestRows is specified in thousandths of an inch. The flags are defined in the include file devices/ printer.h .
