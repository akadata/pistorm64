A / IFF Source Code / IFF Include Files ]" border=0> This section contains a variety of source code listings showing how to use IFF files in applications. All of these programs require the new iffparse.library inluded with Release 2.0 of the Amiga operating system (Kickstart V36 and greater). There are four parts: * IFF Include Files. These have been updated to be compatible with the iffparse.library. * Link modules which provide convenient IFF handling routines such as showilbm.c. * Example programs showing how to use the link modules. * Stand-alone utility and example programs.
