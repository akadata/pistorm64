TITLE: 11 SCSI Device / SCSI-Direct

11 SCSI Device / SCSI-Direct ]" border=0> SCSI-direct is the facility of the Amiga's SCSI device interface that allows low-level SCSI commands to be passed directly to a SCSI unit on the bus. This makes it possible to support the special features of tape drives, hard disks and other SCSI equipment that do not fit into the Amiga's normal I/O model. For example, with SCSI-direct, special commands can be sent to hard drives to modify various drive parameters that are normally inaccessible or which differ from drive to drive. In order to use SCSI-direct, you must first open the SCSI device for the unit you want to use in the manner described above. You then send an HD_SCSICMD I/O request with a pointer to a SCSI command data structure. The SCSI device uses a special data structure for SCSI-direct commands named SCSICmd. struct SCSICmd { UWORD *scsi_Data; /* word aligned data for SCSI Data Phase */ /* (optional) data need not be byte aligned */ /* (optional) data need not be bus accessible */ ULONG scsi_Length; /* even length of Data area */ /* (optional) data can have odd length */ /* (optional) data length can be > 2**24 */ ULONG scsi_Actual; /* actual Data used */ UBYTE *scsi_Command; /* SCSI Command (same options as scsi_Data) */ UWORD scsi_CmdLength; /* length of Command */ UWORD scsi_CmdActual; /* actual Command used */ UBYTE scsi_Flags; /* includes intended data direction */ UBYTE scsi_Status; /* SCSI status of command */ UBYTE *scsi_SenseData; /* sense data: filled if SCSIF_[OLD]AUTOSENSE */ /* is set and scsi_Status has CHECK CONDITION */ /* (bit 1) set */ UWORD scsi_SenseLength;/* size of scsi_SenseData, also bytes to */ /* request w/ SCSIF_AUTOSENSE, must be 4..255 */ UWORD scsi_SenseActual;/* amount actually fetched (0 = no sense) */ }; See the include file devices/ scsidisk.h for the complete structure definition. SCSICmd will contain the SCSI command and any associated data that you wish to pass to the SCSI unit. You set its fields to the values required by the unit and the command. When you have opened the SCSI device and set the SCSICmd to the proper values, you are ready for SCSI-direct. You send a SCSI-direct command by passing an IOStdReq to the SCSI device with a pointer to the SCSICmd structure set in io_Data, the size of the SCSICmd structure set in io_Length and HD_SCSICMD set in io_Command.: struct IOStdReq *SCSIreq = NULL; struct SCSICmd Cmd; /* where the actual SCSI command goes */ SCSIreq->io_Length = sizeof(struct SCSICmd); SCSIreq->io_Data = (APTR)&Cmd; SCSIreq->io_Command = HD_SCSICMD; DoIO(SCSIreq); The SCSICmd structure must be filled in prior to passing it to the SCSI unit. How it is filled in depends on the SCSI-direct being passed to the unit. Below is an example of setting up a SCSICmd structure for the MODE_SENSE SCSI-direct command. UBYTE *buffer; /* a data buffer used for mode sense data */ UBYTE Sense[20]; /* buffer for request sense data */ struct SCSICmd Cmd; /* where the actual SCSI command goes */ /* the command being sent */ static UBYTE ModeSense[]={ 0x1a,0,0xff,0,254,0 }; Cmd.scsi_Data = (UWORD *)buffer; /* where we put mode sense data */ Cmd.scsi_Length = 254; /* how much we will accept */ Cmd.scsi_CmdLength = 6; /* length of the command */ Cmd.scsi_Flags = SCSIF_AUTOSENSE | /* do automatic REQUEST_SENSE */ SCSIF_READ; /* set expected data direction */ Cmd.scsi_SenseData = (UBYTE *)Sense; /* where sense data will go */ Cmd.scsi_SenseLength = 18; /* how much we will accept */ Cmd.scsi_SenseActual = 0; /* how much has been received */ Cmd.scsi_Command=(UBYTE *)ModeSense; /* issuing a MODE_SENSE command */ The fields of the SCSICmd are: scsi_data This field points to the data buffer for the SCSI data phase (if any is expected).It is generally the job of the driver software to ensure that the given buffer is DMA-accessible and to drop to programmed I/O if it isn't. The filing system provides a stop-gap fix for non-conforming drivers with the AddressMask parameter in DEVS:mountlist. For absolute safety, restrict all direct reads and writes to Chip RAM. scsi_Length This is the expected length of data to be transferred. If an unknown amount of data is to be transferred from target to host, set the scsi_Length to be larger than the maximum amount of data expected. Some controllers explicitly use scsi_Length as the amount of data to transfer. The A2091, A590 and A3000 drivers always do programmed I/O for data transfers under 256 bytes or when the DMA chip doesn't support the required alignment. scsi_Actual How much data was actually received from or sent to the SCSI unit in response to the SCSI-direct command. scsi_Command The SCSI-direct command. scsi_CmdLength The length of the SCSI-direct command in bytes. scsi_CmdActual The actual number of bytes of the SCSI-direct command that were transferred to the SCSI unit. scsi_Flags These flags contain the intended data direction for the SCSI command. It is not strictly necessary to set the data direction flag since the SCSI protocol will inform the driver which direction data transfers will be going. However, some controllers use this information to set up DMA before issuing the command . It can also be used as a sanity check in case the data phase goes the wrong way. One flag in particular, is worth noting. SCSIF_AUTOSENSE is used to make the driver perform an automatic REQUEST SENSE if the target returns CHECK CONDITION for a SCSI command. The reason for having the driver do this is the multitasking nature of the Amiga.If two tasks were accessing the same drive and the first received a CHECK CONDITION, the second task would destroy the sense information when it sent a command. SCSIF_AUTOSENSE prevents the caller from having to make two I/O requests and removes this window of vulnerability. scsi_Status The status of the SCSI-direct command. The values returned in this field can be found in the SCSI specification. For example, 2 is CHECK_CONDITION. scsi_SenseActual If the SCSIF_AUTOSENSE flag is set, it is important to initialize this field to zero before issuing a SCSI command because some drivers don't support AUTOSENSE and won't initialize the field. scsi_SenseData This field is used only for SCSIF_AUTOSENSE. If a REQUEST SENSE command is directly sent to the driver, the data will be deposited in the buffer pointed to by scsi_Data. Keep in mind that SCSI-direct is geared toward an initiator role so it can't be expected to perform target-like operations. You can only send commands to a device, not receive them from an initiator. There is no provision for SCSI messaging, either. This is due mainly to the interactive nature of the extended messages (such as synchronous transfer requests) which have to be handled by the driver because it knows the limitations of the controller card and has to be made aware of such protocol changes.
