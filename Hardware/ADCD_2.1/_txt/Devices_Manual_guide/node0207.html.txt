A / IFF Third Party Public Form and Chunk Specification / 8SVX.CHAN.PAN.doc ]" border=0> Stereo chunks for 8SVX form SMUS.CHAN and SMUS.PAN Chunks Stereo imaging in the "8SVX" IFF 8-bit Sample Voice --------------------------------------------------- Registered by David Jones, Gold Disk Inc. There are two ways to create stereo imaging when playing back a digitized sound. The first relies on the original sound being created with a stereo sampler: two different samples are digitized simultaneously, using right and left inputs. To play back this type of sample while maintaining the stereo imaging, both channels must be set to the same volume. The second type of stereo sound plays the identical information on two different channels at different volumes. This gives the sample an absolute position in the stereo field. Unfortunately, there are currently a number of methods for doing this currently implemented on the Amiga, none truly adhering to any type of standard. What I have tried to to is provide a way of doing this consistently, while retaining compatibility with existing (non-standard) systems. Introduced below are two optional data chunks, CHAN and PAN. CHAN deals with sounds sampled in stereo, and PAN with samples given stereo characteristics after the fact. Optional Data Chunk CHAN Optional Data Chunk PAN [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
