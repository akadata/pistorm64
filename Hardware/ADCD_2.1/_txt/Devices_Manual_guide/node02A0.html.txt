SAMP.doc / Why Does Anyone Need Such a Complicated File? ]" border=0> (or "What's wrong with 8SVX anyway?") In a nutshell, 8SVX is not adequate for professional music sampling. First of all, it is nearly impossible to use multi-sampling (utilizing several, different samples of any instrument throughout its musical range). This very reason alone makes it impossible to realistically reproduce a musical in- strument, as none in existance (aside from an electronic organ) uses inter- polations of a single wave to create its musical note range. Also, stretching a sample out over an entire octave range does grotesque (and VERY unmusical) things to such elements as the overtone structure, wind/percussive noises, the instrument's amplitude envelope, etc. The 8SVX format is designed to stretch the playback in exactly this manner. 8SVX ignores MIDI which is the de facto standard of musical data transmission. 8SVX does not allow storing data for features that are commonplace to pro- fessional music samplers. Such features are: velocity sample start, separate filter and envelopes for each sample, separate sampling rates, and various playback modes like stereo sampling and panning. SAMP attempts to remedy all of these problems with a format that can be used by a program that simulates these professional features in software. The format was inspired by the capabilities of the following musical products: EMU's EMAX, EMULATOR SEQUENTIAL CIRCUIT's PROPHET 2000, STUDIO 440 ENSONIQ's MIRAGE CASIO's FZ-1 OBERHEIM's DPX YAMAHA TX series So why does the Amiga need the SAMP format? Because professional musician's are buying computers. With the firm establishment of MIDI, musician's are buying and using a variety of sequencers, patch editors, and scoring programs. It is now common knowledge amoung professional musicians that the Amiga lags far behind IBM clones, Macintosh, and Atari ST computers in both music software and hardware support. Both Commodore and the current crop of short- sighted 3rd party Amiga developers are pigeon-holing the Amiga as "a video computer". It is important for music software to exploit whatever capabili- ties the Amiga offers before the paint and animation programs, genlocks, frame-grabbers, and video breadboxes are the only applications selling for the Amiga. Hopefully, this format, with the SAMP disk I/O library will make it possible for Amiga software to attain the level of professionalism that the other machines now boast, and the Amiga lacks.
