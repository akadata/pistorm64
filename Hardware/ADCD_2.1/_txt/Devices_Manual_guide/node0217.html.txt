AIFF.doc / AIFF / Referring to Audio IFF ]" border=0> The official name for this standard is Audio Interchange File Format. If an application program needs to present the name of this format to a user, such as in a "Save As..." dialog box, the name can be abbreviated to Audio IFF. Referring to Audio IFF files by a four-letter abbreviation (i.e., 'AIFF') in user-level documentation or program-generated messages should be avoided. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
