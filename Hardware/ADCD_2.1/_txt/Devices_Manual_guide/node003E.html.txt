TITLE: Amiga® RKM Devices: 10 Printer Device

Amiga® RKM Devices: 10 Printer Device ]" border=0> The printer device offers a way of sending configuration-independent output to a printer attached to the Amiga. It can be thought of as a filter: it takes standard commands as input and translates them into commands understood by the printer. The commands sent to the printer are defined in a specific printer driver program. For each type of printer in use, a driver (or the driver of a compatible printer) should be present in the devs:printers directory.
