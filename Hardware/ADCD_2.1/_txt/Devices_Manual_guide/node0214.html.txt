AIFF.doc / AIFF / Data Types ]" border=0> A C-like language will be used to describe the data structures in this document The data types used are listed below. char: 8 bits signed. A char can contain more than just ASCII characters. It can contain any number from -128 to 127 (inclusive). unsigned char: 8 bits signed. Contains numbers from 0 to 255 (inclusive). short: 16 bits signed. Contains any number from -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive). unsigned short:16 bits unsigned. Contains any number from 0 to 65,535 (inclusive). long: 32 bits signed. Contains any number from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (inclusive). unsigned long: 32 bits unsigned. Contains any number from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (inclusive). extended: 80 bit IEEE Standard 754 floating point number (Standard Apple Numeric Environment [SANE] data type Extended) pstring: Pascal-style string, a one-byte count followed by text bytes. The total number of bytes in this data type should be even. A pad byte can be added to the end of the text to accomplish this. This pad byte is not reflected in the count. ID: 32 bits,the concatenation of four printable ASCII characters in the range ' ' (space, 0x20) through '~' (tilde, 0x7E). Leading spaces are not allowed in the ID but trailing spaces are OK. Control characters are forbidden. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
