A / IFF Third Party Public Form and Chunk Specification / TDDD.doc ]" border=0> 3-D rendering data, Turbo Silver (Impulse) FORM TDDD --------- FORM TDDD is used by Impulse's Turbo Silver 3.0 for 3D rendering data. TDDD stands for "3D data description". The files contain object and (optionally) observer data. Turbo Silver's successor, "Imagine", uses an upgraded FORM TDDD when it reads/writes object data. Currently, in "standard IFF" terms, a FORM TDDD has only two chunk types: an INFO chunk describing observer data; and an OBJ chunk describing an object heirarchy. The INFO chunk appears only in Turbo Silver's "cell" files, and the OBJ chunk appears in both "cell" files and "object" files. The FORM has an (optional) INFO chunk followed by some number of OBJ chunks. (Note: OBJ is followed by a space - ckID = "OBJ ") The INFO and OBJ chunks, in turn, are made up of smaller chunks with the standard IFF structure: . The INFO "sub-chunks" are relatively straightforward to interpret. The OBJ "sub-chunks" support object heirarchies, and are slightly more difficult to interpret. Currently, there are 3 types of OBJ sub-chunks: an EXTR chunk, describing an "external" object in a seperate file; a DESC chunk, describing one node of a heirarchy; and a TOBJ chunk marking the end of a heirarchy chain. For each DESC chunk, there must be a corresponding TOBJ chunk. And an EXTR chunk is equivalent to a DESC/TOBJ pair. In Turbo Silver and Imagine, the structure of the object heirarchy is as follows. There is a head object, and its (sexist) brothers. Each brother may have child objects. The children may have grandchildren, and so on. The brother nodes are kept in a doubly linked list, and each node has a (possibly NULL) pointer to a doubly linked "child" list. The children point to the "grandchildren" lists, and so on. (In addition, each node has a "back" pointer to its parent). Each of the "head" brothers is written in a seperate OBJ chunk, along with all its descendants. The descendant heirarchy is supported as follows: for each node of a doubly linked list, 1) A DESC chunk is written, describing its object. 2) If it has children, steps 1) to 3) are performed for each child. 3) A TOBJ chunk is written, marking the end of the children. For "external" objects, steps 1) to 3) are not performed, but an EXTR chunk is written instead. (This means that an external object cannot have children unless they are stored in the same "external" file). The TOBJ sub-chunks have zero size -- and no data. The DESC and EXTR sub-chunks are made up of "sub-sub-chunks", again, with the standard IFF structure: . ( "External" objects were used by Turbo Silver to allow a its "cell" data files to refer to an "object" data file that is "external" to the cell file. Imagine abandons the idea of individual cell files, and deals only in TDDD "object" files. Currently, Imagine does not support EXTR chunks in TDD files.) Reader software WILL FOLLOW the standard IFF procedure of skipping over any un-recognized chunks -- and "sub-chunks" or "sub-sub-chunks". The field indicates how many bytes to skip. In addition it WILL OBSERVE the IFF rule that an odd may appear, in which case the corredponding field will be padded at the end with one extra byte to give it an even size. Now, on with the details [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
