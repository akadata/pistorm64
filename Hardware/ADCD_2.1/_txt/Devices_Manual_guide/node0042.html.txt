10 / Printer Device Access / Writing To Prt: ]" border=0> Once you've opened it, you can print by calling the AmigaDOS Write() standard I/O routine. actual_length = Write(file, dataLocation, length); where file is a file handle. dataLocation is a pointer to the first character in the output stream you wish to write. This stream can contain the standard escape sequences as shown in the command table below. The printer command aRAW (see the Printer Device Command Functions table below) can be used in the stream if character translation is not desired. length is the length of the output stream. actual_length is the actual length of the write. For the printer device, if there are no errors, this will be the same as the length of write requested. The only exception is if you specify a value of -1 for length. In this case, -1 for length means that a null (0) terminated stream is being written to the printer device. The device returns the count of characters written prior to encountering the null. If it returns a value of -1 in actual_length, there has been an error. -1 = STOP! ---------- If a -1 is returned by Write() , do not do any additional printing. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
