TITLE: 14 / Diagnostics and Repair / Moving The Drive Head To A Specific Track

14 / Diagnostics and Repair / Moving The Drive Head To A Specific Track ]" border=0> You move the drive head to a specific track by passing an IOExtTD to the device with TD_SEEK or ETD_SEEK set in io_Command, and io_Offset set to the byte offset of the track to which the seek is to occur. DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Offset = (ULONG)(TRACK_SIZE * track); DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Command = TD_SEEK; DoIO((struct IORequest *)DiskIO); Seeking is not Reading. ----------------------- TD_SEEK and ETD_SEEK do not verify their position until the next read. That is, they only move the heads; they do not actually read any data. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
