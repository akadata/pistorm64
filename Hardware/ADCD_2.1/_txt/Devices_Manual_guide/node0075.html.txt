TITLE: 11 SCSI Device / Device Interface

11 SCSI Device / Device Interface ]" border=0> The SCSI device operates like other Amiga devices. To use it, you must first open the SCSI device, then send I/O requests to it, and then close it when finished. See the " Introduction to Amiga System Devices " chapter for general information on device usage. The power of the SCSI device comes from its special facility for passing SCSI and SCSI-2 command blocks to any SCSI unit on the bus. This facility is commonly called SCSI-direct and it allows the Amiga to perform SCSI functions that are "non-standard" in terms of the normal Amiga I/O model. To send SCSI-direct or other commands to the SCSI device, an extended I/O request structure named IOStdReq is used. struct IOStdReq { struct Message io_Message; struct Device *io_Device;/* device node pointer */ struct Unit *io_Unit; /* unit (driver private)*/ UWORD io_Command; /* device command */ UBYTE io_Flags; BYTE io_Error; /* error or warning num */ ULONG io_Actual; /* actual number of bytes transferred */ ULONG io_Length; /* requested number bytes transferred*/ APTR io_Data; /* points to data area */ ULONG io_Offset; /* offset for block structured devices */ }; See the include file exec/ io.h for the complete structure definition.
