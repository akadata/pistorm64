TITLE: FTXT IFF Formatted / Standard Data and Property Chunks

FTXT IFF Formatted / Standard Data and Property Chunks ]" border=0> The main contents of a FORM FTXT is in its character stream " CHRS " chunks. Formatting property chunks may also appear. The only formatting property yet defined is " FONS ", a font specifier. A FORM FTXT with no CHRS represents an empty text stream. A FORM FTXT may contain nested IFF FORM s, LIST s, or CAT s, although a "stripping" reader (see section 3) will ignore them.
