RGBN-RGB8.doc / RGBN BODY Chunk ]" border=0> For each RGB value, a WORD (16-bits) is written: with the 12 RGB bits in the MSB (most significant bit) positions; the "genlock" bit next; and then a 3 bit repeat count. If the repeat count is greater than 7, the 3-bit count is zero, and a BYTE repeat count follows. If the repeat count is greater than 255, the BYTE count is zero, and a WORD repeat count follows. Repeat counts greater than 65536 are not supported. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
