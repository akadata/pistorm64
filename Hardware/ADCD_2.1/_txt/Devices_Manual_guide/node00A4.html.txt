12 / / Ending A Read Or Write Using Termination Characters ]" border=0> Reads and writes from the serial device may terminate early if an error occurs or if an end-of-file (EOF) is sensed. For example, if a break is detected on the line, any current read request will be returned with the error SerErr_DetectedBreak. The count of characters read to that point will be in the io_Actual field of the request. You can specify a set of possible end-of-file characters that the serial device is to look for in the input stream or output using the SDCDMD_SETPARAMS command. These are contained in an io_TermArray that you provide. io_TermArray is used only when the SERF_EOFMODE flag is selected (see the Serial Flags section below). If EOF mode is selected, each input data character read into or written from the user's data block is compared against those in io_TermArray. If a match is found, the IOExtSer is terminated as complete, and the count of characters transferred (including the termination character) is stored in io_Actual. To keep this search overhead as efficient as possible, the serial device requires that the array of characters be in descending order. The array has eight bytes and all must be valid (that is, do not pad with zeros unless zero is a valid EOF character). Fill to the end of the array with the lowest value termination character. When making an arbitrary choice of EOF character(s), you will get the quickest response from the lowest value(s) available. Terminate_Serial.c The read will terminate before the io_Length number of characters is read if a "Q", "E", ETX, or EOT is detected in the serial input stream. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
