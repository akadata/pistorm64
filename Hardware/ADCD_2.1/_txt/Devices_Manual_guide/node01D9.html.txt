Primitive Data Types / Numbers ]" border=0> Numeric types supported are two's complement binary integers in the format used by the MC68000 processor - high byte first, high word first - the reverse of 8088 and 6502 format. UBYTE 8 bits unsigned WORD 16 bits signed UWORD 16 bits unsigned LONG 32 bits signed The actual type definitions depend on the CPU and the compiler. In this document, we'll express data type definitions in the C programming language. [See C, A Reference Manual.] In 68000 Lattice C: typedef unsigned char UBYTE; /* 8 bits unsigned */ typedef short WORD; /* 16 bits signed */ typedef unsigned short UWORD; /* 16 bits unsigned */ typedef long LONG; /* 32 bits signed */ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
