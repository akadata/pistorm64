ILBM.CLUT.doc / CLUT Example ]" border=0> Normally, the CLUT chunk will appear after the BMHD of an FORM ILBM before the BODY chunk, in the same "section" as CMAPs are normally found. However, a FORM may contain only CLUTs with no other supporting information. As a general guideline, it is desirable to group all CLUTs together in a form without other chunk types between them. If you were using CLUTs to store RGB intensity corrections, you would write three CLUTs in a row, R, G, then B. Here is a box diagram for a 320x200x8 image stored as an IFF ILBM with a single CLUT chunk for intensity mapping: +-----------------------------------+ |'FORM' 64284 | FORM 64284 ILBM +-----------------------------------+ |'ILBM' | +-----------------------------------+ | +-------------------------------+ | | | 'BMHD' 20 | | .BMHD 20 | | 320, 200, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, ... | | | | ------------------------------+ | | | 'CLUT' 264 | | .CLUT 264 | | 0, 0, 0; 32, 0, 0; 64,0,0; .. | | | +-------------------------------+ | | +-------------------------------+ | | |'BODY' 64000 | | .BODY 64000 | |0, 0, 0, ... | | | +-------------------------------+ | +-----------------------------------+ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
