Chunk Formats / DLTA Chunk / Format for method 4 ]" border=0> The DLTA chunk is modified slightly to have 16 long pointers at the start. The first 8 are as before - pointers to the start of the data for each of the bitplanes (up to a theoretical max of 8 planes). The next 8 are pointers to the start of the offset/numbers data list. If there is only one list of offset/numbers for all planes, then the pointer to that list is repeated in all positions so the playback code need not even be aware of it. In fact, one could get fancy and have some bitplanes share lists while others have different lists, or no lists (the problems in these schemes lie in the generation, not in the playback). The best way to show the use of this format is in a sample playback routine.
