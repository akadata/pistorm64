Standard Data and Property Chunks / Set Instrument SEvent ]" border=0> One of the running state variables of every track is an instrument number. An instrument number is the array index of an "instrument register", which in turn points to an instrument. (See " Instrument Registers ", in section 2.) This is like a color number in a bitmap; a reference to a color through a "color register". The initial setting for each track's instrument number is the track number. Track 1 is set to instrument 1, etc. Each time the score is played, every track's instrument number should be reset to the track number. The SEvent SID_Instrument changes the instrument number for a track, that is, which instrument plays the following notes. Its SEvent.data field is an instrument register number in the range 0 through 255. If a program doesn't implement the SID_Instrument event, each track is fixed to one instrument.
