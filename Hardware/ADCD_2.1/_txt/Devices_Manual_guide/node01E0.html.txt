TITLE: Primitive Data Types / Links

Primitive Data Types / Links ]" border=0> Issue: A standard mechanism for "links" or "cross references" is very desirable for things like combining images and sounds into animations. Perhaps we'll define "link" chunk within FORM s that refer to other FORMs or to specific chunks within the same and other FORMs. This needs further work. EA IFF 1985 has no standard link mechanism. For now, it may suffice to read a list of, say, musical instruments, and then just refer to them within a musical score by sequence number. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
