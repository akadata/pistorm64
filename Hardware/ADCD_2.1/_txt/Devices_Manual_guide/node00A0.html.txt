12 / Device Interface / Closing The Serial Device ]" border=0> Each OpenDevice() must eventually be matched by a call to CloseDevice() . When the last close is performed, the device will deallocate all resources and buffers. All IORequests must be complete before CloseDevice() . Abort any pending requests with AbortIO() . if (!(CheckIO(SerialIO))) { AbortIO((struct IORequest *)SerialIO); /* Ask device to abort */ } /* request, if pending */ WaitIO((struct IORequest *)SerialIO); /* Wait for abort, then */ CloseDevice((struct IORequest *)SerialIO); /* clean up */ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
