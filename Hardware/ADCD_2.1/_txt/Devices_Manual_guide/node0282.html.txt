A range should only have the RNG_ACTIVE if it: 1> contains at least one color register 2> has a defined rate 3> has more than one color and/or color register If the above conditions are met then RNG_ACTIVE is a user/program preference. If the bit is NOT set the program should NOT cycle the range. The RNG_DP_RESERVED flags should always be 0!!! typedef struct { UBYTE min; /* min cell value */ UBYTE max; /* max cell value */ SHORT rate; /* color cycling rate, 16384 = 60 steps/second */ SHORT flags; /* 1=RNG_ACTIVE,4=RNG_DP_RESERVED */ UBYTE ntrue; /* number of DColor structs to follow */ UBYTE nregs; /* number of DIndex structs to follow */ } DRange; typedef struct { UBYTE cell; UBYTE r,g,b; } DColor; /* true color cell */ typedef struct { UBYTE cell; UBYTE index; } DIndex; /* color register cell */ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
