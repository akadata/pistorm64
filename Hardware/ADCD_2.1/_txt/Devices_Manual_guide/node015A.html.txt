TITLE: Amiga® RKM Devices: Appendix C : Floppy Boot Process and Physical Layout

Amiga® RKM Devices: Appendix C : Floppy Boot Process and Physical Layout ]" border=0> The first two sectors on each floppy disk contain special boot information. These sectors are read into the system at an arbitrary position; therefore, the code must be position independent. The first three longwords come from the include file devices/bootblock.h. The type must be BBID_DOS; the checksum must be correct (an additive carry wraparound sum of 0xffffffff). Execution starts at location 12 of the first sector read in. The code is called with an open trackdisk.device I/O request pointer in A1 (see the ``Trackdisk'' chapter for more information). The boot code is free to use the IO request as it wishes (the code may trash A1, but must not trash the I/O request itself). The boot code must return values in two registers: D0 and A0. D0 is a failure code - if it is non-zero then a system alert will be called, and the system will reboot. If D0 is zero then A0 must contain the start address to jump to. The strap module will free the boot sector memory, free the boot picture memory, close the trackdisk.device I/O request, do any other cleanup that is required, then jump to the location pointed to by A0. Boot code may allocate memory, use trackdisk.device to load relocatable information into the memory, then return with D0=0 and A0 pointing to code. The system will clean up, then call the code.
