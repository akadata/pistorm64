4 / About Console I/O / Console Keyboard Input ]" border=0> If you read from the console device, the keyboard inputs are preprocessed for you and you will get ASCII characters, such as "B." Most normal text-gathering programs will read from the console device in this manner. Some programs may also ask to receive raw events in their console stream. Keypresses are converted to ASCII characters or CSI sequences via the keymap associated with the unit. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
