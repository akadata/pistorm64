TITLE: 2 / ADCMD_ALLOCATE / The ADIOF_NOWAIT Flag

2 / ADCMD_ALLOCATE / The ADIOF_NOWAIT Flag ]" border=0> If you need to produce a sound right now and otherwise don't want to allocate, set the ADIOF_NOWAIT flag to 1. This will cause the command to return an IOERR_ALLOCFAILED error if it cannot allocate any of the channels. If you are producing a non-urgent sound and you can wait, set the ADIOF_NOWAIT flag to 0. Then, the IOAudio block returns only when you get the allocation. If ADIOF_NOWAIT is set to 0, the audio device will continue to retry the allocation request whenever channels are freed until it is successful. If the program decides to cancel the request, AbortIO() can be used. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
