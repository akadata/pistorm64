AIFF.doc / AIFF / Block-Aligning Sound Data ]" border=0> There may be some applications that, to ensure real time recording and playback of audio, wish to align sampled sound data with fixed-size blocks. This alignment can be accomplished with the offset and blockSize parameters of the Sound Data Chunk, as shown in Figure 7. ____________ __________________________________ ____________ |\\ unused \\| sample frames |\\ unused \\| |____________|__________________________________|____________| | blockSize | | | | | | | | | |_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________| block N-1 block N block N+1 block N+2 Figure 7: Block-Aligned Sound Data In Figure 7, the first sample frame starts at the beginning of block N. This is accomplished by skipping the first offset bytes of the soundData. Note too, that the soundData bytes can extend beyond valid sample frames, allowing the soundData bytes to end on a block boundary as well. The blockSize specifies the size in bytes of the block to which you would align the sound data. A blockSize of zero indicates that the sound data does not need to be block-aligned. Applications that don't care about block alignment should set the blockSize and offset to zero when creating Audio IFF files. Applications that write block-aligned sound data should set blockSize to the appropriate block size. Applications that modify an existing Audio IFF file should try to preserve alignment of the sound data, although this is not required. If an application does not preserve alignment, it should set the blockSize and offset to zero. If an application needs to realign sound data to a different sized block, it should update blockSize and offset accordingly. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
