TITLE: SAMP.doc / The BODY Chunk

SAMP.doc / The BODY Chunk ]" border=0> The "BODY" chunk is CONSIDERABLY different than the "8SVX" form. Like all chunks it has an ID. #define ID_BODY MakeID('B','O','D','Y') Every wave has an 80 byte waveHeader, followed by its data. The waveHeader structure is as follows: typedef struct { ULONG WaveSize; /* total # of BYTES in the wave (MUST be even) */ UWORD MidiSampNum; /* ONLY USED for Midi Dumps */ UBYTE LoopType, /* ONLY USED for Midi Dumps */ InsType; /* Used for searching for a certain instrument */ ULONG Period, /* in nanoseconds at original pitch */ Rate, /* # of samples per second at original pitch */ LoopStart, /* an offset in BYTES (from the beginning of the of the wave) where the looping portion of the wave begins. Set to WaveSize if no loop. */ LoopEnd; /* an offset in BYTES (from the beginning of the of the wave) where the looping portion of the wave ends. Set to WaveSize if no loop. */ UBYTE RootNote, /* the Midi Note # that plays back orig. pitch */ VelStart; /* 0 = NO velocity effect, 128 = negative direction, 64 = positive direction (it must be one of these 3) */ UWORD VelTable[16]; /* contains 16 successive offset values in BYTES from the beginning of the wave */ /* The ATAK and RLSE segments contain an EGPoint[] piece-wise linear envelope just like 8SVX. The structure of an EGPoint[] is the same as 8SVX. See that document for details. */ ULONG ATAKsize, /* # of BYTES in subsequent ATAK envelope. If 0, then no ATAK data for this wave. */ RLSEsize, /* # of BYTES in subsequent RLSE envelope If 0, then no RLSE envelope follows */ /* The FATK and FRLS segments contain an EGPoint[] piece-wise linear envelope for filtering purposes. This is included in the hope that future Amiga audio will incorporate a VCF (Voltage Controlled Filter). Until then, if you are doing any non-realtime digital filtering, you could store info here. */ sizeOfFATK, /* # of BYTES in FATK segment */ sizeOfFRLS, /* # of BYTES in FRLS segment */ USERsize; /* # of BYTES in the following data segment (not including USERtype). If zero, then no user data */ UWORD USERtype; /* See explanation below. If USERsize = 0, then ignore this. */ /* End of the waveHeader. */ /* The data for any ATAK, RLSE, FATK, FRLS, USER, and the actual wave data for wave #1 follows in this order: Now list each EGPoint[] (if any) for the VCA's (Voltage Controlled Amp) attack portion. Now list each EGPoint[] for the VCA's (Voltage Controlled Amp) release portion. List EGPoints[] (if any) for FATK. List EGPoints[] if any for FRLS */ /* Now include the user data here if there is any.Just pad it out to an even number of bytes and have USERsize reflect that. Finally,here is the actual sample data for the wave. The size (in BYTES) of this data is WaveSize. It MUST be padded out to an even number of bytes. */ } WaveFormInfo; /* END OF WAVE #1 */ /* The waveHeader and data for the next wave would now follow. It is the same form as the first wave */ In assembly, the BODY chunk looks like this: CNOP 0,2 BodyHEADER dc.b 'BODY' sizeOfBody dc.l [total bytes in the BODY chunk not counting 8 byte header] ; Now for the first wave WaveSize dc.l ;[total # of BYTES in this wave (MUST be even)] MidiSampNum dc.w ;[from Midi Sample Dump] ; ONLY USED for Midi Dumps LoopType dc.b ;[0 or 1] ; ONLY USED for Midi Dumps InsType dc.b 0 Period dc.l ;[period in nanoseconds at original pitch] Rate dc.l ;[# of samples per second at original pitch] LoopStart dc.l ;[an offset in BYTES (from the beginning of the ; of the wave) to where the looping ; portion of the wave begins.] LoopEnd dc.l ;[an offset in BYTES (from the beginning of the ; of the wave) to where the looping ; portion of the wave ends] RootNote dc.b ;[the Midi Note # that plays back original pitch] VelStart dc.b ;[0, 64, or 128] VelTable dc.w ;[first velocity offset] dc.w ;[second velocity offset]...etc ds.w 14 ;...for a TOTAL of 16 velocity offsets ATAKsize dc.l ;# of BYTES in subsequent ATAK envelope. ;If 0, then no ATAK data for this wave.
