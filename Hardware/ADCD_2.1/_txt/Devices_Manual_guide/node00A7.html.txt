TITLE: 12 / Setting Serial Parameters / Serial Flags (Bits For io_SerFlags)

12 / Setting Serial Parameters / Serial Flags (Bits For io_SerFlags) ]" border=0> There are additional serial device parameters which are controlled by flags set in the io_SerFlags field of the IOExtSer structure. The default state of all of these flags is zero. SERF_SHARED and SERF_7WIRE must always be set before OpenDevice() . The flags are defined in the include file serial.h . SERIAL FLAGS (IO_SERFLAGS) Flag Name Effect on Device Operation -------- --------------------------- SERF_XDISABLED Disable the XON/XOFF feature. XON/XOFF must be disabled during XModem transfers. SERF_EOFMODE Set this bit if you want the serial device to check input characters against io_TermArray and to terminate the read immediately if an end-of-file character has been encountered. Note: this bit may be set and reset directly in the user's IOExtSer without a call to SDCMD_SETPARAMS . SERF_SHARED Set this bit if you want to allow other tasks to simultaneously access the serial port. The default is exclusive-access. Any number of tasks may have shared access. Only one task may have exclusive access. If someone already has the port for exclusive access, your OpenDevice() call will fail. This flag must be set before OpenDevice(). SERF_RAD_BOOGIE If set, this bit activates high-speed mode. Certain peripheral devices (MIDI, for example) require high serial throughput. Setting this bit high causes the serial device to skip certain of its internal checking code to speed throughput. Use SERF_RAD_BOOGIE only when you have: * Disabled parity checking * Disabled XON/XOFF handling * Use 8-bit character length * Do not wish a test for a break signal Note that the Amiga is a multitasking system and has immediate processing of software interrupts. If there are other tasks running, it is possible that the serial driver may be unable to keep up with high data transfer rates, even with this bit set. SERF_QUEUEDBRK If set, every break command that you transmit will be enqueued. This means that all commands will be executed on a FIFO (first in, first out) basis. If this bit is cleared (the default), a break command takes immediate precedence over any serial output already enqueued. When the break command has finished, the interrupted request will continue (if not aborted by the user). SERF_7WIRE If set at OpenDevice() time, the serial device will use seven-wire handshaking for RS-232-C communications. Default is three-wire (pins 2, 3, and 7). SERF_PARTY_ODD If set, selects odd parity. If clear, selects even parity. SERF_PARTY_ON If set, parity usage and checking is enabled. Also see the SERF_MSPON bit described under io_ExtFlags above.
