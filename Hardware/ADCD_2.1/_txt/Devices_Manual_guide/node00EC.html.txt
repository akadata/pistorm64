TITLE: 14 / Disk Status Commands / Determining The Presence Of A Disk

14 / Disk Status Commands / Determining The Presence Of A Disk ]" border=0> You determine the presence of a disk in a drive by passing an IOExtTD to the device with TD_CHANGESTATE set in io_Command. For quick I/O, you must set io_Flags to IOF_QUICK. DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Flags = IOF_QUICK; DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Command = TD_CHANGESTATE; BeginIO((struct IORequest *)DiskIO); TD_CHANGESTATE returns the presence indicator of a disk in io_Actual. The value returned will be zero if a disk is currently in the drive and nonzero if the drive has no disk. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
