ILBM IFF Interleaved Bitmap / Appendix C. IFF Hints ]" border=0> Hints on ILBM files from Jerry Morrison, Oct 1988. How to avoid some pitfalls when reading ILBM files: * Don't ignore the BitMapHeader.masking field. A bitmap with a mask (such as a partially-transparent DPaint brush or a DPaint picture with a stencil) will read as garbage if you don't de-interleave the mask. * Don't assume all images are compressed. Narrow images aren't usually run-compressed since that would actually make them longer. * Don't assume a particular image size. You may encounter overscan pictures and PAL pictures. There's a better way to read a BODY than the example IFF code. The GetBODY routine should call a GetScanline routine once per scan line, which calls a GetRow routine for each bitplane in the file. This in turn calls a GetUnpackedBytes routine, which calls a GetBytes routine as needed and unpacks the result. (If the picture is uncompressed, GetRow calls GetBytes directly.) Since theunpacker knows how many packed bytes to read, this avoids juggling buffers for a memory-to-memory UnPackBytes routine. Caution: If you make many AmigaDOS calls to read or write a few bytes at a time, performance will be mud! AmigaDOS has a high overhead per call, even with RAM disk. So use buffered read/write routines.

When displaying on hardware which has less color resolution, just take the high order bits. For example, to convert ILBM's 8-bit Red to the Amiga's 4-bit Red, right shift the data by 4 bits (R4 := R8 >> 4). To convert hardware colors to ILBM colors, the ILBM specification says just set the high bits (R8 := R4 CGA and EGA subtleties 24-bit ILBMs [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
