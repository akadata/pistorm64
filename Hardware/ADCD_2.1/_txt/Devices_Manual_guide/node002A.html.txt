TITLE: 2 / Allocation and Arbitration Commands / ADCMD_ALLOCATE

2 / Allocation and Arbitration Commands / ADCMD_ALLOCATE ]" border=0> This command gives your program a channel to use and should be the first command you send to the audio device. You specify the channels you want by setting a pointer to an array in the ioa_Data field of the IOAudio structure. This array uses a value of 1 to allocate channel 0, 2 for channel 1, 4 for channel 2, and 8 for channel 3. For multiple channels, add the values together. For example, if you want to allocate all channels, use a value of 15. If you want a pair of stereo channels and you have no preference about which of the left and right channels the system will choose for the allocation, you can pass a pointer to an array containing 3, 5, 10, and 12. Channels 1 and 2 produce sound on the left side and channels 0 and 3 on the right side. The table below shows how this array corresponds to all the possible combinations of a right and a left channel.
