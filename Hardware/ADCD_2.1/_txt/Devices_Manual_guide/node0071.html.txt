3 / Monitoring Clipboard Changes / Caveats For CBD_CHANGEHOOK ]" border=0> * CBD_CHANGEHOOK should only be used by a special application, such as a clipboard viewing program. Most applications can check the contents of the clipboard when, and if, the user requests a paste. * Do not add system overhead by blindly reading and parsing the clipboard everytime a user copies data to it. If all applications did this, the system could become intolerably slow whenever an application wrote to the clipboard. Only read and parse when it is necessary. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
