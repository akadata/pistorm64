TITLE: 8 / Phonetic Spelling / Contractions and Special Symbols

8 / Phonetic Spelling / Contractions and Special Symbols ]" border=0> There are several phoneme combinations that appear very often in English words. Some of these are caused by our laziness in pronunciation. Take the word connector for example. The o in the first syllable is almost swallowed out of existence. You would not use the AA phoneme; you would use the AX phoneme instead. It is because of this relaxation of vowels that we find ourselves using AX and IX very often. Since this relaxation frequently occurs before l, m, and n, narrator has a shortcut for typing these combinations. Instead of personal being spelled PERSIXNAXL, we can spell it PERSINUL, making it a little more readable. Anomaly goes from AXNAAMAXLIY to UNAAMULIY, and KAAMBIXNEYSHIXN becomes KAAMBINEYSHIN for combination. It may be hard to decide whether to use the AX or IX brand of relaxed vowel. The only way to find out is to use both and see which sounds best. Other special symbols are used internally by narrator. Sometimes they are inserted into or substituted for part of your input sentence. You can type them in directly if you wish. The most useful is probably the Q or glottal stop, an interruption of air flow in the glottis. The word Atlantic has one between the t and the l. Narrator knows there should be a glottal stop there and saves you the trouble of typing it. But narrator is only close to perfect, so sometimes a word or word pair might slip by that would have sounded better with a Q stuck in someplace. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
