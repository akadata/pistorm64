5 Gameport Device / Gameport Device Commands and Functions ]" border=0> Command Operation ------- --------- CMD_CLEAR Clear the gameport input buffer. GPD_ASKCTYPE Return the type of gameport controller being used. GPD_ASKTRIGGER Return the conditions that have been preset for triggering. GPD_READEVENT Read one or more gameport events. GPD_SETCTYPE Set the type of the controller to be used. GPD_SETTRIGGER Preset the conditions that will trigger a gameport event. Exec Functions as Used in This Chapter -------------------------------------- AbortIO() Abort a command to the gameport device. CheckIO() Return the status of an I/O request. CloseDevice() Relinquish use of the gameport device. All requests must be complete before closing. DoIO() Initiate a command and wait for completion (synchronous request). OpenDevice() Obtain shared use of one unit of the gameport device. The unit number specified is placed in the I/O request structure for use by gameport commands. SendIO() Initiate a command and return immediately (asynchronous request). WaitIO() Wait for the completion of an asynchronous request. When the request is complete the message will be removed from reply port. Exec Support Functions as Used in This Chapter ---------------------------------------------- CreateExtIO() Create an extended I/O request structure of type IOStdReq . This structure will be used to communicate commands to the gameport device. CreatePort() Create a signal message port for reply messages from the gameport device. Exec will signal a task when a message arrives at the port. DeleteExtIO() Delete an I/O request structure created by CreateExtIO() . DeletePort() Delete the message port created by CreatePort() . Who Runs The Mouse? ------------------- When the input device or Intution is operating, unit 0 is usually dedicated to gathering mouse events. The input device uses the gameport device to read the mouse events. (For applications that take over the machine without starting up the input device or Intuition, unit 0 can perform the same functions as unit 1.) See the " Input Device " chapter for more information on the input device. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
