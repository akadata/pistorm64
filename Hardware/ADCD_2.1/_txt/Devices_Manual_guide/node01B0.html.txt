TITLE: Standard Properties / CMAP

Standard Properties / CMAP ]" border=0> The optional (but encouraged) property "CMAP" stores color map data as triplets of red, green, and blue intensity values. The n color map entries ("color registers") are stored in the order 0 through n-1, totaling 3n bytes. Thus n is the ckSize/3. Normally, n would equal 2^(nPlanes). A CMAP chunk contains a ColorMap array as defined below. Note that these typedefs assume a C compiler that implements packed arrays of 3-byte elements. typedef struct { UBYTE red, green, blue; /* color intensities 0..255 */ } ColorRegister; /* size = 3 bytes */ typedef ColorRegister ColorMap[n]; /* size = 3n bytes */ The color components red, green, and blue represent fractional intensity values in the range 0 through 255 256ths. White is (255, 255, 255) and black is (0, 0, 0). If your machine has less color resolution, use the high order bits. Shift each field right on reading (or left on writing) and assign it to (from) a field in a local packed format like Color4, below. This achieves automatic conversion of images across environments with different color resolutions. On reading an ILBM, use defaults if the color map is absent or has fewer color registers than you need. Ignore any extra color registers. (See Appendix E for a better way to write colors) The example type Color4 represents the format of a color register in working memory of an Amiga computer, which has 4 bit video DACs. (The ":4" tells smarter C compilers to pack the field into 4 bits.) typedef struct { unsigned pad1 :4, red :4, green :4, blue :4; } Color4; /* Amiga RAM format. Not filed. */ Remember that every chunk must be padded to an even length, so a color map with an odd number of entries would be followed by a 0 byte, not included in the ckSize.
