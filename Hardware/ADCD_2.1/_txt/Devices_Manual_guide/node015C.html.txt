TITLE: Appendix C / MFM Track Encoding

Appendix C / MFM Track Encoding ]" border=0> When data is MFM encoded, the encoding is performed on the basis of a data block-size. In the sector encoding described above, there are bytes individually encoded; three segments of 4 bytes of data each, treated as longwords; one segment of 16 bytes treated as a block; two segments of longwords for the header and data checksums; and the data area of 512 bytes treated as a block. When the data is encoded, the odd bits are encoded first, then the even bits of the block. The procedure is: Make a block of bytes formed from all odd bits of the block, encode as MFM. Make a block of bytes formed from all even bits of the block, encode as MFM. Even bits are shifted left one bit position before being encoded. The raw MFM data that must be presented to the disk controller will be twice as large as the unencoded data. The relationship is: 1 -> 01 0 -> 10 ;if following a 0 0 -> 00 ;if following a 1 With clever manipulation, the blitter can be used to encode and decode the MFM. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
