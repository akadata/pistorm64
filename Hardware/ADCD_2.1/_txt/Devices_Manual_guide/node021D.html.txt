AIFF.doc / AIFF / Sample Points and Sample Frames ]" border=0> A large part of interpreting Audio IFF files revolves around the two concepts of sample points and sample frames. A sample point is a value representing a sample of a sound at a given point in time. Each sample point is stored as a linear, 2's-complement value which may be from 1 to 32 bits wide, as determined by sampleSize in the Common Chunk. Sample points are stored in an integral number of contiguous bytes. One- to eight-bit wide sample points are stored in one byte, 9- to 16-bit wide sample points are stored in two bytes, 17- to 24-bit wide sample points are stored in three bytes, and 25- to 32-bit wide sample points are stored in four bytes (most significant byte first). When the width of a sample point is not a multiple of eight bits, the sample point data is left justified, with the remaining bits zeroed. An example case is illustrated in Figure 4. A 12-bit sample point, binary 101000010111, is stored left justified in two bytes. The remaining bits are set to zero. ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 | 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 | |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___| 12 bit sample point is left justified rightmost 4 bits are zero padded Figure 4: 12-Bit Sample Point For multichannel sounds, single sample points from each channel are interleaved. A set of interleaved sample points is called a sample frame. Single sample points from each channel are interleaved such that each sample frame is a sample point from the same moment in time for each channel available. This is illustrated in Figure 5 for the stereo (two channel) case. sample sample sample frame 0 frame 1 frame N _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ | ch1 | ch2 | ch1 | ch2 | . . . | ch1 | ch2 | |_____|_____|_____|_____| |_____|_____| _____ | | = one sample point |_____| Figure 5: Sample Frames for Multichannel Sound For monophonic sound, a sample frame is a single sample point.

The sample points within a sample frame are packed together; there are no unused bytes between them. Likewise, the sample frames are packed together with no pad bytes.
