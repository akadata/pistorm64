RGBN-RGB8.doc / RGB8 Body Chunk ]" border=0> For each RGB value, a LONG-word (32 bits) is written: with the 24 RGB bits in the MSB positions; the "genlock" bit next, and then a 7 bit repeat count. In a previous version of this document, there appeared the following line: "If the repeat count is greater than 127, the same rules apply as in the RGBN BODY." But Impulse has never written more than a 7 bit repeat count, and when Imagine and Light24 were written, they didn't support reading anything but 7 bit counts. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
