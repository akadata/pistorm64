TITLE: 7 Keyboard Device / Amiga Reset Handling

7 Keyboard Device / Amiga Reset Handling ]" border=0> When a user presses the Ctrl key and both left- and right-Amiga keys simulataneously (the reset sequence), the keyboard device senses this and calls a prioritized chain of reset-handlers. These might be thought of as clean-up routines that "must" be performed before reset is allowed to occur. For example, if a disk write is in progress, the system should finish that before resetting the hardware so as not to corrupt the contents of the disk. It is important to note that not all Amigas handle reset processing in the same way. On the A500, the reset key sequence sends a hardware reset signal and never goes through the reset handlers. Also some of the early A2000s (i.e., German keyboards with the function keys the same size as the Esc key) do not handle the reset via the reset handlers. It is thus recommended that your application not rely on the reset handler abilities of the keyboard device.
