8 Narrator Device / Device Interface ]" border=0> The narrator device operates like all other Amiga devices. To use the narrator device, you must first open it. This initializes certain global areas, opens the audio device, allocates audio channels, and performs other housekeeping functions. Once open, the device is ready to receive I/O commands (most typically CMD_WRITE and CMD_READ ). Finally, when finished, the user should close the device. This will free some buffers and allow the entire device to be expunged should the system require memory. See the Introduction to Amiga System Devices chapter for general information on device usage. The narrator device uses two extended I/O request structures: narrator_rb for write commands (to produce speech output) and mouth_rb for read commands (to receive mouth shape changes and word/syllable synchronization events). Both I/O request structures have been expanded (in a backwards compatible fashion) for the V37 narrator device with several new fields defined. struct narrator_rb { struct IOStdReq message; /* Standard IORequest Block */ UWORD rate; /* Speaking rate (words/minute) */ UWORD pitch; /* Baseline pitch in Hertz */ UWORD mode; /* Pitch mode */ UWORD sex; /* Sex of voice */ UBYTE *ch_masks; /* Pointer to audio allocation maps */ UWORD nm_masks; /* Number of audio allocation maps */ UWORD volume; /* Volume. 0 (off) thru 64 */ UWORD sampfreq; /* Audio sampling frequency */ UBYTE mouths; /* If non-zero, generate mouths */ UBYTE chanmask; /* Which ch mask used (internal - do not modify)*/ UBYTE numchan; /* Num ch masks used (internal- do not modify) */ UBYTE flags; /* New feature flags */ UBYTE F0enthusiasm; /* F0 excursion factor */ UBYTE F0perturb; /* Amount of F0 perturbation */ BYTE F1adj; /* F1 adjustment in +- 5% steps */ BYTE F2adj; /* F2 adjustment in +- 5% steps */ BYTE F3adj; /* F3 adjustment in +- 5% steps */ BYTE A1adj; /* A1 adjustment in decibels */ BYTE A2adj; /* A2 adjustment in decibels */ BYTE A3adj; /* A3 adjustment in decibels */ UBYTE articulate; /* Transition time multiplier */ UBYTE centralize; /* Degree of vowel centralization */ char *centphon; /* Pointer to central ASCII phon */ BYTE AVbias; /* Amplitude of voicing bias */ BYTE AFbias; /* Amplitude of frication bias */ BYTE priority; /* Priority while speaking */ BYTE pad1; /* For alignment */ }; struct mouth_rb { struct narrator_rb voice;/* Speech IORequest Block */ UBYTE width; /* Mouth width (returned value) */ UBYTE height; /* Mouth height (returned value) */ UBYTE shape; /* Internal use, do not modify */ UBYTE sync; /* Returned sync events */ }; Details on the meaning of the various fields of the two I/O request blocks can be found in the Writing to the Narrator Device and Reading from the Narrator Device sections later in this chapter.
