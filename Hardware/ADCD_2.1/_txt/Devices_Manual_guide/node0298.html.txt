TITLE: SAMP.doc / Additional User Data Section

SAMP.doc / Additional User Data Section ]" border=0> There is a provision for storing user data for each wave. This is where an application can store Amiga hardware info, or other, application specific info. The waveHeader's USERtype tells what kind of data is stored. The current types are: #define SPECIFIC 0 #define VOLMOD 1 #define PERMOD 2 #define LOOPING 3 SPECIFIC (0) - application specific data. It should be stored in a format that some application can immediately recognize. (i.e. a "format within" the SAMP format) If the USERtype is SPECIFIC, and an application doesn't find some sort of header that it can re- cognize, it should conclude that this data was put there by "someone else", and ignore the data. VOLMOD (1) - This data is for volume modulation of an Amiga channel as described by the ADKCON register. This data will be sent to the modulator channel of the channel set to play the wave. PERMOD (2) - This data is for period modulation of an Amiga channel as described by the ADKCON register. This data will be sent to the modulator channel of the channel set to play the wave. LOOPING (3) - This contains more looping points for the sample. There are some samplers that allow more than just one loop (Casio products primarily). Additional looping info can be stored in this format: UWORD numOfLoops; /* number of loop points to follow */ ULONG StartLoop1, /* BYTE offset from the beginning of the sample to the start of loop1 */ EndLoop1, /* BYTE offset from the beginning of the sample to the end of loop1 */ StartLoop2, /* ...etc */ [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
