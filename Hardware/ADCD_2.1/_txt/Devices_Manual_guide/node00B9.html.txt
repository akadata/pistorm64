TITLE: 5 / Setting and Reading Controller Type / Determining The Controller Type

5 / Setting and Reading Controller Type / Determining The Controller Type ]" border=0> You determine the type of controller being used by passing an I/O request to the device with GPD_ASKCTYPE set in io_Command, 1 set in io_Length and the number of the unit set in io_Unit. The gameport device will respond with the type of controller being used. struct IOStdReq *GameIO; /* Must be initialized prior to using */ BYTE GetControllerType() { BYTE controller_type = 0; GameIO->io_Command = GPD_ASKCTYPE; /* get type of controller */ GameIO->io_Data = (APTR)&controller_type; /* place data here */ GameIO->io_Length = 1; DoIO(GameIO); return (controller_type); } The BYTE value returned corresponds to one of the five controller types noted above.
