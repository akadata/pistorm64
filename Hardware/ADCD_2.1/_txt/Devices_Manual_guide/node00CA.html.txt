TITLE: Amiga® RKM Devices: 6 Input Device

Amiga® RKM Devices: 6 Input Device ]" border=0> The input device is the central collection point for input events disseminated throughout the system. The best way to describe the input device is a manager of a stream with feeders. The input device itself and other modules such as the file system add events to the stream; so do input device "users" - programs or other devices that use parts of the stream or change it in some way. Feeders of the input device include the keyboard, timer and gameport devices. The keyboard, gameport, and timer devices are special cases in that the input device opens them and asks them for input. Users of the input device include Intuition and the console device.
