10 / Dumping Rastport to a Printer / Additional Notes on Graphic Dumps ]" border=0> 1. When dumping a 1 bitplane image select the black and white mode in Preferences. This is much faster than a grey-scale or color dump. 2. Horizontal dumps are much faster than vertical dumps. 3. Smoothing doubles the print time. Use it for final copy only. 4. F-S dithering doubles the print time. Ordered and half-tone dithering incur no extra overhead. 5. The lower the density, the faster the printout. 6. Friction-fed paper tends to be much more accurate than tractor-fed paper in terms of vertical dot placement (i.e., less horizontal strips or white lines). 7. Densities which use more than one pass tend to produce muddy grey-scale or color printouts. It is recommended not to choose these densities when doing a grey-scale or color dump. Keep This in Mind. ------------------ It is possible that the printer has been instructed to receive a certain amount of data and is still in an "expecting" state if an I/O request has been aborted by the user. This means the printer would try to finish the job with the data the next I/O request might send. Currently the best way to overcome this problem is for the printer to be reset.
