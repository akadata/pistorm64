10 / Creating a Printer Driver / Writing A Graphics Printer Driver ]" border=0> Designing the graphics portion of a custom printer driver consists of two steps: writing the printer-specific Render() , Transfer() and SetDensity() functions, and replacing the printer-specific values in printertag.asm. Render(), Transfer() and SetDensity() comprise render.c, transfer.c, and density.c modules, respectively. A printer that does not support graphics has a very simple form of Render(); it returns an error. Here is sample code for Render() for a non-graphics printer (such as an Alphacom or Diablo 630): #include "exec/types.h" #include "devices/printer.h" int Render() { return(PDERR_NOTGRAPHICS); } The following section describes the contents of a typical driver for a printer that does support graphics.
