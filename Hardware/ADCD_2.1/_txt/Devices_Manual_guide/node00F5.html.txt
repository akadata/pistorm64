TITLE: 14 / / Removing A Diskchange Software Interrupt Handler

14 / / Removing A Diskchange Software Interrupt Handler ]" border=0> You remove a software interrupt handler by passing an IOExtTD to the device with a pointer to an Interrupt structure set in io_Data, the length of the structure set in io_Length and TD_REMCHANGEINT set in io_Command. You must pass it the same Interrupt structure used to add the handler. DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Length = sizeof(struct Interrupt) DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Data = (APTR)Disk_Interrupt; DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Command = TD_REMCHANGEINT; DoIO((struct IORequest *)DiskIO); Don't use with pre-V36 and earlier versions. -------------------------------------------- Under pre-V36 and earlier versions of the Amiga system software, TD_REMCHANGEINT does not work and should not be used. Instead, use the workaround listed in the "trackdisk.doc" of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
