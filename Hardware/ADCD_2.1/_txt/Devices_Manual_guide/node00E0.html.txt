TITLE: 14 / Device Interface / Opening The Trackdisk Device

14 / Device Interface / Opening The Trackdisk Device ]" border=0> Three primary steps are required to open the trackdisk device: * Create a message port by calling CreatePort() . Reply messages from the device must be directed to a message port. * Create an extended I/O request structure of type IOExtTD . The IOExtTD structure is created by the CreateExtIO() function. * Open the trackdisk device. Call OpenDevice() , passing it the extended I/O request. For the trackdisk device, the flags parameter of the OpenDevice() function specifies whether you are opening a 3.5" drive (flags=0) or a 5.25" drive (flags=1). With flags set to 0 trackdisk will only open a 3.5" drive. To tell the device to open any drive it understands, set the flags parameter to TDF_ALLOW_NON_3_5. (See the include file devices/ trackdisk.h for more information.) #include struct MsgPort *TrackMP; /* Pointer for message port */ struct IOExtTD *TrackIO; /* Pointer for IORequest */ if (TrackMP=CreatePort(0,0) ) if (TrackIO=(struct IOExtTD *) CreateExtIO(TrackMP,sizeof(struct IOExtTD)) ) if (OpenDevice(TD_NAME,0L,(struct IORequest *)TrackIO,Flags) ) printf("%s did not open\n",TD_NAME); Disk Drive Unit Numbers. ------------------------ The unit number - second parameter of the OpenDevice() call - can be any value from 0 to 3. Unit 0 is the built-in 3.5" disk drive. Units 1 through 3 represent additional disk drives that may be connected to an Amiga system. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
