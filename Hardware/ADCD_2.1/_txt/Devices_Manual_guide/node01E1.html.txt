TITLE: Primitive Data Types / File References

Primitive Data Types / File References ]" border=0> Issue: We may need a standard form for references to other files. A "file ref" could name a directory and a file in the same type of operating system as the reference's originator. Following the reference would expect the file to be on some mounted volume, or perhaps the same directory as the file that made the reference. In a network environment, a file reference could name a server, too. Issue: How can we express operating-system independent file references? Issue: What about a means to reference a portion of another file? Would this be a "file ref" plus a reference to a "link" within the target file? [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
