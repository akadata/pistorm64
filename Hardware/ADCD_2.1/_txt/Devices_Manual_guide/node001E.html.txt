TITLE: 2 Audio Device / Device Interface

2 Audio Device / Device Interface ]" border=0> The audio device operates like the other Amiga I/O devices. To make sound, you first open the audio device, then send I/O requests to it, and then close it when finished. See " Introduction to Amiga System Devices " chapter for general information on device usage. Audio device commands use an extended I/O request block named IOAudio to send commands to the audio device. This is the standard IORequest block with some extra fields added at the end. struct IOAudio { struct IORequest ioa_Request;/* I/O request block. See exec/io.h. */ WORD ioa_AllocKey; /* Alloc. key filled in by audio device */ UBYTE *ioa_Data; /* Pointer to a sample or allocation mask */ ULONG ioa_Length; /* Length of sample or allocation mask. */ UWORD ioa_Period; /* Sample playback speed */ UWORD ioa_Volume; /* Volume of sound */ UWORD ioa_Cycles; /* # of times to play sample. 0=forever. */ struct Message ioa_WriteMsg;/* Filled in by device- usually not used */ }; See the include file devices/ audio.h for the complete structure definition.
