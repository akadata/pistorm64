TITLE: Standard Data and Property Chunks / Data Chunk BODY

Standard Data and Property Chunks / Data Chunk BODY ]" border=0> The BODY chunk contains the audio data samples. #define ID_BODY MakeID('B', 'O', 'D', 'Y') typedef character BYTE; /* 8 bit signed number, -128 through 127. */ /* BODY chunk contains a BYTE[], array of audio data samples. */ The BODY contains data samples grouped by octave. Within each octave are one-shot and repeat portions. Figure 2 depicts this arrangement of samples for an 8SVX where oneShotHiSamples = 24, repeatHiSamples = 16, samplesPerHiCycle = 8, and ctOctave = 3. The major divisions are octaves, the intermediate divisions separate the one-shot and repeat portions, and the minor divisions are cycles. +-+-+-+-+-+---+---+---+---+---+------+------+------+------+------+ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | O | R | One-shot | Repeat| One-shot | Repeat | | | | | | | | | |hi octave| middle octave | low octave | +---------+-------------------+----------------------------------+ Figure 2. BODY subdivisions. In general, the BODY has ctOctave octaves of data. The highest frequency octave comes first, comprising the fewest samples: oneShotHiSamples + repeatHiSamples. Each successive octave contains twice as many samples as the next higher octave but the same number of cycles. The lowest frequency octave comes last with the most samples: 2^(ctOctave-1) * (oneShotHiSamples + repeatHiSamples). The number of samples in the BODY chunk is ( 2^0 + ... + 2^(ctOctave-1) ) * (oneShotHiSamples + repeatHiSamples) Figure 3, below, looks closer at an example waveform within one octave of a different BODY chunk. In this example, oneShotHiSamples / samplesPerHiCycle = 2 cycles and repeatHiSamples / samplesPerHiCycle = 1 cycle. ^ (volume)| | /\ | /\ | | | | \ | | \ | | /\ | | \ | | \ | | / \ /\| / \| / \| +---/----\--/--+------/------+------/------+ |\ / \/ |\ | |\ | | | V | \ | | \ | | | | \ / | \ / | | | V | V | +--------------+-------------+-------------+----> (time) one-shot repeat repeat Figure 3. Example waveform. To avoid playback "clicks" the one-shot part should begin with a small sample value, and flow smoothly into the repeat part. The end of the repeat part should flow smoothly into the beginning of the next repeat part. If the VHDR field sCompression != sCmpNone, the BODY chunk is just an array of data bytes to feed through the specified decompresser function. All this stuff about sample sizes, octaves, and repeat parts applies to the decompressed data. Be sure to follow an odd-length BODY chunk with a 0 pad byte. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
