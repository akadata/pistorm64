TITLE: Standard Properties / SPRT

Standard Properties / SPRT ]" border=0> The presence of an "SPRT" chunk indicates that this image is intended as a sprite. It's up to the reader program to actually make it a sprite, if even possible, and to use or overrule the sprite precedence data inside the SPRT chunk: typedef UWORD SpritePrecedence;/* relative precedence,0 is the high */ Precedence 0 is the highest, denoting a sprite that is foremost. Creating a sprite may imply other setup. E.g., a 2 plane Amiga sprite would have transparentColor = 0. Color registers 1, 2, and 3 in the CMAP would be stored into the correct hardware color registers for the hardware sprite number used, while CMAP color register 0 would be ignored.
