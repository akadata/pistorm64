TITLE: Standard Data and Property Chunks / Dynamic Mark SEvent

Standard Data and Property Chunks / Dynamic Mark SEvent ]" border=0> An SEvent SID_Dynamic represents a dynamic mark like ppp and fff in Common Music Notation. Its data field is a MIDI key velocity number 0 through 127. This sets a "volume control" for following notes in the track. This "track volume control" is scaled by the overall score volume in the SHDR chunk. The default dynamic level is 127 (full volume). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
