11 / RigidDiskBlock - Fields and Implementation / Alien Filing Systems ]" border=0> When a filing system other than the ROM filing system is to be used, the following steps take place. 1. First, open filesystem.resource in preparation for finding the filesystem segment we want. If filesystem.resource doesn't exist then create it and add it via AddResource() . Under 2.0 the resource is created by the system early on in the initialization sequence. Under pre-V36 Kickstart, it is the responsibility of the first RDB driver to create it. 2. Scan filesystem.resource looking for a filesystem that matches the DosType and version that we want. If it exists go to step 4. 3. Since the driver couldn't find the filesystem it needed, it will have to load it from the RDB area. The list of FileSysHeaderBlocks (pointed to by the "RDSK" block) is scanned for a filesystem of the required DosType and version. If none is found then the driver will give up and abort the mounting of the partition. If the required filesystem is found, then it is LoadSeg() 'ed from the "LSEG" blocks and added as a new entry to the filesystem.resource. 4. The SegList pointer of the found or loaded filesystem is held in the FileSysEntry structure (which is basically an environment vector for this filing system). Using the patch flags, the driver now patches the newly created environment vector (pointed to by the new DosNode) using the values in the FileSysEntry being used. This ensures that the partition will have the correct filing system set up with the correct mount variables using a shared SegList. The eb_Mountlist will now be set up with prioritized bootnodes and maybe some non-bootable, but mounted partitions. The system bootstrap will now take over. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
