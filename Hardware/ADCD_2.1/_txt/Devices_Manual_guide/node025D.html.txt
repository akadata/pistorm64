The Object Chunks / STXT ]" border=0> STXT (0x53545854) /* Simple text */ The STXT chunk contains a text string along with some information on how and where to render the text. struct STXTstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; UBYTE Pad0; /* Always 0 (for future expansion) */ UBYTE WhichFont; /* Which font to use */ IEEE CharW, CharH, /* W/H of an individual char */ BaseX, BaseY, /* Start of baseline */ Rotation; /* Angle of text (in degrees) */ USHORT NumChars; char TextChars[NumChars]; }; The text string is in the character array, TextChars[]. The ID of the font used to render the text is WhichFont. The font's ID is set in a FONS chunk. The starting point of the baseline of the text is (BaseX, BaseY). This is the point around which the text is rotated. If the Rotation field is zero (degrees), the text's baseline will originate at (BaseX, BaseY) and move to the right. CharW and CharH are used to scale the text after rotation. CharW is the average character width and CharH is the average character height. The CharW/H fields are comparable to an X and Y font size.
