TITLE: 2 Audio Device / Double Buffered Sound Example

2 Audio Device / Double Buffered Sound Example ]" border=0> The program listed below demonstrates double buffering with the audio device. Run the program from the CLI. It takes one parameter - the name of an IFF 8SVX sample file to play on the Amiga's audio device. The maximum size for a sample on the Amiga is 128K. However, by using double-buffering and queueing up requests to the audio device, you can play longer samples smoothly and without breaks. Audio_8SVX.c [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
