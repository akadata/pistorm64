TITLE: A Quick Introduction to IFF / What does an IFF file look like?

A Quick Introduction to IFF / What does an IFF file look like? ]" border=0> IFF is based on data blocks called "chunk"s. Here's an example color map chunk: +------------------+ in an ILBM file, CMAP means char typeID[4] | "CMAP" | "color map" |------------------+ unsigned long dataSize | 48 | 48 data bytes |------------------+ char data[] | 0,0,0,255, | 16 3-byte color values: | 255,255,255... | black, white, .... +------------------+ +------------------+ in an ILBM file, CMAP means | "CMAP" | "color map" |------------------+ | 48 | 48 data bytes |------------------+ | 0,0,0,255, | 16 3-byte color values: | 255,255,255... | black, white, .... +------------------+ A chunk is made of a 4-character type identifier, a 32 bit data byte count, and the data bytes. It's like a Macintosh "resource" with a 32-bit size. Fine points: o Every 16- and 32-bit number is stored in 68000 byte order - highest byte first. An Intel CPU must reverse the 2- or 4-byte sequence of each number. This applies to chunk dataSize fields and to numbers inside chunk data. It does not affect character strings and byte data because you can't reverse a 1-byte sequence. But it does affect the 32-bit math used in IFF's MakeID macro. The standard does allow CPU specific byte ordering hidden within a chunk itself, but the practice is discouraged. o Every 16- and 32-bit number is stored on an even address. o Every odd-length chunk must be followed by a 0 pad byte. This pad byte is not counted in dataSize. o An ID is made of 4 ASCII characters in the range " " (space, hex 20) through "~" (tilde, hex 7E). Leading spaces are not permitted. o IDs are compared using a quick 32-bit equality test. Case matters. A chunk typically holds a C structure, Pascal record, or an array. For example, an ILBM picture has a BMHD bitmap header chunk (a structure) and a BODY raster body chunk (an array). To construct an IFF file, just put a file type ID (like ILBM ) into a wrapper chunk called a "FORM" (Think "FILE"). Inside that wrapper place chunks one after another (with pad bytes as needed). The chunk size always tells you how many more bytes you need to skip over to get to the next chunk. +------------------+ | | | "FORM" | FORM is a special chunk ID | | +------------------+ | 24070 | 24070 data bytes -- +------------------+ | | | | | "ILBM" | FORM type is ILBM | | | | | +--------------+ | | | | "BMHD" | | A BMHD bitmap header chunk | | |--------------| | (20 data bytes) | | | 20 | | | | |--------------| | | | | 320, 200, | | | | | 0 .... | | | | +--------------+ | | | | | | +--------------+ | | | | "CMAP" | | A CMAP color map chunk 24070 -- +------------------+ A FORM always contains one 4-character FORM type ID (a file type, in this case " ILBM ") followed by any number of data chunk. In this example, the FORM type is "ILBM", which stands for "InterLeaved BitMap". ( ILBM is an IFF standard for bitplane raster pictures.) This example has 3 chunks. Note the pad byte after the odd length chunk. Within FORMs ILBM , BMHD identifies a bitmap header chunk, CMAP a color map, and BODY a raster body. In general, the chunk IDs in a FORM are local to the FORM type ID. The exceptions are the 4 global chunk IDs "FORM", LIST , CAT , and PROP . (A FORM may contain other FORM chunks. E.g., an animation FORM might contain picture FORMs and sound FORMs.) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
