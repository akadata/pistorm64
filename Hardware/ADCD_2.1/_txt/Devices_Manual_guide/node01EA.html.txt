App.A EA IFF/ LISTs, CATs, and Shared Properties (Advanced topics) ]" border=0> Data often needs to be grouped together, for example, consider a list of icons. Sometimes a trick like arranging little images into a big raster works, but generally they'll need to be structured as a first class group. The objects " LIST " and " CAT " are IFF-universal mechanisms for this purpose. Note: LIST and CAT are advanced topics the first time reader will want to skip. Property settings sometimes need to be shared over a list of similar objects. E.g., a list of icons may share one color map. LIST provides a means called " PROP " to do this. One purpose of a LIST is to define the scope of a PROP. A " CAT ", on the other hand, is simply a concatenation of objects. Simpler programs may skip LIST s and PROP s altogether and just handle FORM s and CAT s. All "fully-conforming" IFF programs also know about "CAT ", "LIST", and "PROP". Any program that reads a FORM inside a LIST must process shared PROPs to correctly interpret that FORM. Group CAT Group LIST Group PROP Properties for LIST [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
