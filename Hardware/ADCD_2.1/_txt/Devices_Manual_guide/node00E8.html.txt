TITLE: 14 / Advanced Commands / Updating A Track Sector

14 / Advanced Commands / Updating A Track Sector ]" border=0> The Amiga trackdisk device does not write data sectors unless it is necessary (you request that a different track be used) or until the user requests that an update be performed. This improves system speed by caching disk operations. The update commands ensure that any buffered data is flushed out to the disk. If the track buffer has not been changed since the track was read in, the update commands do nothing. You update a data sector by passing an IOExtTD to the device with CMD_UPDATE or ETD_UPDATE set in io_Command. For ETD_UPDATE, you must also set iotd_Count to the current diskchange number. DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Command = TD_UPDATE; DoIO((struct IORequest *)DiskIO); [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
