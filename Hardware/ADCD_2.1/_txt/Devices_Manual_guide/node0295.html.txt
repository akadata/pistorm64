SAMP.doc / The Waveheader Explained ]" border=0> The WaveSize is, as stated, the number of BYTES in the wave's sample table. If your sample data consisted of the following 8 bit samples: BYTE 100,-90,80,-60,30,35,40,-30,-35,-40,00,12,12,10 then WaveSize = 14. (PAD THE DATA OUT TO AN EVEN NUMBER OF BYTES!) The MidiSampNum is ONLY used to hold the sample number received from a MIDI Sample Dump. It has no bearing on where the wave should be placed in a SAMP file. Also, the wave numbers in the PlayMap are between 1 to 255, with 1 being the number of the first wave in the file. Remember that a wave number of 0 is reserved to mean "no wave to play back". Likewise, the LoopType is only used to hold info from a MIDI sample dump. The InsType is explained at the end of this document. Often it will be set to 0. The RootNote is the Midi Note number that will play the wave back at it's original, recorded pitch. For example, consider the following excerpt of a PlayMap: PlayMap {2,0,0,4 /* Midi Note #0 channel assignment */ 4,100,1,0 /* Midi Note #1 " " */ 1,4,0,0 /* Midi Note #2 " " */ 60,2,1,1...} /* Midi Note #3 " " */ Notice that Midi Notes 0, 1, and 2 are all set to play wave number 4 (on Amiga channels 3, 0, and 1 respectively). If we set wave 4's RootNote = 1, then receiving Midi Note number 1 would play back wave 4 (on Amiga channel 0) at it's original pitch. If we receive a Midi Note number 0, then wave 4 would be played back on channel 3) a half step lower than it's original pitch. If we receive Midi Note number 2, then wave 4 would be played (on channel 1) a half step higher than it's original pitch. If we receive Midi Note number 3, then wave 4 would not be played at all because it isn't specified in the PlayMap bytes for Midi Note number 3. The Rate is the number of samples per second of the original pitch. For example, if Rate = 20000, then to play the wave at it's original pitch, the sampling period would be: (1/20000)/.279365 = .000178977 #define AUDIO_HARDWARE_FUDGE .279365 where .279365 is the Amiga Fudge Factor (a hardware limitation). Since the Amiga needs to see the period in terms of microseconds, move the decimal place to the right 6 places and our sampling period = 179 (rounded to an integer). In order to play the wave at higher or lower pitches, one would need to "transpose" this period value. By specifying a higher period value, the Amiga will play back the samples slower, and a lower pitch will be achieved. By specifying a lower period value, the amiga will play back the sample faster, and a higher pitch will be achieved. By specifying this exact period, the wave will be played back exactly "as it was recorded (sampled)". ("This period is JUST RIGHT!", exclaimed GoldiLocks.) Later, a method of transposing pitch will be shown using a "look up" table of periods. This should prove to be the fastest way to transpose pitch, though there is nothing in the SAMP format that compels you to do it this way. The LoopStart is a BYTE offset from the beginning of the wave to where the looping portion of the wave begins. For example, if SampleData points to the start of the wave, then SampleData + LoopStart is the start address of the looping portion. In 8SVX, the looping portion was referred to as repeatHiSamples. The data from the start of the wave up to the start of the looping portion is the oneShot portion of the wave. LoopEnd is a BYTE offset from the beginning of the wave to where the looping portion ends. This might be the very end of the wave in memory, or perhaps there might be still more data after this point. You can choose to ignore this "trailing" data and play back the two other portions of the wave just like an 8SVX file (except that there are no other interpolated octaves of this wave). VelTable contains 16 BYTE offsets from the beginning of the wave. Each successive value should be greater (or equal to) the preceding value. If VelStart = POSITIVE (64), then for each 8 increments in Midi Velocity above 0, you move UP in the table, add this offset to the wave's beginning address (start of oneShot), and start playback at that address. Here is a table relating received midi note-on velocity vs. start playback address for POSITIVE VelStart. SamplePtr points to the beginning of the sample. If midi velocity = 0, then don't play a sample, this is a note off If midi velocity = 1 to 7, then start play at SamplePtr + VelTable[0] If midi velocity = 8 to 15, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[1] If midi velocity = 16 to 23, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[2] If midi velocity = 24 to 31, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[3] If midi velocity = 32 to 39, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[4] If midi velocity = 40 to 47, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[5] If midi velocity = 48 to 55, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[6] If midi velocity = 56 to 63, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[7] If midi velocity = 64 to 71, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[8] If midi velocity = 72 to 79, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[9] If midi velocity = 80 to 87, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[10] If midi velocity = 88 to 95, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[11] If midi velocity = 96 to 103, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[12] If midi velocity = 104 to 111, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[13] If midi velocity = 112 to 119, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[14] If midi velocity = 120 to 127, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[15] We don't want to specify a scale factor and use integer division to find the sample start. This would not only be slow, but also, it could never be certain that the resulting sample would be a zero crossing if the start point is calcu- lated "on the fly". The reason for having a table is so that the offsets can be be initially set on zero crossings via an editor. This way, no audio "clicks" is guaranteed. This table should provide enough resolution. If VelStart = NEGATIVE (128), then for each 8 increments in midi velocity, you start from the END of VelTable, and work backwards. Here is a table for NEGATIVE velocity start. If midi velocity = 0, then don't play a sample, this is a note off If midi velocity = 1 to 7, then start play at SamplePtr + VelTable[15] If midi velocity = 8 to 15, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[14] If midi velocity = 16 to 23, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[13] If midi velocity = 24 to 31, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[12] If midi velocity = 32 to 39, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[11] If midi velocity = 40 to 47, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[10] If midi velocity = 48 to 55, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[9] If midi velocity = 56 to 63, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[8] If midi velocity = 64 to 71, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[7] If midi velocity = 72 to 81, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[6] If midi velocity = 80 to 87, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[5] If midi velocity = 88 to 95, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[4] If midi velocity = 96 to 103, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[3] If midi velocity = 104 to 111, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[2] If midi velocity = 112 to 119, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[1] If midi velocity = 120 to 127, then start at SamplePtr + VelTable[0] In essence, increasing midi velocity starts playback "farther into" the wave for POSITIVE VelStart. Increasing midi velocity "brings the start point back" toward the beginning of the wave for NEGATIVE VelStart. If VelStart is set to NONE (0), then the wave's playback start should not be affected by the table of offsets. What is the use of this feature? As an example, when a snare drum is hit with a soft volume, its initial attack is less pronounced than when it is struck hard. You might record a snare being hit hard. By setting VelStart to a NEGATIVE value and setting up the offsets in the Table, a lower midi velocity will "skip" the beginning samples and thereby tend to soften the initial attack. In this way, one wave yields a true representation of its instrument throughout its volume range. Furthermore, stringed and plucked instruments (violins, guitars, pianos, etc) exhibit different attacks at different volumes. VelStart makes these kinds of waves more realistic via a software implementation. Also, an application program can allow the user to enable/ disable this feature. See the section "Making the Velocity Table" for info on how to best choose the 16 table values. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
