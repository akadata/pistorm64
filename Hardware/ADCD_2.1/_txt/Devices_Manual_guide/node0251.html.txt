TITLE: The Global Drawing Attribute Chunks / DASH

The Global Drawing Attribute Chunks / DASH ]" border=0> DASH (0x44415348) /* Line dash pattern for edges */ This chunk describes the on-off dash pattern associated with a line. struct DASHstruct { ULONG ID; ULONG Size; USHORT DashID; /* ID of the dash pattern */ USHORT NumDashes; /* Should always be even */ IEEE Dashes[NumDashes]; /* On-off pattern */ }; DashID is the number assigned to this specific dash pattern. References to this dash pattern by other DR2D chunks are made using this number. The Dashes[] array contains the actual dash pattern. The first number in the array (element 0) is the length of the ``on'' portion of the pattern. The second number (element 1) specifies the ``off'' portion of the pattern. If there are more entries in the Dashes array, the pattern will continue. Even-index elements specify the length of an ``on'' span, while odd-index elements specify the length of an ``off'' span. There must be an even number of entries. These lengths are not in the same units as specified in the PPRF chunk, but are multiples of the line width, so a line of width 2.5 and a dash pattern of 1.0, 2.0 would have an ``on'' span of length 1.0 x 2.5 = 2.5 followed by an ``off'' span of length 2.0 x 2.5 = 5. The following figure shows several dash pattern examples. Notice that for lines longer than the dash pattern, the pattern repeats. Figure 1 - Dash Patterns By convention, DashID 0 is reserved to mean `No line pattern at all', i.e. the edges are invisible. This DASH pattern should not be defined by a DR2D DASH chunk. Again by convention, a NumDashes of 0 means that the line is solid. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
