TITLE: Additional Info / How Amiga HALFBRITE mode works

Additional Info / How Amiga HALFBRITE mode works ]" border=0> This one is simpler. In HALFBRITE mode, the Amiga interprets the bit in the last plane as HALFBRITE modification. The bits in the other planes are treated as normal color register numbers (RGB values for each color register is specified in the CMAP chunk). If the bit in the last plane is set (1), then that pixel is displayed at half brightness. This can provide up to 64 absolute colors. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
