TITLE: 6 Input Device / Writing Events to the Input Device Stream

6 Input Device / Writing Events to the Input Device Stream ]" border=0> Typically, input events are internally generated by the timer device, keyboard device, and input device. An application can also generate an input event by setting the appropriate fields for the event in an InputEvent structure and sending it to the input device. It will then be treated as any other event and passed through to the input handler chain. However, I/O requests for IND_WRITEEVENT cannot be made from interrupt code. You generate an input event by passing an IOStdReq to the device with IND_WRITEEVENT set in io_Command, a pointer to an InputEvent structure set in io_Data and the length of the structure set in io_Length. struct InputEvent *FakeEvent; struct IOStdReq *InputIO; InputIO->io_Data=(APTR)FakeEvent; InputIO->io_Length=sizeof(struct InputEvent); InputIO->io_Command=IND_WRITEEVENT; DoIO((struct IORequest *)InputIO); You Know What Happens When You Assume. -------------------------------------- This command propagates the input event through the handler chain. The handlers may link other events onto the end of this event or modify the contents of the data structure you constructed in any way they wish. Therefore, do not assume any of the data will be the same from event to event. Setting The Position Of The Mouse [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
