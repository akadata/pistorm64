11 SCSI Device / SCSI Device Commands and Functions ]" border=0> SCSI Device Command Operation ------------------- --------- HD_SCSICMD Issue a SCSI-direct command to a SCSI unit. Trackdisk Device Commands Supported by the SCSI Device ------------------------------------------------------ TD_CHANGESTATE Return the disk present/not-present status of a drive. TD_FORMAT Initialize one or more tracks with a data buffer. TD_PROTSTATUS Return the write-protect status of a disk. TD_SEEK Move the head to a specific track. Exec Commands Supported by SCSI Device -------------------------------------- CMD_READ Read one or more sectors from a disk. CMD_START Restart a SCSI unit that was previously stopped with CMD_STOP. CMD_STOP Stop a SCSI unit. CMD_WRITE Write one or more sectors to a disk. Exec Functions as Used in This Chapter -------------------------------------- AbortIO() Abort an I/O request to the SCSI device. AllocMem() Allocate a block of memory. AllocSignal() Allocate a signal bit. CheckIO() Return the status of an I/O request. CloseDevice() Relinquish use of the SCSI device. All requests must be complete before closing. DoIO() Initiate a command and wait for completion (synchronous request). FreeMem() Free a block of previously allocated memory. FreeSignal() Free a previously allocated signal. OpenDevice() Obtain use of the SCSI device. You specify the type of unit and its characteristics in the call to OpenDevice(). WaitIO() Wait for completion of an I/O request and remove it from the reply port. Exec Support Functions as Used in This Chapter ---------------------------------------------- CreateExtIO() Create an extended IORequest structure for use in communicating with the SCSI device. CreatePort() Create a message port for reply messages from the SCSI device. Exec will signal a task when a message arrives at the port. DeleteExtIO() Delete the extended IORequest structure created by CreateExtIO() . DeletePort() Delete the message port created by CreatePort() . [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
