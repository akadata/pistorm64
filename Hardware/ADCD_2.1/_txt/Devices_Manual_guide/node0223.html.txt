AIFF / The Instrument Chunk / Looping ]" border=0> Sound data can be looped, allowing a portion of the sound to be repeated in order to lengthen the sound. The structure below describes a loop. typedef struct { short PlayMode; MarkerId beginLoop; MarkerId endLoop; } Loop; A loop is marked with two points, a begin position and an end position. There are two ways to play a loop, forward looping and forward/backward looping. In the case of forward looping, playback begins at the beginning of the sound, continues past the begin position and continues to the end position, at which point playback starts again at the begin position. The segment between the begin and end positions, called the loop segment, is played repeatedly until interrupted by a user action, such as the release of a key on a sampling instrument. ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ sample frames | | | | | | | | |___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___| ^ ^ begin position end position Figure 9: Sample Frame Looping With forward/backward looping, the loop segment is first played from the begin position to the end position, and then played backwards from the end position to the begin position. This flip-flop pattern is repeated over and over again until interrupted. The playMode specifies which type of looping is to be performed: #define NoLooping 0 #define ForwardLooping 1 #define ForwardBackwardLooping 2 If NoLooping is specified, then the loop points are ignored during playback. The beginLoop is a marker id that marks the begin position of the loop segment. The endLoop marks the end position of a loop. The begin position must be less than the end position. If this is not the case, then the loop segment has zero or negative length and no looping takes place. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
