SAMP.doc / Converting Midi Sample Dump to SAMP ]" border=0> SEMANTICS: When MIDI literature talks about a sample, usually it means a collection of many sample points that make up what we call "a wave". Therefore, a Midi Sample Dump sends all the sample data that makes up ONE wave. A SAMP file is designed to hold up to 255 of these waves (midi dumps). The Midi Sample Dump specifies playback rate only in terms of a sample PERIOD in nanoseconds. SAMP also expresses playback in terms of samples per second (frequency). The Amiga needs to see its period rounded to the nearest microsecond. If you take the sample period field of a Midi sample Dump (the 8th, 9th, and 10th bytes of the Dump Header LSB first) which we will call MidiSamplePer, and the Rate of a SAMP file, here is the relationship: Rate = (1/MidiSamplePer) x 10E9 Also the number of samples (wave's length) in a Midi Sample Dump (the 11th, 12th, and 13th bytes of the Dump header) is expressed in WORDS. SAMP's WaveSize is expressed in the number of BYTES. (For the incredibly stupid), the relationship is: WaveSize = MidiSampleLength x 2 A Midi sample dump's LoopStart point and LoopEnd point are also in WORDS as versus the SAMP equivalents expressed in BYTES. A Midi sample dump's sample number can be 0 to 65535. A SAMP file can hold up to 255 waves, and their numbers in the playmap must be 1 to 255. (A single, Midi Sample Dump only sends info on one wave.) When recieving a Midi Sample Dump, just store the sample number (5th and 6th bytes of the Dump Header LSB first) in SAMP's MidiSampNum field. Then forget about this number until you need to send the wave back to the Midi instrument from whence it came. A Midi Dump's loop type can be forward, or forward/backward. Amiga hardware supports forward only. You should store the Midi Dump's LoopType byte here, but ignore it otherwise until/unless Amiga hardware supports "reading audio data" in various ways. If so, then the looptype is as follows: forward = 0, backward/forward = 1 A Midi Dump's sample format byte is the same as SAMP's. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
