5 / Gameport Events / Reading Gameport Events ]" border=0> You read gameport events by passing an I/O request to the device with GPD_READEVENT set in io_Command, the address of the InputEvent structure to store events set in io_Data and the size of the structure set in io_Length. struct InputEvent GameEV; struct IOStdRequest *GameIO; /* Must be initialized prior to using */ void send_read_request() { GameIO->io_Command = GPD_READEVENT; /* Read events */ GameIO->io_Length = sizeof (struct InputEvent); GameIO->io_Data = (APTR)&GameEV; /* put events in GameEV*/ SendIO(GameIO); /* Asynchronous */ } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
