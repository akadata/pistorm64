Additional Info / Other Notes ]" border=0> Amiga ILBMs images must be a even number of bytes wide. Smaller images (such as brushes) are padded to an even byte width. ILBMs created with Electronic Arts IBM and Amiga "DPaintII" packages are compatible (though you may have to use a '.lbm' filename extension on an IBM). The ILBM graphic files may be transferred between the machines (or between the Amiga and IBM sides your Amiga if you have a CBM Bridgeboard card installed) and loaded into either package.
