TITLE: 12 / Alternative Modes for Serial Input or Output / High Speed Operation

12 / Alternative Modes for Serial Input or Output / High Speed Operation ]" border=0> The more characters that are processed in each I/O request, the higher the total throughput of the device. The following technique will minimize device overhead for reads: * Use the SDCMD_QUERY command to get the number of characters currently in the buffer (see the devices/ serial.h Autodocs for information on SDCMD_QUERY). * Use DoIO() to read all available characters (or the maximum size of your buffer). In this case, DoIO() is guaranteed to return without waiting. * If zero characters are in the buffer, post an asynchronous request ( SendIO() ) for 1 character. When at least one is ready, the device will return it. Now go back to the first step. * If the user decides to quit the program, AbortIO() any pending requests. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
