DR2D.doc / CHDF ]" border=0> CHDF (0x43484446) /* Character definition */ This chunk defines the shape of ProVector's outline fonts. struct CHDFstruct { short Ch; /* The character we're defining (ASCII) */ short NumPoints; /* The number of points in the definition */ IEEE XWidth, /* Position for next char on baseline - X */ YWidth; /* Position for next char on baseline - Y */ /* IEEE Points[2*NumPoints]*/ /* The actual points */ }; #define INDICATOR 0xFFFFFFFF /* If X == INDICATOR, Y is an action */ #define IND_SPLINE 0x00000001 /* Next 4 pts are spline control pts */ #define IND_MOVETO 0x00000002 /* Start new subpoly */ #define IND_STROKE 0x00000004 /* Stroke previous path */ #define IND_FILL 0x00000008 /* Fill previous path */ Ch is the value (normally ASCII) of the character outline this chunk defines. Like Ch1 and Ch2 in the KERN chunk, Ch is stored as a 16-bit value. (XWidth,YWidth) is the offset to the baseline for the following character. OFNT outlines are defined using the same method used to define DR2D's polygons (see the description of OPLY/CPLY for details). Because the OFNT FORM does not have an ATTR chunk, it needed an alternative to make fills and strokes possible. There are two extra bits used in font indicator points not found in polygon indicator points, the IND_STROKE and IND_FILL bits (see defines above). These two defines describe how to render the current path when rendering fonts. The current path remains invisible until the path is either filled and/or stroked. When the IND_FILL bit is set, the currently defined path is filled in with the current fill pattern (as specified in the current ATTR chunk). A set IND_STROKE bit indicates that the currently defined path itself should be rendered. The current ATTR's chunk dictates the width of the line, as well as several other attributes of the line. These two bits apply only to the OFNT FORM and should not be used in describing DR2D polygons. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
