TITLE: SMUS IFF Simple Musical Score / Private Chunks

SMUS IFF Simple Musical Score / Private Chunks ]" border=0> As in any IFF FORM , there can be private chunks in a FORM SMUS that are designed for one particular program to store its private information. All IFF reader programs skip over unrecognized chunks, so the presense of private chunks can't hurt. Instant Music stores some global score information in a chunk of ID "IRev" and some other information in a chunk of ID "BIAS". [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
