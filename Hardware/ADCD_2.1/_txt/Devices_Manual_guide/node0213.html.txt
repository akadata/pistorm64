A / IFF Third Party Public Form and Chunk Specification / AIFF.doc ]" border=0> Audio 1-32 bit samples (Mac,AppleII,Synthia Pro) provided by Steve Milne and Matt Deatherage, Apple Computer, Inc. AIFF: Audio Interchange File Format File The Audio Interchange File Format (Audio IFF) provides a standard for storing sampled sounds. The format is quite flexible, allowing the storage of monaural or multichannel sampled sounds at a variety of sample rates and sample widths. Audio IFF conforms to the "EA IFF 85: Standard for Interchange Format Files" developed by Electronic Arts. Audio IFF is primarily an interchange format, although application designers should find it flexible enough to use as a data storage format as well. If an application does choose to use a different storage format, it should be able to convert to and from the format defined in this document. This ability to convert will facilitate the sharing of sound data between applications. Audio IFF is the result of several meetings held with music developers over a period of ten months during 1987 and 1988. Apple Computer greatly appreciates the comments and cooperation provided by all developers who helped define this standard. Another "EA IFF 85" sound storage format is "8SVX IFF 8-bit Sampled Voice", by Electronic Arts. '8SVX', which handles eight-bit monaural samples, is intended mainly for storing sound for playback on personal computers. Audio IFF is intended for use with a larger variety of computers, sampled sound instruments, sound software applications, and high fidelity recording devices.
