TITLE: 12 / Device Interface / Writing To The Serial Device

12 / Device Interface / Writing To The Serial Device ]" border=0> You write to the serial device by passing an IOExtSer to the device with CMD_WRITE set in io_Command, the number of bytes to be written set in io_Length and the address of the write buffer set in io_Data. To write a NULL-terminated string, set the length to -1; the device will output from your buffer until it encounters and transmits a value of zero (0x00). SerialIO->IOSer.io_Length = -1; SerialIO->IOSer.io_Data = (APTR)"Life is but a dream. "; SerialIO->IOSer.io_Command = CMD_WRITE; DoIO((struct IORequest *)SerialIO); /* execute write */ The length of the request is -1, meaning we are writing a NULL-terminated string. The number of characters sent can be found in io_Actual. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
