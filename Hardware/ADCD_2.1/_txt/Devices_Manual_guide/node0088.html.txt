4 / About Console I/O / General Console Screen Output ]" border=0> Console character screen output (as compared to console command sequence transmission) outputs all standard printable characters (character values hex 20 through 7E and A0 through FF) normally. Many control characters such as BACKSPACE (0x8) and RETURN (0x13) are translated into their exact ANSI equivalent actions. The LINEFEED character (0xA) is a bit different in that it can be translated into a RETURN/LINEFEED action. The net effect is that the cursor moves to the first column of the next line whenever an is displayed. This option is set via the mode control sequences discussed under Control Sequences for Window Output. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
