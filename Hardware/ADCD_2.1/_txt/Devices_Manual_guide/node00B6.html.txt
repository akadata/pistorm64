5 / Gameport Events / Setting Gameport Event Trigger Conditions ]" border=0> You set the conditions that can trigger a gameport event by passing an I/O request to the device with GPD_SETTRIGGER set in io_Command and the address of a GamePortTrigger structure set in io_Data. The information needed for gameport trigger setting is placed into a GamePortTrigger data structure which is defined in the include file devices/ gameport.h . struct GamePortTrigger { UWORD gpt_Keys; /* key transition triggers */ UWORD gpt_Timeout; /* time trigger (vertical blank units) */ UWORD gpt_XDelta; /* X distance trigger */ UWORD gpt_YDelta; /* Y distance trigger */ } A few points to keep in mind with the GPD_SETTRIGGER command are: * Setting GPTF_UPKEYS enables the reporting of upward transitions. Setting GPTF_DOWNKEYS enables the reporting of downward transitions. These flags may both be specified. * The field gpt_Timeout specifies the time interval (in vertical blank units) between reports in the absence of another trigger condition. In other words, an event is generated every gpt_Timeout ticks. Vertical blank units may differ from country to country (e.g 60 Hz NTSC, 50 Hz PAL.) To find out the exact frequency use this code fragment: #include extern struct ExecBase *SysBase; UBYTE get_frequency(void) { return((UBYTE)SysBase->VBlankFrequency); } * The gpt_XDelta and gpt_YDelta fields specify the x and y distances which, if exceeded, trigger a report. For a mouse controller, you can trigger on a certain minimum-sized move in either the x or y direction, on up or down transitions of the mouse buttons, on a timed basis, or any combination of these conditions. For example, suppose you normally signal mouse events if the mouse moves at least 10 counts in either the x or y directions. If you are moving the cursor to keep up with mouse movements and the user moves the mouse less than 10 counts, after a period of time you will want to update the position of the cursor to exactly match the mouse position. Thus the timed report of current mouse counts would be preferred. The following structure would be used: #define XMOVE 10 #define YMOVE 10 struct GamePortTrigger GameTR = { GPTF_UPKEYS | GPTF_DOWNKEYS, /* trigger on all key transitions */ 1800, /* and every 36(PAL) or 30(NTSC) seconds */ XMOVE, /* for any 10 in an x or y direction */ YMOVE }; For a joystick controller, you can select timed reports as well as button-up and button-down report trigger conditions. For an absolute joystick specify a value of one (1) for the GameTR_XDelta and GameTR_YDelta fields or you will not get any direction events. You set the trigger conditions by using the following code or its equivalent: struct IOStdReq *GameIO; void set_trigger_conditions(struct GamePortTrigger *GameTR) { GameIO->io_Command = GPD_SETTRIGGER; /* set trigger conditions */ GameIO->io_Data = (APTR)GameTR; /* from GameTR */ GameIO->io_Length = sizeof(struct GamePortTrigger); DoIO(GameIO); } Triggers and Reads. ------------------- If a task sets trigger conditions and does not ask for the position reports the gameport device will queue them up anyway. If the trigger conditions occur again and the gameport device buffer is filled, the additional triggers will be ignored until the buffer is read by a device read request ( GPD_READEVENT ) or a system CMD_CLEAR command flushes the buffer.
