The global drawing attribute chunks describe elements of a 2D drawing that are common to many objects in the drawing. Document preferences, palette information, and custom fill patterns are typical document-wide settings defined in global drawing attribute chunks. The object attribute chunks are used to set certain properties of the object chunk(s) that follows the object attribute chunk. The current fill pattern, dash pattern, and line color are all set using an object attribute chunk. Object chunks describe the actual DR2D drawing. Polygons, text, and bitmaps are found in these chunks. Global Drawing Attribute Chunk Object Attribute Chunks The Object Chunks [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
