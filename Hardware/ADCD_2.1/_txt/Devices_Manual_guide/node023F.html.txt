TITLE: Introduction / Recording ANIMs / Long Delta mode

Introduction / Recording ANIMs / Long Delta mode ]" border=0> This mode stores the actual new frame long-words which are different, along with the offset in the bitmap. The exact format is shown and discussed in section 2 below. Each plane is handled separately, with no data being saved if no changes take place in a given plane. Strings of 2 or more long-words in a row which change can be run together so offsets do not have to be saved for each one. Constructing this data chunk usually consists of having a buffer to hold the data, and calculating the data as one compares the new frame, long-word by long-word, with two frames back.
