TITLE: 15 Resources / BattClock Resource

15 Resources / BattClock Resource ]" border=0> The battery-backed clock (BattClock) keeps Amiga time while the system is powered off. The time from the BattClock is loaded into the Amiga system clock as part of the boot sequence. The battclock resource provides access to the BattClock. Three functions allow you to read the BattClock value, reset it and set it to a value you desire. BattClock Resource Functions ---------------------------- ReadBattClock() Read the time from the BattClock and returns it as the number of seconds since 12:00 AM, January 1, 1978. ResetBattClock() Reset the BattClock to 12:00 AM, January 1, 1978. WriteBattClock() Set the BattClock to the number of seconds you pass it relative to 12:00 AM, January 1, 1978. The utility.library contains time functions which convert the number of seconds since 12:00 AM, January 1, 1978 to a date and time we can understand, and vice versa. You will find these functions useful when dealing with the BattClock. The example program below uses the Amiga2Date() utility function to convert the value returned by ReadBattClock() . See the " Utility Library " chapter of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries for a discussion of the utility.library and the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs for a listing of its functions. So, You Want to Be A Time Lord? ------------------------------- This resource will allow you to set the BattClock to any value you desire. Keep in mind that this time will endure a reboot and could adversely affect your system.
