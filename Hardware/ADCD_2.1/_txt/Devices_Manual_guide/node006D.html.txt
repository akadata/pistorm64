3 / Device Interface / Clipboard Messages ]" border=0> When an application performs a post, it must specify a message port for the clipboard to send a message to if it needs the application to satisfy the post with a write called the SatisfyMsg. struct SatisfyMsg { struct Message sm_Message; /* the length will be 6 */ UWORD sm_Unit; /* 0 for the primary clip unit */ LONG sm_ClipID; /* the clip identifier of the post */ } This structure is defined in the include file devices/ clipboard.h . If the application wishes to determine if a post it has recently performed is still the current clip, it should compare the io_ClipID found in the post request upon return with that returned by the CBD_CURRENTREADID command. If an application has a pending post and wishes to determine if it should satisfy it (for example, before it exits), it should compare the io_ClipID of the post I/O request with that of the CBD_CURRENTWRITEID command. If the application receives a satisfy message from the clipboard device (format described below), it must immediately perform the write with the io_ClipID of the post. The satisfy message from the clipboard may be removed from the application message port by the clipboard device at any time (because it is re-used by the clipboard device). It is not dangerous to spuriously satisfy a post, however, because it is identified by the io_ClipID. The cut data is provided to the clipboard device via either a write or a post of the cut data. The write command accepts the data immediately and copies it onto the clipboard. The post command allows an application to inform the clipboard of a cut, but defers the write until the data is actually required for a paste. In the preceding discussion, references to the read and write commands of the clipboard device actually refer to a sequence of read or write commands, where the clip data is acquired and provided in pieces instead of all at once. The clipboard has an end-of-clip concept that is analogous to end-of-file for both read and write. The read end-of-file must be triggered by the user of the clipboard in order for the clipboard to move on to service another application's requests, and consists of reading data past the end of file. The write end-of-file is indicated by use of the update command, which indicates to the clipboard that the previous write commands are completed. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
