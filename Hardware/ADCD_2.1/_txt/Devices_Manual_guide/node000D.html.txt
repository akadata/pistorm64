1 Introduction to Amiga System Devices / Example Device Programs ]" border=0> The following short programs are examples of how to use a device. Both send the serial device command SDCMD_QUERY to the serial device to determine the status of the serial device lines and registers. The first program is for pre-V36 versions of the operating system (before Release 2) and the second is for V36 and higher. You may use the pre-V36 version with V36 and higher, but you may not use the V36 version with older systems. The programs differ in the way they create the message port and I/O request. The pre-V36 version uses the amiga.lib functions CreatePort() to create the message port and CreateExtIO() to create the I/O request; the V36 version uses the Exec functions CreateMsgPort() to create the message port and CreateIORequest() to create the I/O request. Those are the only differences. Device Usage Example (Pre-V36) Device Usage Example (Kickstart V36 And Up) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
