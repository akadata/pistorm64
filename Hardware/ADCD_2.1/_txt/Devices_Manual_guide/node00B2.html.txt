TITLE: 5 / Device Interface / Gameport Device Controllers

5 / Device Interface / Gameport Device Controllers ]" border=0> The Amiga has five gameport device controller types. GAMEPORT DEVICE CONTROLLERS Controller Type Description --------------- ----------- GPCT_MOUSE Mouse controller GPCT_ABSJOYSTICK Absolute (digital) joystick GPCT_RELJOYSTICK Relative (digital) joystick GPCT_ALLOCATED Custom controller GPCT_NOCONTROLLER No controller To use the gameport device, you must define the type of device connected to the gameport and define how the device is to respond. The gameport device can be set up to return the controller status immediately or only when certain conditions have been met. When a gameport device unit reponds to a request for input, it creates an input event. The contents of the input event will vary based on the type of device and the trigger conditions you have declared. * A mouse controller can report input events for one, two, or three buttons and for positive or negative (x,y) movements. A trackball controller or car-driving controller is generally of the same type and can be declared as a mouse controller. * An absolute joystick reports one single event for each change of its current location. If, for example, the joystick is centered and the user pushes the stick forward and holds it in that position, only one single forward-switch event will be generated. * A relative joystick, on the other hand, is comparable to an absolute joystick with "autorepeat" installed. As long as the user holds the stick in a position other than centered, the gameport device continues to generate position reports. * There is currently no system software support for proportional joysticks or proportional controllers (e.g., paddles). If you write custom code to read proportional controllers or other controllers (e.g., light pen) make certain that you issue GPD_SETCTYPE (explained below) with controller type GPCT_ALLOCATED to insure that other applications know the connector is being used. GPCT_NOCONTROLLER. ------------------ The controller type GPCT_NOCONTROLLER is not a controller at all, but a flag to indicate that the unit is not being used at the present time.
