TITLE: 14 / Commands for Low-Level Access / Writing Raw Data To A Disk

14 / Commands for Low-Level Access / Writing Raw Data To A Disk ]" border=0> ETD_RAWWRITE and TD_RAWWRITE perform a raw write to a track on the disk. They seek to the specified track and write it from the user's buffer. No processing of the track is done. It will be written exactly as the bits come out of the buffer - typically in some legal flux format (such as MFM, FM, GCR; if you don't know what these are, you shouldn't be using this call). Caveat Programmer. This interface is intended for sophisticated programming only. You must fully understand digital magnetic recording to be able to utilize this call. It is also important that you understand that the MFM encoding scheme used by the higher level trackdisk routines may change without notice. Thus, this routine is only really useful for encoding and writing other disk formats such as MS-DOS disks. You write raw data to a disk by passing an IOExtTD to the device with TD_RAWWRITE or ETD_RAWWRITE set in io_Command, the number of bytes to be written set in io_Length (maximum 32K), a pointer to the write buffer set in io_Data, and io_Offset set to the byte offset of the track where you want to the write to begin. For ETD_RAWWRITE, you must also set iotd_Count to the current diskchange number. DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Length = 1024; /* number of bytes to write */ DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Data = (APTR)Writebuffer; /* pointer to buffer */ DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Offset = (ULONG)(TRACK_SIZE * track); /* track no. */ DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Flags = IOTDF_INDEX /* Set for index sync */ DiskIO->iotd_Count = change_count; /* diskchange number */ DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Command = ETD_RAWWRITE; DoIO((struct IORequest *)DiskIO); A raw read may be synched with the index pulse by setting the IOTDF_INDEXSYNC flag or synched with a $4489 sync pattern by setting the IOTDF_WORDSYNC flag. See the " trackdisk.doc " of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes and Autodocs for more information about these flags. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
