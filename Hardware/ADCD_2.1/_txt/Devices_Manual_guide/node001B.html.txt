TITLE: 2 Audio Device / About Amiga Audio

2 Audio Device / About Amiga Audio ]" border=0> Most personal computers that produce sound have hardware designed for one specific synthesis technique. The Amiga computer uses a very general method of digital sound synthesis that is quite similar to the method used in digital hi-fi components and state-of-the-art keyboard and drum synthesizers. For programs that can afford the memory, playing sampled sounds gives you a simple and very CPU-efficient method of sound synthesis. A sampled sound is a table of numbers which represents a sound digitally. When the sound is played back by the Amiga, the table is fed by a DMA channel into one of the four digital-to-analog converters in the custom chips. The digital-to-analog converter converts the samples into voltages that can be played through amplifiers and loudspeakers, reproducing the sound. On the Amiga you can create sound data in many other ways. For instance, you can use trigonometric functions in your programs to create the more traditional sounds - sine waves, square waves, or triangle waves - by using tables that describe their shapes. Then you can combine these waves for richer sound effects by adding the tables together. Once the data are entered, you can modify them with techniques described below. For information about the limitations of the audio hardware and suggestions for improving system efficiency and sound quality, refer to the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual . Some commands enable your program to co-reside with other programs using the audio device at the same time. Programs can co-reside because the audio device handles allocation of audio channels and arbitrates among programs competing for the same resources. When properly used, this allows many programs to use the audio device simultaneously. The audio device commands help isolate the programmer from the idiosyncrasies of the custom chip hardware and make it easier to use. But you can also produce sound on the Amiga by directly accessing the hardware registers if you temporarily lock out other users first. For certain types of sound synthesis, this is more CPU-efficient. Definitions [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
