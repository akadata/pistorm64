NOTE: the "bits" field was actually intended ( by the original creator of the ANIM format, Gary Bonham of SPARTA, Inc.) for use with only with compression method 4. I am using bit 2 of the bits field to indicate the Exclusive OR operation in the context of method 5, which seems like a reasonable generalization. For an Anim Brush with 10 frames, there will be an initial frame followed by 10 Delta's (i.e ILBMS containing ANHD and DLTA chunks). Applying the first Delta to the initial frame generates the second frame, applying the second Delta to the second frame generates the third frame, etc. Applying the last Delta thus brings back the first frame. The DLTA chunk begins with 16 LONG plane offets, of which DPaint only uses the first 6 (at most). These plane offsets are either the offset (in bytes) from the beginning of the DLTA chunk to the data for the corresponding plane, or Zero, if there was no change in that plane. Thus the first plane offset is either 0 or 64. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
