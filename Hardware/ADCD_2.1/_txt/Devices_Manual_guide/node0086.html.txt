TITLE: 4 Console Device / About Console I/O

4 Console Device / About Console I/O ]" border=0> The console device may be thought of as a kind of terminal. You send character streams to the console device; you also receive them from the console device. These streams may be characters, control sequences or a combination of the two. Console I/O is closely associated with the Amiga Intuition interface; a console must be tied to a window that is already opened. From the Window data structure, the console device determines how many characters it can display on a line and how many lines of text it can display in a window without clipping at any edge. You can open the console device many times, if you wish. The result of each open call is a new console unit. AmigaDOS and Intuition see to it that only one window is currently active and its console, if any, is the only one (with a few exceptions) that receives notification of input events, such as keystrokes. Later in this chapter you will see that other Intuition events can be sensed by the console device as well. Introducing... -------------- For this entire chapter the characters " " represent the control sequence introducer. For output you may use either the two-character sequence [ (0x1B 0x5B) or the one-byte value 0x9B. For input you will receive 0x9B unless the sequence has been typed by the user.
