TITLE: Standard Data and Property Chunks / Required Property SHDR

Standard Data and Property Chunks / Required Property SHDR ]" border=0> The required property "SHDR" holds an SScoreHeader as defined in these C declarations and following documentation. An SHDR specifies global information for the score. It must appear before the TRAK s in a FORM SMUS . #define ID_SMUS MakeID('S', 'M', 'U', 'S') #define ID_SHDR MakeID('S', 'H', 'D', 'R') typedef struct { UWORD tempo; /* tempo, 128ths quarter note/minute */ UBYTE volume; /* overall playback volume 0 through 127 */ UBYTE ctTrack; /* count of tracks in the score */ } SScoreHeader; [Implementation details. In the C struct definitions in this memo, fields are filed in the order shown. A UBYTE field is packed into an 8-bit byte. Programs should set all "pad" fields to 0. MakeID is a C macro defined in the main IFF document and in the source file IFF.h .] The field tempo gives the nominal tempo for all tracks in the score. It is expressed in 128ths of a quarter note per minute, i.e., 1 represents 1 quarter note per 128 minutes while 12800 represents 100 quarter notes per minute. You may think of this as a fixed point fraction with a 9-bit integer part and a 7-bit fractional part (to the right of the point). A coarse-tempoed program may simply shift tempo right by 7 bits to get a whole number of quarter notes per minute. The tempo field can store tempi in the range 0 up to 512. The playback program may adjust this tempo, perhaps under user control. Actually, this global tempo could actually be just an initial tempo if there are any "set tempo" SEvent s inside the score (see TRAK , below). Or the global tempo could be scaled by "scale tempo" SEvents inside the score. These are potential extensions that can safely be ignored by current programs. [See More SEvents To Be Defined , below.] The field volume gives an overall nominal playback volume for all tracks in the score. The range of volume values 0 through 127 is like a MIDI key velocity value. The playback program may adjust this volume, perhaps under direction of a user "volume control". Actually, this global volume level could be scaled by dynamic-mark SEvent s inside the score (see TRAK , below). The field ctTrack holds the count of tracks, i.e., the number of TRAK chunks in the FORM SMUS (see below). This information helps the reader prepare for the following data. A playback program will typically load the score and call a driver routine PlayScore(tracks, tempo, volume), supplying the tempo and volume from the SHDR chunk. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
