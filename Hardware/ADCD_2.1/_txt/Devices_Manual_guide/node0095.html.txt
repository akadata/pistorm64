4 Console Device / Input Event Reports ]" border=0> If you select any of these events you will start to get information about the events in the following form: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; | is a one-byte field. It is the "control sequence introducer," 0x9B in hex. is the RAW input event type, from the above table. is usually 0. If the mouse is moved to the right controller, this would be 1. indicates which raw key number was pressed. This field can also be used for mouse information. The Raw Key Might Be The Wrong Key. ----------------------------------- National keyboards often have different keyboard arrangements. This means that a particular raw key number may represent different characters on different national keyboards. The normal console read stream (as opposed to raw events) will contain the proper ASCII character for the keypress as translated according to the user's keymap. indicates the state of the keyboard and system. The qualifiers are defined as follows: INPUT EVENT QUALIFIERS Bit Mask Key --- ---- --- 0 0001 Left shift 1 0002 Right shift 2 0004 Caps Lock Associated keycode is special; see below. 3 0008 Ctrl 4 0010 Left Alt 5 0020 Right Alt 6 0040 Left Amiga key pressed 7 0080 Right Amiga key pressed 8 0100 Numeric pad 9 0200 Repeat 10 0400 Interrupt Not currently used. 11 0800 Multibroadcast This window (active one) or all windows. 12 1000 Middle mouse button (Not available on standard mouse) 13 2000 Right mouse button 14 4000 Left mouse button 15 8000 Relative mouse Mouse coordinates are relative, not absolute. The Caps Lock key is handled in a special manner. It generates a keycode only when it is pressed, not when it is released. However, the up/down bit (80 hex) is still used and reported. If pressing the Caps Lock key causes the LED to light, keycode 62 (Caps Lock pressed) is sent. If pressing the Caps Lock key extinguishes the LED, keycode 190 (Caps Lock released) is sent. In effect, the keyboard reports this key as held down until it is struck again. The and fields are filled by some classes with an Intuition address: x and fields contain the system time stamp taken at the time the event occurred. These values are stored as longwords by the system. With RAW keyboard input selected, keys will no longer return a simple one-character "A" to "Z" but will instead return raw keycode reports of the form: 1;0; ; ; ; ; ; | For example, if the user pressed and released the A key with the left Shift and right Amiga keys also pressed, you might receive the following data: 1;0;32;32769;14593;5889;421939940;316673| 1;0;160;32769;0;0;421939991;816683| The field is an ASCII decimal value representing the key pressed or released. Adding 128 to the pressed key code will result in the released keycode. The and fields are relevant for the interpretation of keys which are modifiable by dead-keys (see " Dead-Class Keys " section). The field shows the previous key pressed. The lower byte shows the qualifier, the upper byte shows the key code. The field shows the key pressed before the previous key. The lower byte shows the qualifier, the upper byte shows the key code. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
