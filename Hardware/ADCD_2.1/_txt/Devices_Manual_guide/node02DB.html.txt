TITLE: Additional Info / Interpreting the Scan Line Data

Additional Info / Interpreting the Scan Line Data ]" border=0> If the ILBM is not HAM or HALFBRITE, then after parsing and uncompacting if necessary, you will have N planes of pixel data. Color register used for each pixel is specified by looking at each pixel thru the planes. I.e., if you have 5 planes, and the bit for a particular pixel is set in planes 0 and 3: PLANE 4 3 2 1 0 PIXEL 0 1 0 0 1 then that pixel uses color register binary 01001 = 9 The RGB value for each color register is stored in the CMAP chunk of the ILBM, starting with register 0, with each register's RGB value stored as one byte of R, one byte G, and one byte of B, with each component scaled to 8-bits. (ie. 4-bit Amiga R, G, and B components are each stored in the high nibble of a byte. The low nibble may also contain valid data if the color was stored with 8-bit-per-gun color resolution). BUT - if the picture is HAM or HALFBRITE, it is interpreted differently. === ========= Hopefully, if the picture is HAM or HALFBRITE, the package that saved it properly saved a CAMG chunk (look at a hex dump of your file with ACSII interpretation - you will see the chunks - they all start with a 4-ASCII- character chunk ID). If the picture is 6 planes deep and has no CAMG chunk, it is probably HAM. If you see a CAMG chunk, the "CAMG" is followed by the 32-bit chunk length, and then the 32-bit Amiga Viewmode flags. HAM pics with a 16-bit CAMG will have the 0x800 bit set in CAMG ViewModes. HALBRITE pics will have the 0x80 bit set. To transport a HAM or HALFBRITE picture to another machine, you must understand how HAM and HALFBRITE work on the Amiga. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
