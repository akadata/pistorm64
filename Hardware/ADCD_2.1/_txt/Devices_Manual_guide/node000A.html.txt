TITLE: 1 Introduction to Amiga System Devices / I/O Request Completion

1 Introduction to Amiga System Devices / I/O Request Completion ]" border=0> A device will set the io_Error field of the I/O request to indicate the success or failure of an operation. The indication will be either zero for success or a non-zero error code for failure. There are two types of error codes: Exec I/O and device specific. Exec I/O errors are defined in the include file exec/ errors.h ; device specific errors are defined in the include file for each device. You should always check that the operation you requested was successful. The exact method for checking io_Error can depend on whether you use DoIO() or SendIO() . In both cases, io_Error will be set when the I/O request is returned, but in the case of DoIO() , the DoIO() function itself returns the same value as io_Error. This gives you the option of checking the function return value: SerialIO->IOSer.io_Length = sizeof(ReadBuffer); SerialIO->IOSer.io_Data = ReadBuffer; SerialIO->IOSer.io_Command = CMD_READ; if (DoIO((struct IORequest *)SerialIO); printf("Read failed. Error: %ld\n",SerialIO->IOSer.io_Error); Or you can check io_Error directly: SerialIO->IOSer.io_Length = sizeof(ReadBuffer); SerialIO->IOSer.io_Data = ReadBuffer; SerialIO->IOSer.io_Command = CMD_READ; DoIO((struct IORequest *)SerialIO); if (SerialIO->IOSer.io_Error) printf("Read failed. Error: %ld\n",SerialIO->IOSer.io_Error); Keep in mind that checking io_Error is the only way that I/O requests sent by SendIO() can be checked. Testing for a failed I/O request is a minimum step, what you do beyond that depends on your application. In some instances, you may decide to resend the I/O request, and in others, you may decide to stop your application. One thing you'll almost always want to do is to inform the user that an error has occurred. Exiting The Correct Way. ------------------------ If you decide that you must prematurely end your application, you should deallocate, release, give back and let go of everything you took to run the application. In other words, you should exit gracefully. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
