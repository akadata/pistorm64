Works with the Fast File System. * This code is required reading for device driver writers. It contains * information not found elsewhere. This code is somewhat old; you probably * don't want to copy it directly. * * This example includes a task, though a task is not actually needed for * a simple ram disk. Unlike a single set of hardware registers that * may need to be shared by multiple tasks, ram can be freely shared. * This example does not show arbitration of hardware resources. * * Tested with CAPE and Metacomco * * Based on mydev.asm * 10/07/86 Modified by Lee Erickson to be a simple disk device * using RAM to simulate a disk. * 02/02/88 Modified by C. Scheppner, renamed ramdev * 09/28/88 Repaired by Bryce Nesbitt for new release * 11/02/88 More clarifications * 02/01/89 Even more clarifications & warnings * 02/22/89 START/STOP fix from Marco Papa * * Bugs: If RTF_AUTOINIT fails, library base still left in memory. * ************************************************************************* SECTION firstsection NOLIST include "exec/types.i" include "exec/devices.i" include "exec/initializers.i" include "exec/memory.i" include "exec/resident.i" include "exec/io.i" include "exec/ables.i" include "exec/errors.i" include "exec/tasks.i" include "hardware/intbits.i" include "asmsupp.i" ;standard asmsupp.i, same as used for library include "ramdev.i" IFNE AUTOMOUNT include "libraries/expansion.i" include "libraries/configvars.i" include "libraries/configregs.i" ENDC LIST ABSEXECBASE equ 4 ;Absolute location of the pointer to exec.library base ;------ These don't have to be external, but it helps some ;------ debuggers to have them globally visible XDEF Init XDEF Open XDEF Close XDEF Expunge XDEF Null XDEF myName XDEF BeginIO XDEF AbortIO ;Pull these _LVOs in from amiga.lib XLIB AddIntServer XLIB RemIntServer XLIB Debug XLIB InitStruct XLIB OpenLibrary XLIB CloseLibrary XLIB Alert XLIB FreeMem XLIB Remove XLIB AddPort XLIB AllocMem XLIB AddTask XLIB PutMsg XLIB RemTask XLIB ReplyMsg XLIB Signal XLIB GetMsg XLIB Wait XLIB WaitPort XLIB AllocSignal XLIB SetTaskPri XLIB GetCurrentBinding ;Use to get list of boards for this driver XLIB MakeDosNode XLIB AddDosNode XLIB CopyMemQuick ;Highly optimized copy function from exec.library INT_ABLES ;Macro from exec/ables.i ;----------------------------------------------------------------------- ; The first executable location.
