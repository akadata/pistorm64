A / Introduction / Standards are Good for Software Developers ]" border=0> As home computer hardware evolves into better and better media machines, the demand increases for higher quality, more detailed data. Data development gets more expensive, requires more expertise and better tools, and has to be shared across projects. Think about several ports of a product on one CD-ROM with 500M Bytes of common data! Development tools need standard interchange file formats. Imagine scanning in images of "player" shapes, transferring them to an image enhancement package, moving them to a paint program for touch up, then incorporating them into a game. Or writing a theme song with a Macintosh score editor and incorporating it into an Amiga game. The data must at times be transformed, clipped, filled out, and moved across machine kinds. Media projects will depend on data transfer from graphic, music, sound effect, animation, and script tools. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
