Additional Info / Body Compression ]" border=0> The BODY contains pixel data for the image. Width, Height, and depth (Planes) is specified in the BMHD. If the BMHD Compression byte is 0, then the scan line data is not compressed. If Compression=1, then each scan line is individually compressed as follows: More than 2 bytes the same stored as BYTE code value n from -1 to -127 followed by byte to be repeated (-n) + 1 times. Varied bytes stored as BYTE code n from 0 to 127 followed by n+1 bytes of data. The byte code -128 is a NOP. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
