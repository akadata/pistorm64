Introduction / Recording ANIMs ]" border=0> To record an ANIM will require three bitmaps - one for creation of the next frame, and two more for a "history" of the previous two frames for performing the compression calculations (e.g. the delta mode calculations). There are five frame-to-frame compression methods currently defined. The first three are mainly for historical interest. The product Aegis VideoScape 3D utilizes the third method in version 1.0, but switched to method 5 on 2.0. This is the only instance known of a commercial product generating ANIMs of any of the first three methods. The fourth method is a general short or long word compression scheme which has several options including whether the compression is horizontal or vertical, and whether or not it is XOR format. This offers a choice to the user for the optimization of file size and/or playback speed. The fifth method is the byte vertical run length encoding as designed by Jim Kent. Do not confuse this with Jim's RIFF file format which is different than ANIM. Here we utilized his compression/ decompression routines within the ANIM file structure. The following paragraphs give a general outline of each of the methods of compression currently included in this spec.
