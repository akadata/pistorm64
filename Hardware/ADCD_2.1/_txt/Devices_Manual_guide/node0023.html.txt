TITLE: 2 / Audio And System I/O Functions / BeginIO()

2 / Audio And System I/O Functions / BeginIO() ]" border=0> All the commands that you can give to the audio device should be sent by calling the BeginIO() function. This differs from other Amiga devices which generally use SendIO() or DoIO() . You should not use SendIO() or DoIO() with the audio device because these functions clear some special flags used by the audio device; this might cause audio to work incorrectly under certain circumstances. To be safe, you should always use BeginIO() with the audio device. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
