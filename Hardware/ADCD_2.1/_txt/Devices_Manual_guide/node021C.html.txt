TITLE: AIFF / Local Chunk Types / Sound Data Chunk

AIFF / Local Chunk Types / Sound Data Chunk ]" border=0> The Sound Data Chunk contains the actual sample frames. #define SoundDataID 'SSND' /* ckID for Sound Data Chunk */ typedef struct { ID ckID; long ckSize; unsigned long offset; unsigned long blockSize; unsigned char SoundData []; } SoundDataChunk; The ckID is always 'SSND'. The ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize. The offset field determines where the first sample frame in the soundData starts. The offset is in bytes. Most applications won't use offset and should set it to zero. Use for a non-zero offset is explained in the Block-Aligning Sound Data section below. The blockSize is used in conjunction with offset for block-aligning sound data. It contains the size in bytes of the blocks that sound data is aligned to. As with offset, most applications won't use blockSize and should set it to zero. More information on blockSize is in the Block-Aligning Sound Data section below. The soundData field contains the sample frames that make up the sound. The number of sample frames in the soundData is determined by the numSampleFrames field in the Common Chunk. Sample points and sample frames are explained in detail in the next section. The Sound Data Chunk is required unless the numSampleFrames field in the Common Chunk is zero. A maximum of one Sound Data Chunk may appear in a FORM AIFF. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
