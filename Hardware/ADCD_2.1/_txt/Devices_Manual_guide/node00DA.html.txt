TITLE: 6 Input Device / Input Device and Intuition

6 Input Device / Input Device and Intuition ]" border=0> There are several ways to receive information from the various devices that are part of the input device. The first way is to communicate directly with the device. This method is not recommended while the input device task is running - which is most of the time. The second way is to become a handler for the stream of events which the input device produces. That method is shown above. The third method of getting input from the input device is to retrieve the data from the console device or from the IDCMP (Intuition Direct Communications Message Port). These are the preferred methods for applications in a multitasking environment because each application can receive juts its own input (i.e., only the input which occurs when one of its window is active). See the " Intuition " chapters of Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries for more information on IDCMP messages. See the Console Device chapter of this manual for more information on console device I/O. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
