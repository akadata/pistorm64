SAMP.doc / MIDI Velocity vs. Amiga Channel Volume ]" border=0> The legal range for Midi Velocity bytes is 0 to 127. (A midi velocity of 0 should ALWAYS be interpreted as a note off). The legal range for Amiga channel volume is 0 to 64. Since this is half of the midi range, a received midi velocity should be divided by 2 and add 1 (but only AFTER checking for a received midi velocity of 0). An example of how to implement a received midi velocity in C: If ( ReceivedVelocity != 0 && ReceivedVelocity 127 ;---Check for velocity start feature ON, and direction move.b VelStart,d1 beq.s Volume ;skip the velocity offset routine if 0 bmi.s NegativeVel ;is it NEGATIVE? (128) ;---Positive velocity offset move.l d0,d1 ;duplicate velocity lsr.b #3,d1 ;divide by 8 add.b d1,d1 ;x 2 because we need to fetch a word lea VelTable,a1 ;start at table's HEAD adda.l d1,a1 ;go forward move.w (a1),d1 ;get the velocity offet adda.l d1,a0 ;where to start actual playback bra.s Volume NegativeVel: ;---Negative velocity offset move.l d0,d1 ;duplicate velocity lsr.b #3,d1 ;divide by 8 add.b d1,d1 ;x 2 because we need to fetch a word lea VelTable+30,a1 ;start at table's END suba.l d1,a1 ;go backwards move.w (a1),d1 ;get the velocity offset adda.l d1,a0 ;where to start actual playback ;---Convert Midi velocity to an Amiga volume Volume lsr.b #1,d0 ;divide by 2 addq.b #1,d0 ;an equivalent Amiga volume ;---Now a0 and d0 are the address of sample start, and volume [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
