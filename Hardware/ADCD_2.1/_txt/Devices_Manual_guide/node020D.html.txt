8SVXSEQN.FADE.doc / Optional Data Chunk SEQN ]" border=0> The optional data chunk SEQN gives the information necessary to play a sample in a sequence of defined blocks. To have a segment repeat twice, the definition occurs twice in the list. This list consists of pairs of ULONG "loop start" and "end" definitions which are offsets from the start of the waveform. The locations or values must be LONGWORD aligned (divisable by 4). To determine how many loop definitions in a given file, simply divide the SEQN chunk size by 8. E.g., if chunk size == 40 ... number of loops = (40 / 8) .. equals 5 loops. The raw data in a file might look like this... 'S-E-Q-N' [ size ] [ Loop 1 ] [ Loop 2 ] [ Loop 3 ] 5345514E 00000028 00000000 00000C00 00000000 00000C00 00000C08 00002000 ^ ^ 'Haaaallelujah..' 'Haaaallelujah..' 'Hallelujah..' ^ ^ 40 bytes decimal / 8 = 5 loop or segments [ Loop 4 ] [ Loop 5 ]'B-O-D-Y' Size Data 00000C08 00002000 00002008 00003000 424F4459 000BE974 010101010101010 'Hallelujah..' 'Halleeeelujah..' In a waveform containing SEQN chunks, the oneShotHiSamples should be set to 0 and the repeatHiSamples should equal the BODY length (divided by 2 if STEREO). Remember the locations of the start and end of each segment or loop should be LONGWORD aligned. If the waveform is Stereo, treat the values and locations in exactly the same way. In other words, if a loop starts at location 400 within a Stereo waveform, you start the sound at the 400th byte position in the left data and the 400th byte position in the right data simultaneously. #define ID_SEQN MakeID('S','E','Q','N') [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
