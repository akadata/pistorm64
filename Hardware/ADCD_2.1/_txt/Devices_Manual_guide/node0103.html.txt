TITLE: 7 / Amiga Reset Handling / Adding A Reset Handler (KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER)

7 / Amiga Reset Handling / Adding A Reset Handler (KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER) ]" border=0> The KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER command adds a custom routine to the chain of reset-handlers. Reset handlers are just like any other handler and are added to the handler list with an Interrupt structure. The priority field in the list node of the Interrupt structure establishes the sequence in which reset handlers are processed by the system. Keyboard reset handlers are currently limited to the priority values of a software interrupt, that is, values of -32, -16, 0, 16, and 32. The io_Data field of the I/O request is filled in with a pointer to the Interrupt structure and the io_Command field is set to KBD_ADDRESETHANDLER . These are the only two fields you need to initialize to add a reset handler. Any return value from the command is ignored. All keyboard reset handlers are activated if time permits. Normally, a reset handler will just signal the requisite task and return. The task then does whatever processing it needs to do and notifies the system that it is done by using the KBD_RESETHANDLERDONE command described below. Non-interference and speed are the keys to success. --------------------------------------------------- If you add your own handler to the chain, you must ensure that your handler allows the rest of reset processing to occur. Reset must continue to function. Also, if you don't execute your reset code fast enough, the system will still reboot (about 10 seconds). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
