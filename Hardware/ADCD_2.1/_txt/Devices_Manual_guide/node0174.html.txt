FTXT IFF Formatted / Appendix C. ISO/ANSI Control Sequences ]" border=0> This is a racetrack diagram of the ISO/ANSI characters and control sequences as used in FTXT CHRS chunks. line terminator ---+-----------------> LF------------------------------------------------> | |\ ESC-Seq | +---------------> ESC--------------------------+---> 0 through ~ ---> | | | | + SP through ~ -------------------------------------> | | / | +----> G1------------>+ | |\ ShiftToG2 | +---------------> G0----------------------> (produces a G2 character) | |\ ShiftToG3 | +---------------> G0----------------------> (produces a G3 character) | | |\ CSI-Seq | +--------------> CSI--+-----------------------+----> @ through ~ ---> | | | | + DCS, OSC,-+-----------------------+----------> ST ------> | PM, APC | | \ | + G1 ------> | \ discard +--------------------> any other character--------------------------> Of the various control sequences, only CSI-Seq is used for FTXT character formatting information. The others are reserved for future use and for compatibility with ISO/ANSI standards. Certain character sequences are syntactically malformed, e.g., CSI followed by a C0, C1, or G1 character. Writer programs should not generate reserved or malformed sequences and reader programs should skip them. Consult the ISO/ANSI standards for the meaning of the CSI-Seq control sequences. The two character set shifts SS2 and SS3 may be used when the graphic character groups G2 and G3 become standardized. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
