6 / Setting The Conditions For A Mouse Port Report ]" border=0> You set the conditions for a mouse port report by passing an IOStdReq to the device with IND_SETMTRIG set in io_Command, the address of a GamePortTrigger structure set in io_Data and the length of the structure set in io_Length. struct GamePortTrigger InputTR; InputIO->io_Data = (APTR)InputTR; /* set trigger conditions */ InputIO->io_Command = IND_SETMTRIG; /* from InputTR */ InputIO->io_Length = sizeof(struct GamePortTrigger); DoIO(InputIO); The information needed for mouse port report setting is contained in a GamePortTrigger data structure which is defined in the include file devices/ gameport.h . struct GamePortTrigger { UWORD gpt_Keys; /* key transition triggers */ UWORD gpt_Timeout; /* time trigger (vertical blank units) */ UWORD gpt_XDelta; /* X distance trigger */ UWORD gpt_YDelta; /* Y distance trigger */ }; See the Gameport Device chapter of this manual for a full description of setting mouse port trigger conditions.
