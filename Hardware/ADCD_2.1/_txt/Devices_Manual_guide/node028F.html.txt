SAMP.doc / Similarities and Differences from the 8SVX Form ]" border=0> Like "8SVX", this new format uses headers to separate the various sections of the sound file into chunks. Some of the chunks are exactly the same since there wasn't a need to improve them. The chunks that remain unchanged are as follows: "(c) " "AUTH" "ANNO" Since these properties are all described in the original "8SVX" document, please refer to that for a description of these chunks and their uses. Like the "8SVX" form, none of these chunks are required to be in a sound file. If they do appear, they must be padded out to an even number of bytes. Furthermore, two "8SVX" chunks no longer exist as they have been incorpo- rated into the "BODY" chunk. They are: "ATAK" "RLSE" Since each wave can be completely different than the other waves in the sound file (one wave might be middle C on a piano, and another might be a snare drum hit), it is necessary for each wave to have its own envelope description, and name. The major changes from the "8SVX" format are in the "MHDR", "NAME", and "BODY" chunks. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
