TITLE: 3 Clipboard Device / Device Interface

3 Clipboard Device / Device Interface ]" border=0> The clipboard device operates like the other Amiga devices. To use it, you must first open the clipboard device, then send I/O requests to it, and then close it when finished. See " Introduction to Amiga System Devices " chapter for general information on device usage. struct IOClipReq { struct Message io_Message; struct Device *io_Device; /* device node pointer */ struct Unit *io_Unit; /* unit (driver private)*/ UWORD io_Command; /* device command */ UBYTE io_Flags; /* including QUICK and SATISFY */ BYTE io_Error; /* error or warning num */ ULONG io_Actual; /* number of bytes transferred */ ULONG io_Length; /* number of bytes requested */ STRPTR io_Data; /* either clip stream or post port */ ULONG io_Offset; /* offset in clip stream */ LONG io_ClipID; /* ordinal clip identifier */ }; See the include file devices/ clipboard.h for the complete structure definition. The clipboard device I/O request, IOClipReq, looks like a standard IORequest structure except for the addition of the io_ClipID field, which is used by the device to identify clips. It must be set to zero by the application for a post or an initial write or read, but preserved for subsequent writes or reads, as the clipboard device uses this field internally for bookkeeping purposes.
