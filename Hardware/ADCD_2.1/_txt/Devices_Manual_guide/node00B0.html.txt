5 Gameport Device / Device Interface ]" border=0> The gameport device operates like the other Amiga devices. To use it, you must first open the gameport device, then send I/O requests to it, and then close it when finished. See the " Introduction to Amiga System Devices " chapter for general information on device usage. The I/O request used by the gameport device is called IOStdReq. struct IOStdReq { struct Message io_Message; struct Device *io_Device; /* device node pointer */ struct Unit *io_Unit; /* unit (driver private)*/ UWORD io_Command; /* device command */ UBYTE io_Flags; BYTE io_Error; /* error or warning num */ ULONG io_Actual; /* actual number of bytes transferred */ ULONG io_Length; /* requested number bytes transferred*/ APTR io_Data; /* points to data area */ ULONG io_Offset; /* offset for block structured devices */ }; See the include file exec/ io.h for the complete structure definition.
