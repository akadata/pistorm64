TITLE: 4 Console Device / Copy and Paste Support

4 Console Device / Copy and Paste Support ]" border=0> As noted above, opening the console device with a unit of CONU_SNIPMAP allows the user to drag-select text with the mouse and copy the selection with Right-Amiga-C. Internally, the snip is copied to a private buffer managed by the console device where it can be copied to other console device windows by pressing Right-Amiga-V. However, your application should assume that the user is running the Conclip" utility which is part of the standard Workbench 2.0 environment. Conclip copies snips from the console device to the clipboard device where they can be used by other applications which support reading from the clipboard. When Conclip is running and the user presses Right-Amiga-V, the console device puts an escape sequence in your read stream - 0 v (Hex 9B 30 20 76) - which tells you that the user wants to paste text from the clipboard. Upon receipt of this sequence, your application should read the contents of the clipboard device, make a copy of any text found there and then release the clipboard so that it can be used by other applications. See the " Clipboard Device " chapter for more information on reading data from it. You paste what you read from the clipboard by using successive writes to the console. In order to avoid problems with excessively long data in the clipboard, you should limit the size of writes to something reasonable. (We define reasonable as no more than 1K per write with the ideal amount being 256 bytes.) You should also continue to monitor the console read stream for additional use input, paster requests and, possibly, RAW INPUT EVENTS while you are doing this. You should not open a character mapped console unit with COPY capability if you are unable to support PASTE from the clipboard device. The user will reasonably expect to be able to PASTE into windows from which a COPY can be done. Keep in mind that users do make mistakes, so an UNDO mechanism for aborting a PASTE is highly desirable - particularly if the user has just accidentally pasted text into an application like a terminal program which is sending data at a slow rate. Use CON:, You'll Be Glad You Did. --------------------------------- It is highly recommended that you consider using the console-handler (CON:) if you want a console window with COPY and PASTE capablilities. CON: provides you with free PASTE support and is considerably easier to open and use than using the console device directly. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
