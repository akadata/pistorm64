Details / EXTR sub-sub-chunks ]" border=0> MTRX - size 60 VECTOR Translate; ; translation vector VECTOR Scale; ; X,Y and Z scaling factors MATRIX Rotate; ; rotation matrix The translation vector is i world coordinates. The scaling factors are with respect to local axes. The rotation matrix is with respect to the world axes, and it should be a "unit matrix". The rotation is such that a rotated axis's X,Y, and Z components are the dot products of the MATRIX's I,J, and K vectors with the un-rotated axis vector. LOAD - size 80 BYTE Filename[80]; ; the name of the external file This chunk contains the name of an external object file. The external file should be a FORM TDDD file. It may contain an any number of objects possibly grouped into heirarchy(ies). Both of these chunks are required. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
