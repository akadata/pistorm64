TITLE: Standard Data and Property Chunks / Data Chunk CHRS

Standard Data and Property Chunks / Data Chunk CHRS ]" border=0> A CHRS chunk contains a sequence of 8-bit characters abiding by the ISO/ANSI standards cited at the start of this document. This includes the character set and control sequences as described above and summarized in Appendix A and Appendix C . A FORM FTXT may contain any number of CHRS chunks. Taken together, they represent a single stream of textual information. That is, the contents of CHRS chunks are effectively concatenated except that (1) each control sequence must be completely within a single CHRS chunk, and (2) any formatting property chunks appearing between two CHRS chunks affects the formatting of the latter chunk's text. Any formatting settings set by control sequences inside a CHRS carry over to the next CHRS in the same FORM FTXT . All formatting properties stop at the end of the FORM since IFF specifies that adjacent FORMs are independent of each other (although not independent of any properties inherited from an enclosing LIST or FORM).
