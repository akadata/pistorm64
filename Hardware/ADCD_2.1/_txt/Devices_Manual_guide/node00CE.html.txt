6 / Device Interface / Input Device Event Types ]" border=0> The input device is automatically opened by the console device when the system boots. When the input device is opened, a task named "input.device" is started. The input device task communicates directly with the keyboard device to obtain raw key events. It also communicates with the gameport device to obtain mouse button and mouse movement events and with the timer device to obtain time events. In addition to these events, you can add your own input events to the input device, to be fed to the handler chain (see below). The keyboard device is accessible directly (see the Keyboard Device chapter). However, once the input.device task has started, you should not read events from the keyboard device directly, since doing so will deprive the input device of the events and confuse key repeating. The gameport device has two units. As you view the Amiga, looking at the gameport connectors, the left connector is assigned as the primary mouse input for Intuition and contributes gameport input events to the input event stream. The right connector is handled by the other gameport unit and is currently unassigned. While the input device task is running, that task expects to read the input from the left connector. Direct use of the gameport device is covered in the Gameport Device chapter of this manual. The timer device is used to generate time events for the input device. It is also used to control key repeat rate and key repeat threshold. The timer device is a shared-access device and is described in Timer Device chapter of this manual. The device-specific commands are described below. First though, it may be helpful to consider the types of input events that the input device deals with. An input event is a data structure that describes the following: * The class of the event-often describes the device that generated the event. * The subclass of the event-space for more information if needed. * The code-keycode if keyboard, button information if mouse, others. * A qualifier such as "Alt key also down,"or "key repeat active". * A position field that contains a data address or a mouse position count. * A time stamp, to determine the sequence in which the events occurred. * A link-field by which input events are linked together. * The class, subclass, code and qualifier of the previous down key. The full definitions for each field can be found in the include file devices/ inputevent.h . You can find more information about input events in the Gameport Device and Console Device chapters of this manual. The various types of input events are listed below. Input Device Event Types ------------------------ IECLASS_NULL A NOP input event IECLASS_RAWKEY A raw keycode from the keyboard device IECLASS_RAWMOUSE The raw mouse report from the gameport device IECLASS_EVENT A private console event IECLASS_POINTERPOS A pointer position report IECLASS_TIMER A timer event IECLASS_GADGETDOWN Select button pressed down over a gadget (address in ie_EventAddress) IECLASS_GADGETUP Select button released over the same gadget (address in ie_EventAddress) IECLASS_REQUESTER Some requester activity has taken place. IECLASS_MENULIST This is a menu number transmission (menu number is in ie_Code) IECLASS_CLOSEWINDOW User has selected active window's Close Gadget IECLASS_SIZEWINDOW This window has a new size IECLASS_REFRESHWINDOW The window pointed to by ie_EventAddress needs to be refreshed IECLASS_NEWPREFS New preferences are available IECLASS_DISKREMOVED The disk has been removed IECLASS_DISKINSERTED The disk has been inserted IECLASS_ACTIVEWINDOW The window is about to be been made active IECLASS_INACTIVEWINDOW The window is about to be made inactive IECLASS_NEWPOINTERPOS Extended-function pointer position report (V36) IECLASS_MENUHELP Help key report during Menu session (V36) IECLASS_CHANGEWINDOW The Window has been modified with move, size, zoom, or change (V36) There is a difference between simply receiving an input event from a device and actually becoming a handler of an input event stream. A handler is a routine that is passed an input event list. It is up to the handler to decide if it can process the input events. If the handler does not recognize an event, it leaves it undisturbed in the event list. It All Flows Downhill. ---------------------- Handlers can themselves generate new linked lists of events which can be passed down to lower priority handlers. The InputEvent structure is used by the input device to describe an input event such as a keypress or a mouse movement. struct InputEvent { struct InputEvent *ie_NextEvent;/* the next chronological event */ UBYTE ie_Class; /* the input event class */ UBYTE ie_SubClass; /* optional subclass of the class */ UWORD ie_Code; /* the input event code */ UWORD ie_Qualifier; /* qualifiers in effect for the event*/ union { struct { WORD ie_x; /* the pointer position for event */ WORD ie_y; } ie_xy; APTR ie_addr; /* the event address */ struct { UBYTE ie_prev1DownCode;/* previous down keys for dead */ UBYTE ie_prev1DownQual;/* key translation: the ie_Code */ UBYTE ie_prev2DownCode;/* &low byte of ie_Qualifier for */ UBYTE ie_prev2DownQual;/* last & second last down keys */ } ie_dead; } ie_position; struct timeval ie_TimeStamp; /* the system tick at the event */ }; The IEPointerPixel and IEPointerTablet structures are used to set the mouse position with the IECLASS_NEWPOINTERPOS input event class. struct IEPointerPixel { struct Screen *iepp_Screen; /* pointer to an open screen */ struct { /* pixel coordinates in iepp_Screen */ WORD X; WORD Y; } iepp_Position; }; struct IEPointerTablet { struct { UWORD X; UWORD Y; } iept_Range; /* 0 is min, these are max */ struct { UWORD X; UWORD Y; } iept_Value; /* between 0 and iept_Range */ WORD iept_Pressure; /* -128 to 127 (unused, set to 0) */ }; See the include file devices/ inputevent.h for the complete structure definitions. For input device handler installation, the Interrupt structure is used. struct Interrupt { struct Node is_Node; APTR is_Data; /* server data segment */ VOID (*is_Code)(); /* server code entry */ }; See the include file exec/ interrupts.h for the complete structure definition.
