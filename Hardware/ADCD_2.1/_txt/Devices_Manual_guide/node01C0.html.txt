TITLE: ILBM IFF Interleaved Bitmap / Appendix D. ByteRun1 Run Encoding

ILBM IFF Interleaved Bitmap / Appendix D. ByteRun1 Run Encoding ]" border=0> The run encoding scheme byteRun1 is best described by pseudo code for the decoder Unpacker (called UnPackBits in the Macintosh(tm) toolbox): UnPacker: LOOP until produced the desired number of bytes Read the next source byte into n SELECT n FROM [0..127] => copy the next n+1 bytes literally [-1..-127] => replicate the next byte -n+1 times -128 => no operation ENDCASE; ENDLOOP; In the inverse routine Packer, it's best to encode a 2 byte repeat run as a replicate run except when preceded and followed by a literal run, in which case it's best to merge the three into one literal run. Always encode 3 byte repeats as replicate runs. Remember that each row of each scan line of a raster is separately packed. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
