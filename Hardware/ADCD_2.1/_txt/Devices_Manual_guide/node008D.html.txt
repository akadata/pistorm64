4 / / Set Graphic Rendition Implementation Notes ]" border=0> Previous versions of the operating system did not support the global background color sequence as is listed above. Instead, the background color was set by setting the character cell color and then clearing the screen (e.g., a FORMFEED). In fact, vacated areas of windows (vacated because of an ERASE or SCROLL) were filled in with the character cell color. This is no longer the case. Now, when an area is vacated, it is filled in with the global background color. SMART_REFRESH windows are a special case: Under V33-V34: The cell color had to be set and a FORMFEED (clear window) needed to be sent on resize or immediately to clear the window and set the background color. For example, if you took a CLI window and sent the sequence to set the cell color to something other than the default,the background color would not be changed immediately (contrary to what was expected). If you then sent a FORMFEED,the background color would change,but if you resized the window larger, you would note that the newly revealed areas were filled in with PEN 0. Under V36-V37 (non-character mapped): You need to set the global background color and do a FormFeed. The background color will then be used to fill the window, but like V33-V34, if you make the window larger, the vacated areas will be filled in with PEN 0. Under V36-V37 (character mapped): You need to set the global background color, the window is redrawn immediately (because we have the character map) and will be correctly redrawn with the global background color on subsequent resizes. The sequences in the next table are not ANSI standard sequences, they are private Amiga sequences. In these command descriptions, length, width, and offset are comprised of one or more ASCII digits, defining a decimal value. AMIGA CONSOLE CONTROL SEQUENCES Console Command Sequence of Characters(in Hex Format) ---------------------- ------------------------------------- ENABLE SCROLL(default) 9B 3E 31 68 DISABLE SCROLL 9B 3E 31 6C AUTOWRAP ON (default) 9B 3F 37 68 AUTOWRAP OFF 9B 3F 37 6C SET PAGE LENGTH 9B 74 (in character raster lines, causes console to recalculate,using current font, how many text lines will fit on the page) SET LINE LENGTH 9B 75 (in character positions, using current font, how many characters should be placed on each line) SET LEFT OFFSET 9B 78 (in raster columns, how far from the left of the window should the text begin) SET TOP OFFSET 9B 79 (in raster lines, how far from the top of the window's RastPort should the topmost line of the character begin) SET RAW EVENTS 9B 7B (set the raw input events that will trigger an INPUT EVENT REPORT. see the " Selecting Raw Input Events " section below for more details.) INPUT EVENT REPORT 9B 7C (returned by the console device in response to a raw event set by the SET RAW EVENT sequence. See the " Input Event Reports " section below for more details.) RESET RAW EVENTS 9B 7D (reset the raw events set by the SET RAW EVENT sequence. See the " Selecting Raw Input Events " section below.) SPECIAL KEY REPORT 9B 7E (returned by the console device whenever HELP, or one of the function keys or arrow keys is pressed. Some sequences do not end with 7E) SET CURSOR RENDITION 9B N 20 70 (make the cursor visible or invisible: Note-turning off the cursor increases text output speed) Invisible: 9B 30 20 70 Visible: 9B 20 70 WINDOW STATUS REQUEST 9B 30 20 71 (ask the console device to tell you the current bounds of the window, in upper and lower row and column character positions. User may have resized or repositioned it.See " Window Bounds Report " below.) WINDOW BOUNDS REPORT 9B 31 3B 31 3B (returned by the console device in 3B 72 response to a WINDOW STATUS REQUEST sequence) RIGHT AMIGA V PRESS 9B 30 20 76 (returned by the console device when the user presses RIGHT-AMIGA-V. See the " Copy and Paste Support " section below for more details.) Give Back What You Take. ------------------------ The console device normally handles the SET PAGE LENGTH, SET LINE LENGTH, SET LEFT OFFSET, and SET TOP OFFSET functions automatically. To allow it to do so again after setting your own values, send the functions without a parameter. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
