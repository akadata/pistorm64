10 / Device Interface / Important Points About Print Requests ]" border=0> * Perform printer I/O from a separate task or process It is quite reasonable for a user to expect that printing will be performed as a background operation. You should try to accommodate this expectation as much as possible. * Give the user a chance to stop Your application should always allow the user to stop a print request before it is finished. * Don't confuse aborting a print request with cancelling a page Some applications seem to offer the user the ability to abort a multi-page print request when in fact the abort is only for the current page being printed. This results in the next page being printed instead of the request being stopped. Do not do this! It only confuses the user and takes away from your application. There is nothing wrong with allowing the user to cancel a page and continue to the next page, but it should be explicit that this is the case. If you abort a print request, the entire request should be aborted. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
