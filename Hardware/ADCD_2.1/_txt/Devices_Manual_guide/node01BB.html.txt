TITLE: ILBM IFF Interleaved Bitmap / Appendix A. ILBM Regular Expression

ILBM IFF Interleaved Bitmap / Appendix A. ILBM Regular Expression ]" border=0> Here's a regular expression summary of the FORM ILBM syntax. This could be an IFF file or a part of one. ILBM ::= "FORM" #{ "ILBM" BMHD [CMAP] [GRAB] [DEST] [SPRT] [CAMG] CRNG* CCRT* [BODY] } BMHD ::= "BMHD" #{ BitMapHeader } CMAP ::= "CMAP" #{ (red green blue)* } [0] GRAB ::= "GRAB" #{ Point2D } DEST ::= "DEST" #{ DestMerge } SPRT ::= "SPRT" #{ SpritePrecedence } CAMG ::= "CAMG" #{ LONG } CRNG ::= "CRNG" #{ CRange } CCRT ::= "CCRT" #{ CycleInfo } BODY ::= "BODY" #{ UBYTE* } [0] The token "#" represents a ckSize LONG count of the following {braced} data bytes. E.g., a BMHD 's "#" should equal sizeof(BitMapHeader). Literal strings are shown in "quotes", [square bracket items] are optional, and "*" means 0 or more repetitions. A sometimes-needed pad byte is shown as "[0]". The property chunks BMHD , CMAP , GRAB , DEST , SPRT , CAMG and any CRNG and CCRT data chunks may actually be in any order but all must appear before the BODY chunk since ILBM readers usually stop as soon as they read the BODY. If any of the 6 property chunks are missing, default values are inherited from any shared properties (if the ILBM appears inside an IFF LIST with PROP s) or from the reader program's defaults. If any property appears more than once, the last occurrence before the BODY is the one that counts since that's the one that modifies the BODY. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
