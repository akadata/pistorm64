8SVXSEQN.FADE.doc / Optional Data Chunk FADE ]" border=0> The FADE chunk defines at what loop number the sound should begin to fade away to silence. It is possible to finish a sample of music in much the same way as commercial music does today. A FADE chunk consists of one ULONG value which has a number in it. This number corresponds to the loop number at which the fade should begin. eg. You may have a waveform containing 50 loops. A FADE definition of 45 will specify that once loop 45 is reached, fading to zero volume should begin. The rate at which this fade takes place is determined by the length of time left to play. The playing software should do a calculation based on the following... Length of all remaining sequences including current sequence (in bytes) divided by the current playback rate in samples per second = time remaining. Begin stepping the volume down at a rate which will hit zero volume just as the waveform finishes. The raw data in a file may look like this. 'F-A-D-E' [ Size ] Loop No. 'B-O-D-Y' Size Data.. 46414445 00000004 0000002D 424F4459 000BE974 01010101 01010101 etc ^ Start fading when loop number 45 is reached. #define ID_FADE MakeID('F','A','D','E') Although order shouldn't make much difference, it is a general rule of thumb that SEQN should come before FADE and FADE should be last before the BODY. Stereo waveforms would have CHAN,SEQN,FADE,BODY in that order. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
