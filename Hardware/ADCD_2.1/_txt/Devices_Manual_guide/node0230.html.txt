AIFF.doc / AIFF / Chunk Precedence ]" border=0> Several of the local chunks for FORM AIFF may contain duplicate information. For example, the Instrument Chunk defines loop points and MIDI System Exclusive data in the MIDI Data Chunk may also define loop points. What happens if these loop points are different? How is an application supposed to loop the sound? Such conflicts are resolved by defining a precedence for chunks. This precedence is illustrated in Figure 10. Common Chunk Highest Precedence | Sound Data Chunk | Marker Chunk | Instrument Chunk | Comment Chunk | Name Chunk | Author Chunk | Copyright Chunk | Annotation Chunk | Audio Recording Chunk | MIDI Data Chunk | Application Specific Chunk Lowest Precedence Figure 10: Chunk Precedence The Common Chunk has the highest precedence, while the Application Specific Chunk has the lowest. Information in the Common Chunk always takes precedence over conflicting information in any other chunk. The Application Specific Chunk always loses in conflicts with other chunks. By looking at the chunk hierarchy, for example, one sees that the loop points in the Instrument Chunk take precedence over conflicting loop points found in the MIDI Data Chunk. It is the responsibility of applications that write data into the lower precedence chunks to make sure that the higher precedence chunks are updated accordingly. Figure 11 illustrates an example of a FORM AIFF. An Audio IFF file is simple a file containing a single FORM AIFF. The FORM AIFF is stored in the data fork of Macintosh file systems that can handle resource forks. _____________________________________________________________________ | FORM AIFF | | _____________ | | ckID |_ 'FORM' ____| | | ckSize |_ 176516 ____| | | _____________ formType |_ 'AIFF' ____| __________________________ | | | Common ckID |_ 'COMM' ____| | | | | Chunk ckSize |_ 18 ________| | | | | numChannels |_ 2 ___|_____ | | | | numSampleFrames |_ 88200 _____| | | | | sampleSize |_ 16 __|_______________________________ | | | |___________ sampleRate |_ 44100.00 ____________________________| | | | | Marker ckID |_ 'MARK' _____| | | | | Chunk ckSize |_ 34 _________| | | | | numMarkers |_ 2 ___| | | | | id |_ 1 ___|_______ | | | | position |_ 44100 ___ ___|___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ | | | | markerName | 8 |'b'|'e'|'g'|' '|'l'|'o'|'o'|'p'| 0 | | | | | id |_ 2 ___|_______ | | | | position |_ 88200 _______|___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ | | | |___________ markerName | 8 |'e'|'n'|'d'|' '|'l'|'o'|'o'|'p'| 0 | | | | | Instrument ckID |_ 'INST' ______| | | | | Chunk ckSize |_ 20 __________| | | | | baseNote | 60| | | | | detune | -3| | | | | lowNote | 57| | | | | highNote | 63| | | | | lowVelocity | 1 | | | | | highVelocity |127|__ | | | | gain |_ 6 __| | | | | sustainLoop.playMode |_ 1 __| | | | | sustainLoop.beginLoop |_ 1 __| | | | | sustainLoop.endLoop |_ 2 __| | | | | releaseLoop.playMode |_ 0 __| | | | | releaseLoop.beginLoop |_ - __| | | | |__ releaseLoop.endLoop |_ - __|__________________________________| | | | Sound ckID |_ 'SSND' ______| | | | | Data ckSize |_ 176408 ______| | | | | Chunk offset |_ 0 ___________| | | | | blockSize |_ 0 ___________| _______ _______ | | | | soundData |_ch 1 _|_ch 2 _| . . . |_ch 1 _|_ch 2 _| | | | | first sample frame 88200th sample frame | | | |_________________________________________________________________| | |_____________________________________________________________________| Figure 11: Sample FORM AIFF [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
