14 / Advanced Commands / Ejecting A Disk ]" border=0> Certain disk drive manufacturers allow software control of disk ejection. The trackdisk device provides the TD_EJECT command to tell such drives to eject a disk. You eject a disk by passing an IOExtTD to the device with TD_EJECT set in io_Command. DiskIO->iotd_Req.io_Command = TD_EJECT; DoIO((struct IORequest *)DiskIO); Read the Instruction Manual. ---------------------------- The Commodore 3.5" drives for the Amiga and most other Amiga drive manufacturers do not support software disk ejects. Attempting this command on those drives will result in an error condition. Consult the instruction manual for your disk drive to determine whether this is supported. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
