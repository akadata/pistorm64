ANIM.doc / Introduction ]" border=0> The ANIM IFF format was developed at Sparta originally for the production of animated video sequences on the Amiga computer. The intent was to be able to store, and play back, sequences of frames and to minimize both the storage space on disk (through compression) and playback time (through efficient de-compression algorithms). It was desired to maintain maximum compatibility with existing IFF formats and to be able to display the initial frame as a normal still IFF picture. Several compression schemes have been introduced in the ANIM format. Most of these are strictly of historical interest as the only one currently being placed in new code is the vertical run length encoded byte encoding developed by Jim Kent.
