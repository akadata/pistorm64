8 / How to Write Phonetically / Hints For Intelligibility ]" border=0> There are a few tricks you can use to improve the intelligibility of a sentence. Often, a polysyllabic word is more recognizable than a monosyllabic word. For instance, instead of saying huge, say enormous. The longer version contains information in every syllable, thus giving the listener a greater chance to hear it correctly. Another good practice is to keep sentences to an optimal length. Writing for reading and writing for speaking are two different things. Try not to write a sentence that cannot be easily spoken in one breath. Such a sentence tends to give the impression that the speaker has an infinite lung capacity and sounds unnatural. Try to keep sentences confined to one main idea; run-on sentences tend to lose their meaning. New terms should be highly stressed the first time they are heard. This gives the listener something to cue on, and can aid in comprehension. The insertion of the glottal stop phoneme Q at the end of a word can sometimes help prevent slurring of one word into another. When we speak, we do not pause at the end of each word, but instead transition smoothly between words. This can sometimes reduce intelligibility by eliminating word boundary cues. Placing a Q, (not the silent vowel QX) at the end of a word results in some phonological effects taking place which can restore the word boundary cues. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
