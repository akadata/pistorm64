TITLE: Nonstandard Data Chunks / CRNG

Nonstandard Data Chunks / CRNG ]" border=0> A "CRNG" chunk contains "color register range" information. It's used by Electronic Arts' Deluxe Paint program to identify a contiguous range of color registers for a "shade range" and color cycling. There can be zero or more CRNG chunks in an ILBM, but all should appear before the BODY chunk. Deluxe Paint normally writes 4 CRNG chunks in an ILBM when the user asks it to "Save Picture". typedef struct { WORD pad1; /* reserved for future use; store 0 here */ WORD rate; /* color cycle rate */ WORD flags; /* see below */ UBYTE low, high; /* lower and upper color registers selected */ } CRange; The bits of the flags word are interpreted as follows: if the low bit is set then the cycle is "active", and if this bit is clear it is not active. Normally, color cycling is done so that colors move to the next higher position in the cycle, with the color in the high slot moving around to the low slot. If the second bit of the flags word is set, the cycle moves in the opposite direction. As usual, the other bits of the flags word are reserved for future expansion. Here are the masks to test these bits: #define RNG_ACTIVE 1 #define RNG_REVERSE 2 The fields low and high indicate the range of color registers (color numbers) selected by this CRange. The field active indicates whether color cycling is on or off. Zero means off. The field rate determines the speed at which the colors will step when color cycling is on. The units are such that a rate of 60 steps per second is represented as 2^14 = 16384. Slower rates can be obtained by linear scaling: for 30 steps/second, rate = 8192; for 1 step/second, rate = 16384/60 * 273. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
