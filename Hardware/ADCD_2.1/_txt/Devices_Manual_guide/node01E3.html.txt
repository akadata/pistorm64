TITLE: Data Sections / Group FORM

Data Sections / Group FORM ]" border=0> A data section is a chunk with ckID " FORM " and this arrangement: FORM ::= "FORM" #{ FormType (LocalChunk | FORM | LIST | CAT)* } FormType ::= ID LocalChunk ::= Property | Chunk The ID " FORM " is a syntactic keyword like "struct" in C. Think of a "struct ILBM " containing a field " CMAP ". If you see "FORM" you will know to expect a FORM type ID (the structure name, " ILBM " in this example) and a particular contents arrangement or "syntax" (local chunk , FORMs, LIST s, and CAT ). A "FORM ILBM", in particular, might contain a local chunk "CMAP", an "ILBM.CMAP" (to use a qualified name). So the chunk ID " FORM " indicates a data section. It implies that the chunk contains an ID and some number of nested chunks. In reading a FORM, like any other chunk, programs must respect its ckSize as a virtual end-of-file for reading its contents, even if they're truncated. The FORM type is a restricted ID that may not contain lower case letters or punctuation characters. (Cf. Type IDs. Cf. Single Purpose Files.) The type-specific information in a FORM is composed of its "local chunk s": data properties and other chunk s. Each FORM type is a local name space for local chunk IDs. So " CMAP " local chunk s in other FORM types may be unrelated to "ILBM.CMA"". More than that, each FORM type defines semantic scope. If you know what a FORM ILBM is, you will know what an ILBM. CMAP is. Local chunk s defined when the FORM type is designed (and therefore known to all clients of this type) are called "standard" while specialized ones added later are "nonstandard". Among the local chunk s, property chunks give settings for various details like text font while the other chunks supply the essential information. This distinction is not clear cut. A property setting can be cancelled by a later setting of the same property. E.g., in the sequence: prop1 = x (Data A) prop1 = z prop1 = y (Data B) prop1 is = x for Data A, and y for Data B. The setting prop1 = z has no effect. For clarity, the universally reserved chunk IDs " LIST ", " FORM ", " PROP ", " CAT ", " ", "LIS1" through "LIS9", "FOR1" through "FOR9", and "CAT1" through "CAT9" may not be FORM type IDs. Part 5, below, talks about grouping FORM s into LIST s and CAT s. They let you group a bunch of FORMs but don't impose any particular meaning or constraints on the grouping. Read on.
