AIFF.doc / AIFF / The Text Chunks, Name, Author, Copyright, Annotation ]" border=0> These four chunks are included in the definition of every "EA IFF 85" file. All are text chunks; their data portion consists solely of text. Each of these chunks is optional. #define NameID 'NAME' /* ckID for Name Chunk */ #define NameID 'AUTH' /* ckID for Author Chunk */ #define NameID '(c) ' /* ckID for Copyright Chunk */ #define NameID 'ANNO' /* ckID for Annotation Chunk */ typedef struct { ID ckID; long ckSize; char text[]; }TextChunk; The ckID is either 'NAME', 'AUTH', '(c) ', or 'ANNO' depending on whether the chunk is a Name Chunk, Author Chunk, Copyright Chunk, or Annotation Chunk, respectively. For the Copyright Chunk, the 'c' is lowercase and there is a space (0x20) after the close parenthesis. The ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in this case the text. The text field contains pure ASCII characters. it is not a pstring or a C string. The number of characters in text is determined by ckSize. The contents of text depend on the chunk, as described below: Name Chunk Author Chunk Copyright Chunk Annotation Chunk [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
