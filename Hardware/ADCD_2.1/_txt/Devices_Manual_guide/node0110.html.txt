TITLE: 15 Resources / Misc Resource

15 Resources / Misc Resource ]" border=0> The misc resource oversees usage of the serial data port, the serial communication bits, the parallel data and handshake port, and the parallel communication bits. Before using serial or parallel port hardware, it first must be acquired from the misc resource. The misc resource provides two functions for allocating and freeing the serial and parallel hardware. Misc Resource Functions ------------------------ AllocMiscResource() Allocate one of the serial or parallel misc resources. FreeMiscResource() Deallocate one of the serial or parallel misc resources. Once you've successfully allocated one of the misc resources, you are free to write directly to its hardware locations. Information on the serial and parallel hardware can be found in the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual and the hardware/ custom.h include file. The two examples below are assembly and C versions of the same code for locking the serial misc resources and waiting for CTRL-C to be pressed before releasing them.
