SAMP.doc / Making the Velocity Table ]" border=0> The 16 entries in the velocity table should be within the oneShot portion of the sample (ie not in the looping portion). THe first offset, VelTable[0] should be set to zero (in order to play back from the beginning of the data). The subsequent values should be increasing numbers. If you are using a graphic editor, try choosing offsets that will keep you within the initial attack portion of the wave. In practice, these values will be relatively close together within the wave. Always set the offsets so that when they are added to the sample start point, the resulting address points to a sample value of zero (a zero crossing point). This will eliminate pops and clicks at the beginning of the playback. In addition, the start of the wave should be on a sample with a value of zero. The last sample of the oneShot portion and the first sample of the looping portion should be approximately equal, (or zero points). The same is true of the first and last samples of the looping portion. Finally, try to keep the slopes of the end of the oneShot, the beginning of the looping, and the end of the looping section, approximately equal. All this will eliminate noise on the audio output and provide "seamless" looping. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
