TITLE: 10 / / Writing An Alphanumeric Printer Driver / Command Table

10 / / Writing An Alphanumeric Printer Driver / Command Table ]" border=0> The CommandTable is used to convert all escape codes that can be handled by simple substitution. It has one entry per ANSI command supported by the printer driver. When you are creating a custom CommandTable, you must maintain the order of the commands in the same sequence as that shown in devices/ printer.h . By placing the specific codes for your printer in the proper positions, the conversion takes place automatically. Octal knows NULL. ----------------- If the code for your printer requires a decimal 0 (an ASCII NULL character), you enter this NULL into the CommandTable as octal 376 (decimal 254). Placing an octal value of 377 (255 decimal) in a position in the command table indicates to the printer device that no simple conversion is available on this printer for this ANSI command. For example, if a daisy-wheel printer does not have a foreign character set, 377 octal (255 decimal) is placed in that position in the command table. However, 377 in a position can also mean that the ANSI command is to be handled by code located in the DoSpecial() function. For future compatibility all printer commands should be present in the command table, and those not supported by the printer filled with the dummy entry 377 octal. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
