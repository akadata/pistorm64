TITLE: Standard Data and Property Chunks / Note and Rest SEvents

Standard Data and Property Chunks / Note and Rest SEvents ]" border=0> The note and rest SEvent s SID_FirstNote through SID_Rest have the following structure overlaid onto the SEvent structure: typedef struct { UBYTE tone; /* MIDI tone number 0 to 127; 128 = rest */ unsigned chord :1, /* 1 = a chorded note */ tieOut :1, /* 1 = tied to the next note or chord */ nTuplet :2, /* 0 = none, 1 = triplet, 2 = quintuplet, * 3 = septuplet */ dot :1, /* dotted note; multiply duration by 3/2 */ division :3; /* basic note duration is 2^-division: 0 = * whole note, 1 = half note, 2 = quarter * note, .... 7 = 128th note */ } SNote; [Implementation details. Unsigned ":n" fields are packed into n bits in the order shown, most significant bit to least significant bit. An SNote fits into 16 bits like any other SEvent . Warning: Some compilers don't implement bit-packed fields properly. E.g., Lattice 68000 C pads a group of bit fields out to a LONG, which would make SNote take 5-bytes! In that situation, use the bit-field constants defined below.] The SNote structure describes one "note" or "rest" in a track. The field SNote.tone, which is overlaid with the SEvent.sID field, indicates the MIDI tone number (pitch) in the range 0 through 127. A value of 128 indicates a rest. The fields nTuplet, dot, and division together give the duration of the note or rest. The division gives the basic duration: whole note, half note, etc. The dot indicates if the note or rest is dotted. A dotted note is 3/2 as long as an undotted note. The value nTuplet (0 through 3) tells if this note or rest is part of an N-tuplet of order 1 (normal), 3, 5, or 7; an N-tuplet of order (2 * nTuplet + 1). A triplet note is 2/3 as long as a normal note, while a quintuplet is 4/5 as long and a septuplet is 6/7 as long. Putting these three fields together, the duration of the note or rest is 2^(-division) * {1, 3/2} * {1, 2/3, 4/5, 6/7} These three fields are contiguous so you can easily convert to your local duration encoding by using the combined 6 bits as an index into a mapping table. The field chord indicates if the note is chorded with the following note (which is supposed to have the same duration). A group of notes may be chorded together by setting the chord bit of all but the last one. (In the terminology of SSSP reference and GSCR, setting the chord bit to 1 makes the "entry delay" 0.) A monophonic-track player can simply ignore any SNote event whose chord bit is set, either by discarding it when reading the track or by skipping it when playing the track. Programs that create polyphonic tracks are expected to store the most important note of each chord last, which is the note with the 0 chord bit. This way, monophonic programs will play the most important note of the chord. The most important note might be the chord's root note or its melody note. If the field tieOut is set, the note is tied to the following note in the track if the following note has the same pitch. A group of tied notes is played as a single note whose duration is the sum of the component durations. Actually, the tie mechanism ties a group of one or more chorded notes to another group of one or more chorded notes. Every note in a tied chord should have its tieOut bit set. Of course, the chord and tieOut fields don't apply to SID_Rest SEvent s. Programs should be robust enough to ignore an unresolved tie, i.e., a note whose tieOut bit is set but isn't followed by a note of the same pitch. If that's true, monophonic-track programs can simply ignore chorded notes even in the presense of ties. That is, tied chords pose no extra problems. The following diagram shows some combinations of notes and chords tied to notes and chords. The text below the staff has a column for each SNote SEvent to show the pitch, chord bit, and tieOut bit. A treble staff with chords and ties: |` |` |` |` |` |` |` |` | | | | | | | | +--------|-____--|--------|-------|--------|-____--|-------|-____--|----+ |-------0|/____\0|-------0|-------|-------0|/ \0'------0'/ \0|----| |-------0|/____\0|-------0|-____--|-------0|----------------------0|----| |-------0'/ \0'-------0'/ \0'-------0'----------------------0'----| +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ Corresponding SNote values in the TRAK chunk: Pitch: D B G D B G D B G G D B G B B D B G chord: c c - c c - c c - - c c - - - c c - tieOut: t t t - - - t t t - t t t - t - - - If you read the above track into a monophonic-track program, it'll strip out the chorded notes and ignore unresolved ties. You'll end up with: |` |` | | +--------|`------|`-------|`------|`-------|`------|-------|-------|`---+ |--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|------0'------0'-------|----| |--------|-____--|--------|-____--|--------|-----------------------|----| |-------0'/ \0'-------0'/ \0'-------0'----------------------0'----| +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ Pitch: G G G G G B B G chord: - - - - - - - - tieOut: t - t - (t) - (t) - A rest event (sID = SID_Rest) has the same SEvent.data field as a note. It tells the duration of the rest. The chord and tieOut fields of rest events are ignored. Within a TRAK chunk, note and rest events appear in time order. Instead of the bit-packed structure SNote, it might be easier to assemble data values by or-ing constants and to disassemble them by masking and shifting. In that case, use the following definitions. #define noteChord (1 SEvent types are optional. A writer program doesn't have to generate them. A reader program can safely ignore them.
