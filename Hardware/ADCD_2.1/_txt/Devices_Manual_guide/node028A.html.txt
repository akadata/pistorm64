A / IFF Third Party Public Form and Chunk Specification / RGBN-RGB8.doc ]" border=0> RGB image forms, Turbo Silver (Impulse) FORM RGBN and FORM RGB8 ----------------------- RGBN and RGB8 files are used in Impulse's Turbo Silver and Imagine. They are almost identical to FORM ILBM's except for the BODY chunk and slight differences in the BMHD chunk. A CAMG chunk IS REQUIRED. The BMHD chunk specfies the number of bitplanes as 13 for type RGBN and 25 for type RGB8, and the compression type as 4. The FORM RGBN uses 12 bit RGB values, and the FORM RGB8 uses 24 bit RGB values. The BODY chunk contains RGB values, a "genlock" bit, and repeat counts. In Silver, when "genlock" bit is set, a "zero color" is written into the bitplanes for genlock video to show through. In Diamond and Light24 (Impulse 12 & 24 bit paint programs), the genlock bit is ignored if the file is loaded as a picture (and the RGB color is used instead), and if the file is loaded as a brush the genlock bit marks pixels that are not part of the brush. For both RGBN and RGB8 body chunks, each RGB value always has a repeat count. The values are written in different formats depending on the magnitude of the repeat count.
