8 / How to Write Phonetically for Narrator / Phonetic Spelling ]" border=0> Utterances are usually written phonetically using an alphabet of symbols known as IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet). This alphabet is found at the front of most good dictionaries. The symbols can be hard to learn and were not readily available on computer keyboards, so the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) came up with the ARPABET, a way of representing each symbol using one or two upper case letters. Narrator uses an expanded version of the ARPABET to specify phonetic sounds. A phonetic sound, or phoneme, is a basic speech sound, a speech atom. Working backwards: sentences can be broken into words, words into syllables, and syllables into phonemes. The word cat has three letters and (coincidentally) three phonemes. Looking at the table of phonemes we find the three sounds that make up the word cat. They are the phonemes K, AE, and T, written as KAET. The word cent translates as SEHNT. Notice that both words begin with the letter c, but because they are pronounced differently they have different phonetic spellings. These examples introduce a very important concept of phonetic spelling: spell it like it sounds, not like it looks.
