AIFF.doc / AIFF / The Application Specific Chunk ]" border=0> The Application Specific Chunk can be used for any purposes whatsoever by developers and application authors. For example, an application that edits sounds might want to use this chunk to store editor state parameters such as magnification levels, last cursor position, etc. #define ApplicationSpecificID 'APPL' /* ckID for Application */ /* Specific Chunk. */ typedef struct { ID ckID; long ckSize; OSType applicationSignature; char data[]; } ApplicationSpecificChunk; The ckID is always 'APPL'. The ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize. The applicationSignature identifies a particular application. For Macintosh applications, this will be the application's four character signature. The OSType field is used by applications which run on platforms from Apple Computer, Inc. For the Apple II, the OStype field should be set to 'pdos'. For the Macintosh, this field should be set to the four character signature as registered with Apple Technical Support. The data field is the data specific to the application. The Application Specific Chunk is optional. Any number of Application Specific Chunks may exist in a single FORM AIFF.
