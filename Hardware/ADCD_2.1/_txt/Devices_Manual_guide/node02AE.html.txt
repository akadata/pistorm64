TITLE: Background / Classical Event Durations

Background / Classical Event Durations ]" border=0> SMUS is geared for "classical" scores, not free-form performances. So its event durations are classical (whole note, dotted quarter rest, etc.). SMUS can tie notes together to build a "note event" with an unusual event duration. The set of useful classical durations is very small. So SMUS needs only a handful of bits to encode an event duration. This is very compact. It's also very easy to display in Common Music Notation (CMN). [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
