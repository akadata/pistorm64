TITLE: Details / INFO sub-chunks

Details / INFO sub-chunks ]" border=0> BRSH - size 82 WORD Number; ; Brush number (between 0 and 7) CHAR Filename[80]; ; IFF ILBM filename There may be more than one of these. STNC - size 82 Same format as BRSH chunk. TXTR - size 82 Same format as BRSH chunk. The Filename field is the name of a code module that can be loaded with LoadSeg(). OBSV - size 28 VECTOR Camera; ; Camera position VECTOR Rotate; ; Camera rotation angles FRACT Focal; ; Camera focal length This tells where the camera is, how it is aimed, and its focal length. The rotation angles are in degrees, and specify rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes. The camera looks down its own Y axis, with the top of the picture in the direction of the Z axis. If the rotation angles are all zero, its axes are aligned with the world coordinate axes. The rotations are performed in the order ZXY about the camera axes. A positive angle rotates Y toward Z, Z toward X, and X toward Y for rotations about the X, Y, and Z axes respectively. To understand the focal length, imagine a 320 x 200 pixel rectangle perpendicular to, and centered on the camera's Y axis. Any objects in the infinite rectangular cone defined by the camera position and the 4 corners of the rectangle will appear in the picture. OTRK - size 18 BYTE Trackname[18]; This chunk specifies the name of an object that the camera is "tracked" to. If the name is NULL, the camera doesn't track Otherwise, if the object is moved inside Turbo Silver, the camera will follow it. OSTR - size 56 STORY CStory; ; a STORY structure for the camera The story structure is defined above. FADE - size 12 FRACT FadeAt; ; distance to start fade FRACT FadeBy; ; distance of total fade BYTE pad; ; pad byte - must be zero COLOR FadeTo; ; RGB color to fade to SKYC - size 8 BYTE pad; ; pad byte - must be zero COLOR Horizon; ; horizon color BYTE pad; ; pad byte - must be zero COLOR Zenith; ; zenith color AMBI - size 4 BYTE pad; ; pad byte - must be zero COLOR Ambient; ; abmient light color GLB0 - size 8 BYTE Props[8]; ; an array of 8 "global properties" used ; by Turbo Silver. Props[0] - GLB_EDGING ; edge level (globals requester) Props[1] - GLB_PERTURB ; perturbance (globals requester) Props[2] - GLB_SKY_BLEND ; sky blending factor (0-255) Props[3] - GLB_LENS ; lens type (see below) Props[4] - GLB_FADE ; flag - Sharp/Fuzzy focus (globals) Props[5] - GLB_SIZE ; "apparant size" (see below) Props[6] - GLB_RESOLVE ; resolve depth (globals requester) Props[7] - GLB_EXTRA ; flag - genlock sky on/off The edging and perturbance values control the heuristics in ray tracing. The sky blending factor is zero for no blending, and 255 for full blending. The lens type is a number from 0-4, corresponding to the boxes in the "camera" requester, and correspond to 0) Manual, 1) Wide angle, 2) Normal, 3) Telephoto, and 4) Custom. It is used in setting the camera's focal length if the camera is tracked to an object. The Sharp/Fuzzy flag turns the "fade" feature on and off - non-zero means on. The "apparant size" parameter is 100 times the "custom size" parameter in the camera requester. And is used to set the focal length for a custom lens. The "resolve depth" controls the number of rays the ray tracer will shoot for a single pixel. Each reflective/refractive ray increments the depth counter, and the count is never allowed to reach the "resolve depth". If both a reflective and a refractive ray are traced, each ray gets its own version of the count - so theoretically, a resolve depth of 4 could allow much more than 4 rays to be traced. The "genlock sky" flag controls whether the sky will be colored, or set to the genlock color (color 0 - black) in the final picture. All of the INFO sub-chunks are optional, as is the INFO chunk. Default values are supplied if the chunks are not present. The defaults are: no brushes, stencils, or textures defined; no story for the camera; horizon and zenith and ambient light colors set to black; fade color set to (80,80,80); un-rotated, un-tracked camera at (-100, -100, 100); and global properties array set to [30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 100, 8, 0].
