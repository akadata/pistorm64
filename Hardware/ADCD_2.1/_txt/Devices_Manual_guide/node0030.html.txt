2 / Allocation and Arbitration Commands / ADCMD_SETPREC ]" border=0> This command changes the precedence of an allocated channel. As an example of the use of ADCMD_SETPREC , assume that you are making the sound of a chime that takes a long time to decay. It is important that user hears the chime but not so important that he hears it decay all the way. You could lower precedence after the initial attack portion of the sound to let another program steal the channel. You can also set the precedence to maximum (127) if you do not want the channel(s) stolen from you. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
