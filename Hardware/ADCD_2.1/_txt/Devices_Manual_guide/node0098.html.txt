TITLE: 4 Console Device / Console Device Caveats

4 Console Device / Console Device Caveats ]" border=0> * Only one console unit can be attached per window. Sharing a console window must be done at a level higher than the device. * Do not mix graphics.library calls with console rendering in the same areas of a window. It is permissible to send console sequences to adjust the area in which console renders, and use graphics.library calls to render outside of the area console is using. For example, do not render text with console sequences and scroll using the graphics.library ScrollRaster() function. * The character map feature is private and cannot be accessed by the programmer. Implementation details and behaviors of the character map my change in the future. * Do not use an IDCMP with character mapped consoles. All Intuition messages should be obtained via RAW INPUT EVENTS from the console device. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
