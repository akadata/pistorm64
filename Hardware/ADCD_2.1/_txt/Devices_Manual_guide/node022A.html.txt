TITLE: AIFF / The Comments Chunk / Comments Chunk Format

AIFF / The Comments Chunk / Comments Chunk Format ]" border=0> #define CommentID 'COMT' /* ckID for Comments Chunk */ typedef struct { ID ckID; long ckSize; unsigned short numComments; Comment comments[]; }CommentsChunk; The ckID is always 'COMT'. The ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize. The numComments field contains the number of comments in the Comments Chunk. This is followed by the comments themselves. Comments are always even numbers of bytes in length, so there is no padding between comments in the Comments Chunk. The Comments Chunk is optional. No more than one Comments Chunk may appear in a single FORM AIFF. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
