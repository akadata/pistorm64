10 / Device Interface / Opening The Printer Device ]" border=0> Three primary steps are required to open the printer device: * Create a message port using CreatePort() . Reply messages from the device must be directed to a message port. * Create an extended I/O request structure of type printerIO with the CreateExtIO() function. This means that one memory area can be used to represent three distinct forms of memory layout for the three different types of data structures that must be used to pass commands to the printer device. By using CreateExtIO(), you automatically allocate enough memory to hold the largest structure in the union statement. * Open the printer device. Call OpenDevice() , passing the I/O request. union printerIO { struct IOStdReq ios; struct IODRPReq iodrp; struct IOPrtCmdReq iopc; }; struct MsgPort *PrintMP; /* Message port pointer */ union printerIO *PrintIO; /* I/O request pointer */ if (PrintMP=CreateMsgPort() ) if (PrintIO=(union printerIO *) CreateExtIO(PrintMP,sizeof(union printerIO)) ) if (OpenDevice("printer.device",0L,(struct IORequest *)PrintIO,0)) printf("printer.device did not open\n"); The printer device automatically fills in default settings for all printer device parameters from Preferences. In addition, information about the printer itself is placed into the appropriate fields of printerIO . (See the Obtaining Printer Specific Data section below.) Pre-V36 Tasks and OpenDevice() . ------------------------------- Tasks in pre-V36 versions of the operating system are not able to safely OpenDevice() the printer device because it may be necessary to load it in from disk, something only a process could do under pre-V36. V36 and higher versions of the operating system do not have such a limitation. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
