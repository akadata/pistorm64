15 Resources / Potgo Resource ]" border=0> The potgo resource is used to get control of the hardware POTGO register connected to the proportional I/O pins on the game controller ports. There are two registers, POTGO (write-only) and POTINP (read-only). These pins could also be used for digital I/O. The potgo resource provides three functions for working with the POTGO hardware. Potgo Resource Functions ------------------------ AllocPotBits() Allocate bits in the POTGO register. FreePotBits() Free previously allocated bits in the POTGO register. WritePotgo() Set and clear bits in the POTGO register. The bits must have been allocated before calling this function. The example program shown below demonstrates how to use the ptogo resource to track mouse button presses on port 1. Read_Potinp.c Additional programming information on the potgo resource can be found in the include files and the Autodocs for the potgo resource.
