TITLE: 10 / / Writing An Alphanumeric Printer Driver / DoSpecial()

10 / / Writing An Alphanumeric Printer Driver / DoSpecial() ]" border=0> The DoSpecial() function is meant to implement all the ANSI functions that cannot be done by simple substitution, but can be handled by a more complex sequence of control characters sent to the printer. These are functions that need parameter conversion, read values from Preferences, and so on. Complete routines can also be placed in dospecial.c. For instance, in a driver for a page oriented-printer such as the HP LaserJet, the dummy Close() routine from the init.asm file would be replaced by a real Close() routine in dospecial.c. This close routine would handle ejecting the paper after text has been sent to the printer and the printer has been closed. The DoSpecial() function is set up as follows: #include "exec/types.h" #include "devices/printer.h" #include "devices/prtbase.h" extern struct PrinterData *PD; DoSpecial(command,outputBuffer,vline,currentVMI,crlfFlag,Parms) UBYTE outputBuffer[]; UWORD *command; BYTE *vline; BYTE *currentVMI; BYTE *crlfFlag; UBYTE Parms[]; { /* code begins here... */ where command points to the command number. The devices/ printer.h file contains the definitions for the routines to use (aRIN is initialize, and so on). vline points to the value for the current line position. currentVMI points to the value for the current line spacing. crlfFlag points to the setting of the "add line feed after carriage return" flag. Parms contain whatever parameters were given with the ANSI command. outputBuffer points to the memory buffer into which the converted command is returned. Almost every printer will require an aRIN (initialize) command in DoSpecial(). This command reads the printer settings from Preferences and creates the proper control sequence for the specific printer. It also returns the character set to normal (not italicized, not bold, and so on). Other functions depend on the printer. Certain functions are implemented both in the CommandTable and in the DoSpecial() routine. These are functions such as superscript, subscript, PLU (partial line up), and PLD (partial line down), which can often be handled by a simple conversion. However, some of these functions must also adjust the printer device's line-position variable. Save the Data! -------------- Some printers lose data when sent their own reset command. For this reason, it is recommended that if the printer's own reset command is going to be used, PD->pd_PWaitEnabled should be defined to be a character that the printer will not print. This character should be put in the reset string before and after the reset character(s) in the command table. In the EpsonX[CBM_MPS-1250] DoSpecial() function you'll see if (*command == aRIS) { /* reset command */ PD->pd_PWaitEnabled = \375; /* preserve that data! */ } while in the command table the string for reset is defined as "\\375\\033@\\375". This means that when the printer device outputs the reset string "\\033@", it will first see the "\\375", wait a second and output the reset string. While the printer is resetting, the printer device gets the second "\\375" and waits another second. This ensures that no data will be lost if a reset command is embedded in a string.
