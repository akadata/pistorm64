12 Serial Device / Querying the Serial Device ]" border=0> You query the serial device by passing an IOExtSer to the device with SDCMD_QUERY set in io_Command. The serial device will respond with the status of the serial port lines and registers, and the number of unread characters in the read buffer. UWORD Serial_Status; ULONG Unread_Chars; SerialIO->IOSer.io_Command = SDCMD_QUERY; /* indicate query */ SendIO((struct IORequest *)SerialIO); Serial_Status = SerialIO->io_Status; /* store returned status */ Unread_Chars = SerialIO->IOSer.io_Actual; /* store unread count */ The 16 status bits of the serial device are returned in io_Status; the number of unread characters is returned in io_Actual.
