TITLE: 9 / Setting Parallel Parameters / Parallel Flags (Bits for io_ParFlags)

9 / Setting Parallel Parameters / Parallel Flags (Bits for io_ParFlags) ]" border=0> The flags shown in the following table can be set to affect the operation of the parallel device. Note that the default state of all of these flags is zero. The flags are defined in the include file devices/ parallel.h . PARALLEL FLAGS (io_ParFlags) Flag Name Effect on Device Operation --------- -------------------------- PARF_EOFMODE Set this bit if you want the parallel device to check I/O characters against io_TermArray and terminate the I/O request immediately if an end-of-file character has been encountered. Note: This bit can be set and reset directly in the user's IOExtPar block without a call to PDCMD_SETPARAMS . PARF_ACKMODE Set this bit if you want to use ACK handshaking. PARF_FASTMODE Set this bit if you want to use high-speed mode for transfers to high-speed printers. This mode will send out data as long as the BUSY signal is low. The printer must be able to raise the BUSY signal within three microseconds or data will be lost. Should only be used when the device has been opened for exclusive -access. PARF_SLOWMODE Set this bit if you want to use slow -speed mode for transfers to very slow printers. Should not be used with high-speed printers. PARF_SHARED Set this bit if you want to allow other tasks to simultaneously access the parallel port. The default is exclusive access. If someone already has the port, whether for exclusive or shared access, and you ask for exclusive access, your OpenDevice() call will fail (must be modified before OpenDevice() ).
