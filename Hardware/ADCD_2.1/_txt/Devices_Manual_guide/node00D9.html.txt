TITLE: 6 Input Device / Determining the Current Qualifiers

6 Input Device / Determining the Current Qualifiers ]" border=0> Some applications need to know whether the user is holding down a qualifier key or a mouse button during an operation. To determine the current qualifiers, you call the input device function PeekQualifier() . PeekQualifier() returns what the input device considers to be the current qualifiers at the time PeekQualifier() is called (e.g., keyboard qualifiers and mouse buttons). This does not include any qualifiers which have been added, removed or otherwise modified by input handlers. In order to call the function, you must set a pointer to the input device base address. The pointer must be declared in the global data area of your program. Once you set the pointer, you can call the function. You must open the device in order to access the device base address. PeekQualifier() returns an unsigned word with bits set according to the qualifiers in effect at the time the function is called. It takes no parameters. struct Library *InputBase; /* Input device base address pointer */ VOID main(VOID) { struct IOStdReq *InputIO; /* I/O request block */ UWORD Quals; /* qualifiers */ . . . if (!OpenDevice("input.device",NULL,(struct IORequest *)InputIO,NULL)) { /* Set input device base address in InputBase */ InputBase = (struct Library *)InputIO->io_Device; /* Call the function */ Quals = PeekQualifier(); . . . CloseDevice(InputIO); } } The qualifiers returned are listed in the table below.
