intuition.library/RemakeDisplay ]" border=0> NAME RemakeDisplay -- Remake the entire Intuition display. SYNOPSIS RemakeDisplay() VOID RemakeDisplay( VOID ); FUNCTION This is the big one. This procedure remakes the entire View structure for the Intuition display. It does the equivalent of MakeScreen() for every screen in the system, and then it calls the internal equivalent of RethinkDisplay() . WARNING: This routine can take many milliseconds to run, so do not use it lightly. Calling MakeScreen() followed by RethinkDisplay() is typically a more efficient method for affecting changes to a single screen's ViewPort .
