dos.library/SetVBuf ]" border=0> NAME SetVBuf -- set buffering modes and size (V36) SYNOPSIS error = SetVBuf(fh, buff, type, size) D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 LONG SetVBuf(BPTR, STRPTR, LONG, LONG) FUNCTION Changes the buffering modes and buffer size for a filehandle. With buff == NULL, the current buffer will be deallocated and a new one of (approximately) size will be allocated. If buffer is non-NULL, it will be used for buffering and must be at least max(size,208) bytes long. If buff is NULL and size is -1, then only the buffering mode will be changed. INPUTS fh - Filehandle buff - buffer pointer for buffered I/O type - buffering mode (see ) size - size of buffer for buffered I/O (sizes less than 208 bytes will be ignored). RESULT error - 0 if successful. NOTE: opposite of most dos functions! BUGS Not implemented yet, always returns 0.
