SYNOPSIS BltTemplate(SrcTemplate, SrcX, SrcMod, rp, A0 D0:16 D1:16 A1 DstX, DstY, SizeX, SizeY) D2:16 D3:16 D4:16 D5:16 void BltTemplate(UWORD *, WORD, WORD, struct RastPort *, WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD); FUNCTION This function draws the image in the template into the RastPort in the current color and drawing mode at the specified position. The template is assumed not to overlap the destination. If the template falls outside the RastPort boundary, it is truncated to that boundary. Note: the SrcTemplate pointer should point to the "nearest" word (rounded down) of the template mask. Fine alignment of the mask is acheived by setting the SrcX bit offseet within the range of 0 to 15 decimal. INPUTS SrcTemplate - pointer to the first (nearest) word of the template mask. SrcX - x bit offset into the template mask (range 0..15). SrcMod - number of bytes per row in template mask. rp - pointer to destination RastPort . DstX, DstY - x and y coordinates of the upper left corner of the destination for the blit. SizeX, SizeY - size of the rectangle to be used as the template. NOTES o This function may use the blitter.
