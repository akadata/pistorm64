(V36) SYNOPSIS DoesContain = PointInImage( Point, Image ) D0 D0 A0 BOOL PointInImage( struct Point, struct Image * ); FUNCTION Tests whether a point is properly contained in an image. The intention of this is to provide custom gadgets a means to delegate "image mask" processing to the Image , where it belongs (superceding things like BOOLMASK). After all, a rounded rect image with a drop shadow knows more about what points are inside it than anybody else should. For traditional Intuition Images, this routine checks if the point is in the Image box (LeftEdge/RightEdge/Width/Height). INPUTS Point - Two words, X/Y packed into a LONG, with high word containing 'X'. This is what you get if you pass a Point structure (not a pointer!) using common C language parameter conventions. Image - a pointer to a standard or custom Image data object. NOTE: If 'Image' is NULL, this function returns TRUE. RESULT DoesContain - Boolean result of the test. EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS Only applies to the first image, does not follow NextImage linked list. This might be preferred. SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
