SYNOPSIS BltClear( memBlock, bytecount, flags ) a1 d0 d1 void BltClear( void *, ULONG, ULONG ); FUNCTION For memory that is local and blitter accessable, the most efficient way to clear a range of memory locations is to use the system's most efficient data mover, the blitter. This command accepts the starting location and count and clears that block to zeros. INPUTS memBloc - pointer to local memory to be cleared memBlock is assumed to be even. flags - set bit 0 to force function to wait until the blit is done. set bit 1 to use row/bytesperrow. bytecount - if (flags & 2) == 0 then even number of bytes to clear. else low 16 bits is taken as number of bytes per row and upper 16 bits taken as number of rows. This function is somewhat hardware dependant. In the rows/bytesperrow mode (with the pre-ECS blitter) rows must be [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
