keymap.library/SetKeyMapDefault ]" border=0> NAME SetKeyMapDefault -- Set the current default keymap. (V36) SYNOPSIS SetKeyMapDefault(keyMap) void SetKeyMapDefault( struct KeyMap * ); FUNCTION A pointer to key map specified is cached by the keymap library for use by MapRawKey and MapANSI when a keymap is not specified. INPUTS keyMap - a pointer to a keyMap structure. This key map must be permanently allocated: it must remain in memory till the machine is reset. It is appropriate that this keyMap be a node on the keymap.resource list. BUGS The keymap.h include file should be in the libraries/ or perhaps resources/ directory, but is in the devices/ directory for compatability reasons.
