dos.library/AssignLate ]" border=0> NAME AssignLate -- Creates an assignment to a specified path later (V36) SYNOPSIS success = AssignLate(name,path) D0 D1 D2 BOOL AssignLate(STRPTR,STRPTR) FUNCTION Sets up a assignment that is expanded upon the FIRST reference to the name. The path (a string) would be attached to the node. When the name is referenced (Open("FOO:xyzzy"...), the string will be used to determine where to set the assign to, and if the directory can be locked, the assign will act from that point on as if it had been created by AssignLock() . A major advantage is assigning things to unmounted volumes, which will be requested upon access (useful in startup sequences). INPUTS name - Name of device to be assigned (without trailing ':') path - Name of late assignment to be resolved on the first reference. RESULT success - Success/failure indicator of the operation SEE ALSO Lock() , AssignAdd() , AssignPath() , AssignLock() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
