dos.library/Write ]" border=0> NAME Write -- Write bytes of data to a file SYNOPSIS returnedLength = Write( file, buffer, length ) D0 D1 D2 D3 LONG Write (BPTR, void *, LONG) FUNCTION Write() writes bytes of data to the opened file 'file'. 'length' indicates the length of data to be transferred; 'buffer' is a pointer to the buffer. The value returned is the length of information actually written. So, when 'length' is greater than zero, the value of 'length' is the number of characters written. Errors are indicated by a value of -1. Note: this is an unbuffered routine (the request is passed directly to the filesystem.) Buffered I/O is more efficient for small reads and writes; see FPutC() . INPUTS file - BCPL pointer to a file handle buffer - pointer to the buffer length - integer RESULTS returnedLength - integer SEE ALSO Read() , Seek() , Open() , Close() , FPutC [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
