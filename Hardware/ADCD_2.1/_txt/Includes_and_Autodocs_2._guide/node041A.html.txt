Add the necessary points to vector buffer. Closing a polygon may result in the generation of another AreaDraw() to close previous polygon. Remember to have an initialized AreaInfo structure attached to the RastPort . INPUTS rp - points to a RastPort structure x,y - positions in the raster RETURNS error - zero for success, or -1 if there is no space left in the vector list BUGS SEE ALSO InitArea() AreaDraw() AreaEllipse() AreaEnd() graphics/rastport.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
