diskfont.library/NewScaledDiskFont ]" border=0> NAME NewScaledDiskFont -- Create a DiskFont scaled from another. (V36) SYNOPSIS header = NewScaledDiskFont(srcFont, destTextAttr) D0 A0 A1 struct DiskFontHeader *NewScaledDiskFont( struct TextFont *, struct TTextAttr * ); INPUTS srcFont - the font from which the scaled font is to be constructed. destTextAttr - the desired attributes for the new scaled font. This may be a structure of type TextAttr or TTextAttr . RESULT header - a pointer to a DiskFontHeader structure. This is not being managed by the diskfont.library, however. NOTES o This function may use the blitter. o Fonts containing characters that render wholly outside the character advance cell are currently not scalable. o The font, and memory allocated for the scaled font can can be freed by calling StripFont() on the font, and then calling UnLoadSeg() on the segment created by this function. Both the TextFont structure, and segment pointer are contained within the DiskFontHeader struct. The DiskFontHeader structure will also be freed as part of the UnLoadSeg() call. StripFont() is a new graphics.library call as of V36. [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
