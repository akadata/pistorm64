This number will be a small integer and will come from the set of DRIVEXXX constants defined in . The only way you can actually use this command is if the trackdisk device understands the drive type of the hardware that is plugged in. This is because the OpenDevice() call will fail if the trackdisk device does not understand the drive type. To find raw drive identifiers see the disk.resource's DR_GETUNITID entry point. IO REQUEST INPUT io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command TD_GETDRIVETYPE io_Flags 0 or IOF_QUICK IO REQUEST RESULT io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in io_Actual - if io_Error is 0 this contains the drive type connected to this unit.
