SYNOPSIS cl = CINIT( ucl , n ) cl = UCopperListInit( ucl , n ) a0 d0 struct CopList *UCopperListInit( struct UCopList *, UWORD ); FUNCTION Allocates and/or initialize copperlist structures/buffers internal to a UCopList structure. This is a macro that calls UCopListInit. You must pass a (non-initialized) UCopList to CINIT (CINIT will NOT allocate a new UCopList if ucl==0 ). If (ucl != 0) it will initialize the intermediate data buffers internal to a UCopList . The maximum number of intermediate copper list instructions that these internal CopList data buffers contain is specified as the parameter n. INPUTS ucl - pointer to UCopList structure n - number of instructions buffer must be able to hold RESULTS cl- a pointer to a buffer which will accept n intermediate copper instructions. NOTE: this is NOT a UCopList pointer, rather a pointer to the UCopList's->FirstCopList sub-structure. BUGS CINIT will not actually allocate a new UCopList if ucl==0. Instead you must allocate a block MEMF_PUBLIC|MEMF_CLEAR, the sizeof(struct UCopList) and pass it to this function. The system's FreeVPortCopLists function will take care of deallocating it if they are called. Prior to release V36 the CINIT macro had { } braces surrounding the definition, preventing the proper return of the result value. These braces have been removed for the V36 include definitions.
