(V36) SYNOPSIS DrawImageState( RPort, Image , LeftOffset, TopOffset, State, DrawInfo ) A0 A1 D0 D1 D2 A2 VOID DrawImageState( struct RastPort *, struct Image *, WORD, WORD, ULONG, struct DrawInfo * ); FUNCTION This function draws an Intuition Image structure in a variety of "visual states," which are defined by constants in intuition/imageclass.h . These include: IDS_NORMAL - like DrawImage() IDS_SELECTED - represents the "selected state" of a Gadget IDS_DISABLED - the "ghosted state" of a gadget IDS_BUSY - for future functionality IDS_INDETERMINATE - for future functionality IDS_INACTIVENORMAL - for gadgets in window border IDS_INACTIVESELECTED - for gadgets in window border IDS_INACTIVEDISABLED - for gadgets in window border Only IDS_NORMAL will make sense for traditional Image structures, this function is more useful when applied to new custom images or "object-oriented image classes." Each class of custom images is responsible for documenting which visual states it supports, and you typically want to use images which support the appropriate states with your custom gadgets. The DrawInfo parameter provides information invaluable to "rendered" images, such as pen color and resolution. Each image class must document whether this parameter is required. INPUTS RPort - RastPort for rendering Image - pointer to a (preferably custom) image LeftOffset,RightOffset - positional offsets in pixels State - visual state selected from above DrawInfo - pointer to packed of pen selections and resolution. RESULT None. EXAMPLE Provided separately in the DevCon '90 disk set. NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO DrawImage() , GetScreenDrawInfo() , intuition/imageclass.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
