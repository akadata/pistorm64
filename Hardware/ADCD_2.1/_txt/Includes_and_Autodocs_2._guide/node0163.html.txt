amiga.lib/RangeRand ]" border=0> NAME RangeRand - generate a random number within a specific integer range SYNOPSIS number = RangeRand(maxValue); UWORD RangeRand(UWORD); FUNCTION RangeRand() accepts a value from 0 to 65535, and returns a value within that range. maxValue is passed on stack as a 32-bit integer but used as though it is only a 16-bit integer. Variable named RangeSeed is available beginning with V33 that contains the global seed value passed from call to call and thus can be changed in a program by declaring: extern ULONG RangeSeed; INPUTS maxValue - the returned random number will be in the range [0..maxValue-1] RESULT number - pseudo random number in the range of [0..maxValue-1].
