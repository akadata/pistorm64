(V36) SYNOPSIS success = QueryOverscan( DisplayID, Rect, OScanType ) D0 A0 A1 D0 LONG QueryOverscan( ULONG, struct Rectangle *, WORD ); FUNCTION This function fills in a rectangle with one of the system overscan dimensions, scaled appropriately for the mode of the DisplayID it is passed. There are three types of system overscan values: OSCAN_TEXT: completely visible, by user preference. Used for Workbench screen and screen dimensions STDSCREENWIDTH and STDSCREENHEIGHT. Left/Top is always 0,0. OSCAN_STANDARD: just beyond visible bounds of monitor, by user preference. Left/Top may be negative. OSCAN_MAX: The largest region we can display, AND display any smaller region (see note below). OSCAN_VIDEO: The absolute largest region that the graphics.library can display. This region must be used as-is. INPUTS DisplayID -- A 32-bit identifier for a display mode, as defined in graphics/displayinfo.h . NOTE: If you only intend to use one of the four standard overscan dimensions as is, and open your screen to exactly the DisplayClip dimensions, you can specify one of the OSCAN_ values in the ExtNewScreen tag SA_StdDClip, and specify STDSCREENWIDTH and STDSCREENHEIGHT as the dimensions to more easily open up an overscanned screen (or use no NewScreen in OpenScreenTagList() and accept the default standard screen dimensions). Rect -- pointer to a Rectangle structure which this function will fill out with its return values. Note that to convert a rectangle to a screen "Height" you do (MaxY - MinY + 1), and similarly for "Width." The rectangle may be passed directly to OpenScreen() as a DisplayClip region (SA_DClip). RESULT 0 (FALSE) if the MonitorSpec your NewScreen requests does not exist. Non-zero (TRUE) if it does. BUGS Change in parameter V36.A17 might cause problems for some.
