audio.device/ADCMD_SETPREC ]" border=0> NAME ADCMD_SETPREC -- set the allocation precedence for audio channels FUNCTION ADCMD_SETPREC is a command for multiple audio channels. For each selected channel (io_Unit), if the allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) is correct, ADCMD_SETPREC sets the allocation precedence to a new value (ln_Pri) and checks if there are allocation requests (ADCMD_ALLOCATE) waiting for the channel which now have higher precedence; otherwise, ADCMD_SETPREC returns an error (ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION). ADCMD_SETPREC is synchronous and only replies (mn_ReplyPort) if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear. Do not use ADCMD_SETPREC in interrupt code. INPUTS ln_Pri - new allocation precedence (-128 thru 127) mn_ReplyPort- pointer to message port that receives I/O request if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear io_Device - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function io_Unit - bit map of channels to set precedence (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Command - command number for ADCMD_SETPREC io_Flags - flags, must be cleared if not used: IOF_QUICK - (CLEAR) reply I/O request ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function or ADCMD_ALLOCATE command OUTPUTS io_Unit - bit map of channels that successfully set precedence (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Error - error number: 0 - no error ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION - allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) does not match key for channel [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
