commodities.library/SetTranslate ]" border=0> NAME SetTranslate -- replace a translator object's translation list. (V36) SYNOPSIS SetTranslate(translator,events); A0 A1 VOID SetTranslate(CxObj *,struct InputEvent *); FUNCTION This function replaces the translation list of a commodity translator object with the linked list starting at 'events'. A NULL value for 'events' indicates that the object 'translator' should swallow all commodity messages that are sent its way. Note that the input events are not copied into commodities' private memory, but the value of 'events' is used -- asynchronously to the application program -- to find a chain of InputEvents in the application's data space. At the time of translation, each input event is copied into its own new commodity message. The above means that no other commodities' user, nor commodities.library itself will be modifying your list of InputEvents. On the other hand, your program must not corrupt the input event chain that has been presented to a translator.
