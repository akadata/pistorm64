(V36) SYNOPSIS filterObj = Hotkey(description,port,id); CxObj *HotKey(STRPTR,struct MsgPort *,LONG); FUNCTION This function creates a triad of commodity objects to accomplish a high-level function. The three objects are a filter, which is created to match by the call CxFilter(description), a sender created by the call CxSender(port,id), and a translator which is created by CxTranslate(NULL), so that it swallows any commodity input event messages that are passed down by the filter. This is the simple way to get a message sent to your program when the user performs a particular input action. It is strongly recommended that the ToolTypes environment be used to allow the user to specify the input descriptions for your application's hotkeys. INPUTS description - the description string to use for the filter in the same format as accepted by commodities.library/SetFilter() port - port for the sender to send messages to. id - id of the messages sent by the sender RESULTS filterObj - a pointer to a filter object, or NULL if it could not be created.
