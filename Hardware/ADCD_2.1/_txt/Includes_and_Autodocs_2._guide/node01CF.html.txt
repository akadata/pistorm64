SYNOPSIS error = OpenIFF (iff, rwmode) d0 a0 d0 LONG error; struct IFFHandle *iff; LONG rwmode; FUNCTION Initializes an IFFHandle struct for a new read or write. The direction of the I/O is given by the value of rwmode, which can be either IFFF_READ or IFFF_WRITE. As part of its initialization procedure, OpenIFF() calls the client- supplied stream hook vector. The IFFStreamCmd packet will contain the following: sc_Command: IFFCMD_INIT sc_Buf: (Not applicable) sc_NBytes: (Not applicable) This operation is permitted to fail. DO NOT write to this structure. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct. rwmode - IFFF_READ or IFFF_WRITE RESULT error - contains an error code or 0 if successful.
