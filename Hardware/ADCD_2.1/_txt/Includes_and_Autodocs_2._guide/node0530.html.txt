trackdisk.device/TD_SEEK ]" border=0> NAME TD_SEEK/ETD_SEEK -- control positioning of the drive heads. FUNCTION These commands are currently provided for internal diagnostics, disk repair, and head cleaning only. TD_SEEK and ETD_SEEK move the drive heads to the track specified. The io_Offset field should be set to the (byte) offset to which the seek is to occur. TD_SEEK and ETD_SEEK do not verify their position until the next read. That is, they only move the heads; they do not actually read any data. IO REQUEST INPUT io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command TD_SEEK or ETD_SEEK io_Flags 0 or IOF_QUICK io_Offset byte offset from the start of the disk describing where to move the head to. iotd_Count (ETD_SEEK only) maximum allowable change counter value. IO REQUEST RESULT io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
