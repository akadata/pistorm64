SYNOPSIS actual = ReadChunkBytes (iff, buf, size) d0 a0 a1 d0 LONG actual; struct IFFHandle *iff; UBYTE *buf; LONG size; FUNCTION Reads the IFFHandle stream into the buffer for the specified number of bytes. Reads are limited to the size of the current chunk and attempts to read past the end of the chunk will truncate. Function returns positive number of bytes read or a negative error code. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct. buf - pointer to buffer area to receive data. size - number of bytes to read. RESULT actual - (positive) number of bytes read if successful or a (negative) IFFERR_#? error code if not successful.
