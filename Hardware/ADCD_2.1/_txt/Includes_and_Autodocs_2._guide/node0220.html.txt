intuition.library/GetScreenDrawInfo ]" border=0> NAME GetScreenDrawInfo -- Get pointer to rendering information. (V36) SYNOPSIS DrInfo = GetScreenDrawInfo( Screen ) D0 A0 struct DrawInfo *GetScreenDrawInfo( struct Screen * ); FUNCTION Returns a pointer to a DrawInfo structure derived from the screen passed. This data structure is READ ONLY. The field dri_Version identifies which version of struct DrawInfo you are given a pointer to. INPUTS Screen - pointer to a valid, open screen. RESULT DrInfo - pointer to a system-allocated DrawInfo structure, as defined in intuition/screens.h . NOTES Some information in the DrawInfo structure may in the future be calculated the first time this function is called for a particular screen. You must call FreeScreenDrawInfo() when you are done using the returned pointer. This function does not prevent a screen from closing. Apply it only to the screens you opened yourself, or apply a protocol such as LockPubScreen() . WARNING: Until further notice, the pointer returned does not remain valid after the screen is closed. This function and FreeScreenDrawInfo() don't really do much now, but they provide an upward compatibility path. That means that if you misuse them today, they probably won't cause a problem, although they may someday later. So, please be very careful only to use the DrawInfo structure between calls to GetScreenDrawInfo() and FreeScreenDrawInfo() , and be sure that you don't forget FreeScreenDrawInfo() . BUGS Does not reflect to changes in screen modes, depth, or pens. SEE ALSO FreeScreenDrawInfo() , LockPubScreen() , intuition/screens.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
