intuition.library/IntuiTextLength ]" border=0> NAME IntuiTextLength -- Return the length (pixel-width) of an IntuiText . SYNOPSIS Length = IntuiTextLength( IText ) D0 A0 LONG IntuiTextLength( struct IntuiText * ); FUNCTION This routine accepts a pointer to an instance of an IntuiText structure, and returns the length (the pixel-width) of the string which that instance of the structure represents. NOTE: if the Font pointer of your IntuiText structure is set to NULL, you'll get the pixel-width of your text in terms of the current system default font. You may wish to be sure that the field IText->ITextFont for 'default font' text is equal to the Font field of the screen it is being measured for. INPUTS IText = pointer to an instance of an IntuiText structure RESULT Returns the pixel-width of the text specified by the IntuiText data BUGS Would do better to take a RastPort as argument, so that a NULL in the Font pointer would lead automatically to the font for the intended target RastPort , rather than the system default font.
