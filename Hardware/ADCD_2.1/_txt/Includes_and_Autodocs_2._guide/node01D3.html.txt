iffparse.library/PropChunk ]" border=0> NAME PropChunk -- Specify a property chunk to store. SYNOPSIS error = PropChunk (iff, type, id) d0 a0 d0 d1 LONG error; struct IFFHandle *iff; LONG type; LONG id; FUNCTION Installs an entry handler for chunks with the given type and ID so that the contents of those chunks will be stored as they are encountered. The storage of these chunks follows the property chunk scoping rules for IFF files so that at any given point, a stored property chunk returned by FindProp() will be the valid property for the current context. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct (does not need to be open). type - type code for the chunk to declare (ex. "ILBM"). id - identifier for the chunk to declare (ex. "CMAP"). RESULT error - 0 if successful or an IFFERR_#? error code if not successful. EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO PropChunks() , FindProp() , CollectionChunk() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
