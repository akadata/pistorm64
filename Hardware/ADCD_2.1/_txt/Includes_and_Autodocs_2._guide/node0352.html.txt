TITLE: exec.library/FindTask

exec.library/FindTask ]" border=0> NAME FindTask -- find a task with the given name or find oneself SYNOPSIS task = FindTask(name) D0 A1 struct Task *FindTask(STRPTR); FUNCTION This function will check all task queues for a task with the given name, and return a pointer to its task control block. If a NULL name pointer is given a pointer to the current task will be returned. Finding oneself with a NULL for the name is very quick. Finding a task by name is very system expensive, and will disable interrupts for a long time. Since a task may remove itself at any time, a Forbid()/Permit() pair may be needed to ensure the pointer returned by FindTask() is still valid when used. INPUT name - pointer to a name string RESULT task - pointer to the task (or Process) [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
