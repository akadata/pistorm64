INPUTS type = type of requester to create. Currently defined types include ASL_FileRequest and ASL_FontRequest. ptags = pointer to a tagitem array, which is defined for each specified type. See "asl.h" and example programs for usage of various tag types. See AslRequest() for specifications of currently defined tag values and their effects. Note that tag values stay in effect for each use of the requester until they are cleared or modified by passing the same tag with a new value. AllocAslRequestTags( type, tags... ) which accepts your tags on the stack, is available in amiga.lib. Example Usage: AllocAslRequestTags( ASL_FileRequest, ASL_Hail, "My Title Bar", TAG_DONE ); RESULT Pointer to an initialized requester data structure, or NULL on failure. The data structure returned will match the requested type; for type ASL_FileRequest, a struct FileRequester *; for ASL_FontRequest, a struct FontRequester *. The requester returned may then be passed to AslRequest() , and is freed by calling FreeAslRequest() . SEE ALSO AslRequest() , FreeAslRequest() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
