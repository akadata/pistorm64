SYNOPSIS actual = ReadChunkRecords (iff, buf, recsize, numrec) d0 a0 a1 d0 d1 LONG actual; struct IFFHandle *iff; UBYTE *buf; LONG recsize, numrec; FUNCTION Reads records from the current chunk into buffer. Truncates attempts to read past end of chunk (only whole records are read; remaining bytes that are not of a whole record size are left unread and available for ReadChunkBytes() ). INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct. buf - pointer to buffer area to receive data. recsize - size of data records to read. numrec - number of data records to read. RESULT actual - (positive) number of whole records read if successful or a (negative) IFFERR_#? error code if not successful.
