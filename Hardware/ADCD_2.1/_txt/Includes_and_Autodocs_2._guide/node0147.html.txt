amiga.lib/CreateExtIO ]" border=0> NAME CreateExtIO -- create an IORequest structure SYNOPSIS ioReq = CreateExtIO(port,ioSize); struct IORequest *CreateExtIO(struct MsgPort *, ULONG); FUNCTION Allocates memory for and initializes a new IO request block of a user-specified number of bytes. The number of bytes MUST be the size of a legal IORequest (or extended IORequest) or very nasty things will happen. INPUTS port - an already initialized message port to be used for this IO request's reply port. If this is NULL this function fails. ioSize - the size of the IO request to be created. RESULT ioReq - a new IO Request block, or NULL if there was not enough memory EXAMPLE if (ioReq = CreateExtIO(CreatePort(NULL,0),sizeof(struct IOExtTD))) SEE ALSO DeleteExtIO() , CreatePort() , exec.library/CreateMsgPort() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
