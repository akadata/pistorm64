utility.library/ToLower ]" border=0> NAME ToLower - Convert a character to lowercase. (V37) SYNOPSIS char = ToLower(char) D0 D0 char ToLower(char); FUNCTION Converts a character to lowercase, handling international character sets. INPUTS char - character to be converted. RESULT char - lowercase version of input character. NOTES Commodore is planning a localization library which will take care of most details pertaining to system integration into different cultures, locales, and territories. This function will automatically be replaced by a localized version whenever the locale.library is loaded in memory. As such, the resulting converted character may change depending on the locale currently defined by the user. Take this fact into consideration when using this function, and do not rely on obtaining specific conversions. BUGS SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
