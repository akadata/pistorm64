graphics.library/Text ]" border=0> NAME Text -- Write text characters (no formatting). SYNOPSIS Text(rp, string, length) A1 A0 D0-0:16 void Text(struct RastPort *, STRPTR, WORD); FUNCTION This graphics function writes printable text characters to the specified RastPort at the current position. No control meaning is applied to any of the characters, thus only text on the current line is output. The current position in the RastPort is updated to the next character position. If the characters displayed run past the RastPort boundary, the current position is truncated to the boundary, and thus does not equal the old position plus the text length. INPUTS rp - a pointer to the RastPort which describes where the text is to be output string - the address of string to output length - the number of characters in the string. If zero, there are no characters to be output. NOTES o This function may use the blitter. o Changing the text direction with RastPort->TxSpacing is not supported. BUGS For V34 and earlier: o The maximum string length (in pixels) is limited to (1024 - 16 = 1008) pixels wide. o A text string whose last character(s) have a tf_CharLoc size component that extends to the right of the rightmost of the initial and final CP positions will be (inappropriately) clipped.
