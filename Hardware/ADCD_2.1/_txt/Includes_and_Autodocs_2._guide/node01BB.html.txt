iffparse.library/CloseIFF ]" border=0> NAME CloseIFF -- Close an IFF context. SYNOPSIS CloseIFF (iff) a0 struct IFFHandle *iff; FUNCTION Completes an IFF read or write operation by closing the IFF context established for this IFFHandle struct. The IFFHandle struct itself is left ready for re-use and a new context can be opened with OpenIFF() . This function can be used for cleanup if a read or write fails partway through. As part of its cleanup operation, CloseIFF() calls the client- supplied stream hook vector. The IFFStreamCmd packet will be set as follows: sc_Command: IFFCMD_CLEANUP sc_Buf: (Not applicable) sc_NBytes: (Not applicable) This operation is NOT permitted to fail; any error code returned will be ignored (best to return 0, though). DO NOT write to this structure. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct previously opened with OpenIFF() . RESULT EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO OpenIFF() , InitIFF() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
