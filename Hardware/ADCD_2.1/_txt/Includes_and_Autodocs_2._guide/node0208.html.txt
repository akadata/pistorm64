intuition.library/CloseWindow ]" border=0> NAME CloseWindow -- Close an Intuition window. SYNOPSIS CloseWindow( Window ) A0 VOID CloseWindow( struct Window * ); FUNCTION Closes an Intuition window. Unlinks it from the system, deallocates its memory, and makes it disappear. When this function is called, all IDCMP messages which have been sent to your window are deallocated. If the window had shared a message Port with other windows, you must be sure that there are no unreplied messages for this window in the message queue. Otherwise, your program will try to make use of a linked list (the queue) which contains free memory (the old messages). This will give you big problems. See the code fragment CloseWindowSafely(), below. NOTE: If you have added a Menu strip to this Window (via a call to SetMenuStrip() ) you must be sure to remove that Menu strip (via a call to ClearMenuStrip() ) before closing your Window . NOTE: This function may block until it is safe to de-link and free your window. Your program may thus be suspended while the user plays with gadgets, menus, or window sizes and position. New for V36: If your window is a "Visitor Window" (see OpenWindow) CloseWindow will decrement the "visitor count" in the public screen on which the window was open. When the last visitor window is closed, a signal will be sent to the public screen task, if this was pre-arranged (see OpenScreen). INPUTS Window = a pointer to a Window structure RESULT None BUGS SEE ALSO OpenWindow() , OpenScreen() , CloseScreen() EXAMPLE /* CloseWindowSafely */ /* these functions close an Intuition window * that shares a port with other Intuition * windows or IPC customers. * * We are careful to set the UserPort to * null before closing, and to free * any messages that it might have been * sent. */ #include "exec/types.h" #include "exec/nodes.h" #include "exec/lists.h" #include "exec/ports.h" #include "intuition/intuition.h" CloseWindowSafely( win ) struct Window *win; { /* we forbid here to keep out of race conditions with Intuition */ Forbid(); /* send back any messages for this window * that have not yet been processed */ StripIntuiMessages( win->UserPort, win ); /* clear UserPort so Intuition will not free it */ win->UserPort = NULL; /* tell Intuition to stop sending more messages */ ModifyIDCMP( win, 0L ); /* turn multitasking back on */ Permit(); /* and really close the window */ CloseWindow( win ); } /* remove and reply all IntuiMessages on a port that * have been sent to a particular window * (note that we don't rely on the ln_Succ pointer * of a message after we have replied it) */ StripIntuiMessages( mp, win ) struct MsgPort *mp; struct Window *win; { struct IntuiMessage *msg; struct Node *succ; msg = (struct IntuiMessage *) mp->mp_MsgList.lh_Head; while( succ = msg->ExecMessage.mn_Node.ln_Succ ) { if( msg->IDCMPWindow == win ) { /* Intuition is about to free this message. * Make sure that we have politely sent it back. */ Remove( msg ); ReplyMsg( msg ); } msg = (struct IntuiMessage *) succ; } } [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
