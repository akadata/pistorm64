TITLE: expansion.library/AddDosNode

expansion.library/AddDosNode ]" border=0> NAME AddDosNode -- mount a disk to the system SYNOPSIS ok = AddDosNode( bootPri, flags, deviceNode ) D0 D0 D1 A0 BOOL AddDosNode( BYTE,ULONG,struct DeviceNode *); FUNCTION This is the old (pre V36) function that works just like AddBootNode() . It should only be used if you *MUST* work in a 1.3 system and you don't need to autoboot. RESULTS ok - non-zero everything went ok, zero if we ran out of memory or some other weirdness happened. EXAMPLE /* enter a bootable disk into the system. Start a file handler ** process immediately. */ if( AddDosNode( 0, ADNF_STARTPROC, MakeDosNode( paramPacket ) ) ) ...AddDosNode ok... BUGS Before V36 Kickstart, no function existed to add BOOTNODES. If an older expansion.library is in use, driver code will need to manually construct a BootNode and Enqueue() it to eb_Mountlist. If you have a V36 or better expansion.library, your code should use AddBootNode() . SEE ALSO MakeDosNode , AddBootNode [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
