exec.library/DoIO ]" border=0> NAME DoIO -- perform an I/O command and wait for completion SYNOPSIS error = DoIO(iORequest) D0 A1 BYTE DoIO(struct IORequest *); FUNCTION This function requests a device driver to perform the I/O command specified in the I/O request. This function will always wait until the I/O request is fully complete. DoIO() handles all the details, including Quick I/O, waiting for the request, and removing the reply message, etc.. IMPLEMENTATION This function first tries to complete the IO via the "Quick I/O" mechanism. The io_Flags field is always set to IOF_QUICK (0x01) before the internal device call. The LN_TYPE field is used internally to flag completion. Active requests have type NT_MESSAGE. Requests that have been replied have type NT_REPLYMSG. It is illegal to start IO using a still active IORequest , or a request with type NT_REPLYMSG. INPUTS iORequest - pointer to an IORequest initialized by OpenDevice() RESULTS error - a sign-extended copy of the io_Error field of the IORequest . Most device commands require that the error return be checked. SEE ALSO SendIO , CheckIO , WaitIO , AbortIO , amiga.lib/BeginIO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
