expansion.library/GetCurrentBinding ]" border=0> NAME GetCurrentBinding - sets static board configuration area SYNOPSIS actual = GetCurrentBinding( currentBinding, size ) A0 D0:16 FUNCTION This function writes the contents of the "currentBinding" structure out of a private place. It may be set via SetCurrentBinding() . This is really a kludge, but it is the only way to pass extra arguments to a newly configured device. A CurrentBinding structure has the name of the currently loaded file, the product string that was associated with this driver, and a pointer to the head of a singly linked list of ConfigDev structures (linked through the cd_NextCD field). Many devices may not need this information; they have hard coded into themselves their manufacture number. It is recommended that you at least check that you can deal with the product code in the linked ConfigDev structures. INPUTS currentBinding - a pointer to a CurrentBinding structure size - The size of the user's binddriver structure. Do not pass in less than sizeof(struct CurrentBinding). RESULTS actual - the true size of a CurrentBinding structure is returned. SEE ALSO GetCurrentBinding [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
