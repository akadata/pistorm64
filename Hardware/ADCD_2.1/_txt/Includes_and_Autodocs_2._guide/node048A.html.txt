SYNOPSIS WaitBOVP( vp ) a0 void WaitBOVP( struct ViewPort * ); FUNCTION Returns when the vertical beam has reached the bottom of this viewport INPUTS vp - pointer to ViewPort structure RESULT This function will return sometime after the beam gets beyond the bottom of the viewport. Depending on the multitasking load of the system, the actual beam position may be different than what would be expected in a lightly loaded system. BUGS Horrors!
