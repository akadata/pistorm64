graphics.library/GetColorMap ]" border=0> NAME GetColorMap -- allocate and initialize Colormap SYNOPSIS cm = GetColorMap( entries ) d0 d0 struct ColorMap *GetColorMap( ULONG); FUNCTION Allocates, initializes and returns a pointer to a ColorMap data structure, later enabling calls to SetRGB4 and LoadRGB4 to load colors for a view port. The ColorTable pointer in the ColorMap structure points to a hardware specific colormap data structure. You should not count on it being anything you can understand. Use GetRGB4() to query it or SetRGB4CM to set it directly. INPUTS entries - number of entries for this colormap RESULT The pointer value returned by this routine, if nonzero, may be stored into the ViewPort.ColorMap pointer. If a value of 0 is returned, the system was unable to allocate enough memory space for the required data structures. BUGS SEE ALSO SetRGB4() FreeColorMap() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
