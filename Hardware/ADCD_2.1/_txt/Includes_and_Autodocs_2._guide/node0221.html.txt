TITLE: intuition.library/InitRequester

intuition.library/InitRequester ]" border=0> NAME InitRequester -- Initialize a Requester structure. SYNOPSIS InitRequester( Requester ) A0 VOID InitRequester( struct Requester * ); FUNCTION Initializes a requester for general use. After calling InitRequester, you need fill in only those Requester values that fit your needs. The other values are set to NULL--or zero--states. Note that the example in the early versions of the Intuition Reference Manual is flawed because the Requester structure is initialized BEFORE InitRequester is called. Be sure to perform your initialization AFTER calling InitRequester. INPUTS Requester = a pointer to a Requester structure RESULT None BUGS Since the publication of the first Intuition Manual to this day, most people haven't used this function, and for compatibility reasons, we'll never be able to assume that they do. Thus, this function is useless. SEE ALSO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
