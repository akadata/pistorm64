iffparse.library/PushChunk ]" border=0> NAME PushChunk -- Push a new context node on the context stack. SYNOPSIS error = PushChunk (iff, type, id, size) d0 a0 d0 d1 d2 LONG error; struct IFFHandle *iff; LONG type, id, size; FUNCTION Pushes a new context node on the context stack by reading it from the stream if this is a read file, or by creating it from the passed parameters if this is a write file. Normally this function is only called in write mode, where the type and id codes specify the new chunk to create. If this is a leaf chunk, i.e. a local chunk inside a FORM or PROP chunk, then the type argument is ignored. If the size is specified then the chunk writing functions will enforce this size. If the size is given as IFFSIZE_UNKNOWN, the chunk will expand to accommodate whatever is written into it. INPUTS iff - pointer to IFFHandle struct. type - chunk type specifier (ex. ILBM) (ignored for read mode or leaf chunks). id - chunk id specifier (ex. CMAP) (ignored for read mode). size - size of the chunk to create or IFFSIZE_UNKNOWN (ignored for read mode). RESULT error - 0 if successful or an IFFERR_#? error code if not successful. EXAMPLE NOTES BUGS SEE ALSO PopChunk() , WriteChunkRecords() , WriteChunkBytes() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
