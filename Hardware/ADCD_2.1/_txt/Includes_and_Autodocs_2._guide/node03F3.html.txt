gadtools.library/GT_PostFilterIMsg ]" border=0> NAME GT_PostFilterIMsg -- Return the unfiltered message after GT_FilterIMsg() was called, and clean up. (V36) SYNOPSIS imsg = GT_PostFilterIMsg(modimsg) D0 A1 struct IntuiMessage *GT_PostFilterIMsg(struct IntuiMessage *); FUNCTION NOTE WELL: Extremely few programs will actually need this function. You almost certainly should be using GT_GetIMsg() and GT_ReplyIMsg() only, and not GT_FilterIMsg() and GT_PostFilterIMsg(). Performs any clean-up necessitated by a previous call to GT_FilterIMsg() . The original IntuiMessage is now yours to handle. Do not interpret the fields of the original IntuiMessage , but rather use only the one you got from GT_FilterIMsg() . You may only do message related things at this point, such as queueing it up or replying it. Since you got the message with exec.library/GetMsg() , your responsibilities do include replying it with exec.library/ReplyMsg() . This function may be safely called with a NULL parameter. INPUTS modimsg - A modified IntuiMessage obtained with GT_FilterIMsg() . RESULT imsg - A pointer to the original IntuiMessage , if GT_FilterIMsg() returned non-NULL. EXAMPLE NOTES Be sure to use exec.library/ReplyMsg() on the original IntuiMessage you obtained with GetMsg() , (which is the what you passed to GT_FilterIMsg() ), and not on the parameter of this function.
