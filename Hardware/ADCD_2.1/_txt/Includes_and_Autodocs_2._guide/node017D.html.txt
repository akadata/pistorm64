asl.library/AllocFileRequest ]" border=0> NAME AllocFileRequest -- allocates a FileRequester structure (V36) SYNOPSIS request = AllocFileRequest() D0 struct FileRequester *request; FUNCTION Creates and initializes the data structure required to pass to the RequestFile() function. INPUTS None. If you wish to get other than default values, you can use AllocAslRequest() to set up a file request with tag items. RESULT Pointer to a struct FileRequester , which is to be passed to the RequestFile() function. The returned FileRequester pointer has public fields which are readable by the application as defined in aslbase.h. CAUTION The application MUST use either the AllocFileRequest(), or AllocAslRequest() , function to allocate the structure to be passed to the FileRequest() or AslRequest() functions; it is not possible to create a struct FileRequest except through the library calls. Also, any modifications MUST be done through TagItem values, rather than directly modifying, unless explicitly documented otherwise.
