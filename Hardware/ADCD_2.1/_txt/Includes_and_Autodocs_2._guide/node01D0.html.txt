iffparse.library/ParentChunk ]" border=0> NAME ParentChunk -- Get the nesting context node for the given chunk. SYNOPSIS parent = ParentChunk (cn) d0 a0 struct ContextNode *parent, *cn; FUNCTION Returns a context node for the chunk containing the chunk for the given context node. This function effectively moves down the context stack into previously pushed contexts. For example, to get a ContextNode pointer for the enclosing FORM chunk while reading a data chunk, use: ParentChunk (CurrentChunk (iff)) to find this pointer. The ContextNode structure contains information on the type of chunk and its size. INPUTS cn - pointer to a context node. RESULT parent - pointer to the enclosing context node or NULL if none.
