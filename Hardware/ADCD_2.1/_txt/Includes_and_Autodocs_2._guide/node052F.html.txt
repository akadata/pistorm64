trackdisk.device/TD_REMCHANGEINT ]" border=0> NAME TD_REMCHANGEINT -- remove a disk change software interrupt handler. FUNCTION This command removes a disk change software interrupt added by a previous use of TD_ADDCHANGEINT . IO REQUEST INPUT The same IO request used for TD_ADDCHANGEINT . io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command TD_REMCHANGEINT io_Flags 0 io_Length sizeof(struct Interrupt) io_Data pointer to Interrupt structure IO REQUEST RESULT io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in BUGS This command did not function properly under versions of Kickstart earlier than V36. A valid workaround under these older versions of Kickstart is: Forbid(); Remove(ioRequest); Permit(); Do not use this workaround in versions of Kickstart >= V36, use TD_REMCHANGEINT instead (for future compatibility with V38+).
