commodities.library/InvertKeyMap ]" border=0> NAME InvertKeyMap -- generate an input event from an ANSI code. (V36) SYNOPSIS success = InvertKeyMap(ansicode,event,km) D0 A0 A1 BOOL InvertKeyMap(ULONG,struct InputEvent *,struct KeyMap *); FUNCTION This function uses the system call MapANSI() to figure out what InputEvent translates to an ANSI character code 'ansicode'. The InputEvent pointed to by 'event' is filled in with that information. The KeyMap 'km' is used for the translation, unless it is NULL, in which case the system default keymap (as defined when commodities.library is initialized) is used. INPUTS ansicode - the ANSI code to convert to an input event event - the InputEvent to fill-in km - the keymap to use for the translation, or NULL to use the system default keymap. RESULTS success - TRUE if the translation worked, FALSE otherwise. BUGS This function currently handles one-deep dead keys (such as o). It does not look up the high key map (keystrokes with scan codes greater than 0x40), and misses system changes to the default key map. SEE ALSO cx_lib/InvertString() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
