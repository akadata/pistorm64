graphics.library/SetSoftStyle ]" border=0> NAME SetSoftStyle -- Set the soft style of the current font. SYNOPSIS newStyle = SetSoftStyle(rp, style, enable) D0 A1 D0 D1 ULONG SetSoftStyle(struct RastPort *, ULONG, ULONG); FUNCTION This function alters the soft style of the current font. Only those bits that are also set in enable are affected. The resulting style is returned, since some style request changes will not be honored when the implicit style of the font precludes changing them. INPUTS rp - the RastPort from which the font and style are extracted. style - the new font style to set, subject to enable. enable - those bits in style to be changed. Any set bits here that would not be set as a result of AskSoftStyle will be ignored, and the newStyle result will not be as expected. RESULTS newStyle - the resulting style, both as a result of previous soft style selection, the effect of this function, and the style inherent in the set font.
