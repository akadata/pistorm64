TAG_END ); FUNCTION Attempt to add the text as a menuitem to workbench's list of appmenuitems (the 'Tools' menu strip). INPUTS id - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by workbench.

Must be NULL for V2.0. RESULTS AppMenuItem - a pointer to an appmenuitem structure which you pass to RemoveAppMenuItem when you want to remove the menuitem from workbench's list of appmenuitems.
