narrator.device/CMD_RESET ]" border=0> NAME CMD_RESET - Reset the device to a known state SYNOPSIS Standard device command. FUNCTION Resets the device as though it has just be initialized. Aborts all read/write requests whether active of enqueued. Restarts device if it has been stopped. INPUTS Valid IORequest block with the io_Command field set to CMD_RESET. A valid IORequest block is one with its io_Message structure, and io_Device and io_Unit fields properly initialized. The easiest way to insure proper initialization is to make a copy of the IORequest block after a successful OpenDevice call. RESULTS SEE ALSO Exec input/output documentation.
