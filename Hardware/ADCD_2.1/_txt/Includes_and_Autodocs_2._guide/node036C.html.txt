exec.library/RawDoFmt ]" border=0> NAME RawDoFmt -- format data into a character stream. SYNOPSIS NextData = RawDoFmt(FormatString, DataStream, PutChProc, PutChData); d0 a0 a1 a2 a3 APTR RawDoFmt(STRPTR,APTR,void (*)(),APTR); FUNCTION perform "C"-language-like formatting of a data stream, outputting the result a character at a time. Where % formatting commands are found in the FormatString, they will be replaced with the corresponding element in the DataStream. %% must be used in the string if a % is desired in the output. Under V36, RawDoFmt() returns a pointer to the end of the DataStream (The next argument that would have been processed). This allows multiple formatting passes to be made using the same data. INPUTS FormatString - a "C"-language-like NULL terminated format string, with the following supported % options: %[flags][width.limit][length]type flags - only one allowed. '-' specifies left justification. width - field width. If the first character is a '0', the field will be padded with leading 0's. . - must follow the field width, if specified limit - maximum number of characters to output from a string. (only valid for %s). length - size of input data defaults to WORD for types d, x, and c, 'l' changes this to long (32-bit). type - supported types are: b - BSTR, data is 32-bit BPTR to byte count followed by a byte string, or NULL terminated byte string. A NULL BPTR is treated as an empty string. (Added in V36 exec) d - decimal u - unsigned decimal (Added in V37 exec) x - hexadecimal s - string, a 32-bit pointer to a NULL terminated byte string. In V36, a NULL pointer is treated as an empty string c - character DataStream - a stream of data that is interpreted according to the format string. Often this is a pointer into the task's stack. PutChProc - the procedure to call with each character to be output, called as: PutChProc(Char, PutChData); D0-0:8 A3 the procedure is called with a NULL Char at the end of the format string. PutChData - a value that is passed through to the PutChProc procedure. This is untouched by RawDoFmt, and may be modified by the PutChProc. EXAMPLE ; ; Simple version of the C "sprintf" function. Assumes C-style ; stack-based function conventions. ; ; long eyecount; ; eyecount=2; ; sprintf(string,"%s have %ld eyes.","Fish",eyecount); ; ; would produce "Fish have 2 eyes." in the string buffer. ; XDEF _sprintf XREF _AbsExecBase XREF _LVORawDoFmt _sprintf: ; ( ostring, format, {values} ) movem.l a2/a3/a6,-(sp) move.l 4*4(sp),a3 ;Get the output string pointer move.l 5*4(sp),a0 ;Get the FormatString pointer lea.l 6*4(sp),a1 ;Get the pointer to the DataStream lea.l stuffChar(pc),a2 move.l _AbsExecBase,a6 jsr _LVORawDoFmt(a6) movem.l (sp)+,a2/a3/a6 rts ;------ PutChProc function used by RawDoFmt ----------- stuffChar: move.b d0,(a3)+ ;Put data to output string rts WARNING This Amiga ROM function formats word values in the data stream. If your compiler defaults to longs, you must add an "l" to your % specifications. This can get strange for characters, which might look like "%lc". The result of RawDoFmt() is *ONLY* valid in V36 and later releases of EXEC. Pre-V36 versions of EXEC have "random" return values.
