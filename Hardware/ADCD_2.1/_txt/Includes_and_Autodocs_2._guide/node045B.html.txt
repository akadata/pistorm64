SYNOPSIS MakeVPort( view, viewport ) a0 a1 void MakeVPort( struct View *, struct ViewPort * ); FUNCTION Uses information in the View , ViewPort , ViewPort->RasInfo to construct and intermediate copper list for this ViewPort . INPUTS view - pointer to a View structure viewport - pointer to a ViewPort structure The viewport must have valid pointer to a RasInfo. RESULTS constructs intermediate copper list and puts pointers in viewport.DspIns If the ColorMap ptr in ViewPort is NULL then it uses colors from the default color table. If DUALPF in Modes then there must be a second RasInfo pointed to by the first RasInfo BUGS Narrow Viewports (whose righthand edge is less than 3/4 of the way across the display) still do not work properly.
