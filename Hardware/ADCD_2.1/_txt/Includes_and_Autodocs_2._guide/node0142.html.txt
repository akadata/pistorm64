amiga.lib/CallHook ]" border=0> NAME CallHook -- Invoke a hook given a message on the stack. (V36) SYNOPSIS result = CallHook( hookPtr, obj, ... ) ULONG CallHook( struct Hook *, Object *, ... ); FUNCTION Like CallHookA() , CallHook() invoke a hook on the supplied hook-specific data (an "object") and a parameter packet ("message"). However, CallHook() allows you to build the message on your stack. INPUTS hookPtr - A system-standard hook obj - hook-specific data object ... - The hook-specific message you wish to send. The hook is expecting a pointer to the message, so a pointer into your stack will be sent. RESULT result - a hook-specific result. NOTES While this function requires V36 or higher intuition.library, it first appeared in V37 amiga.lib. EXAMPLE If your hook's message was struct myMessage { ULONG mm_FirstGuy; ULONG mm_SecondGuy; ULONG mm_ThirdGuy; }; You could write: result = CallHook( hook, obj, firstguy, secondguy, thirdguy ); as a shorthand for: struct myMessage msg; msg.mm_FirstGuy = firstguy; msg.mm_SecondGuy = secondguy; msg.mm_ThirdGuy = thirdguy; result = CallHookA( hook, obj, &msg ); SEE ALSO CallHookA() , utility.library/CallHookPkt() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
