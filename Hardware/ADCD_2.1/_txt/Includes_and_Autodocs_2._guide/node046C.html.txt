graphics.library/ReadPixelLine8 ]" border=0> NAME ReadPixelLine8 -- read the pen number value of a horizontal line of pixels starting at a specified x,y location and continuing right for count pixels. (V36) SYNOPSIS count = ReadPixelLine8(rp,xstart,ystart,width,array,temprp) D0 A0 D0:16 D1:16 D2 A2 A1 LONG ReadPixelLine8(struct RastPort *, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD, UBYTE *, struct RastPort * ); FUNCTION For each pixel in a rectangular region, combine the bits from each of the bit-planes used to describe a particular RastPort into the pen number selector which that bit combination normally forms for the system hardware selection of pixel color. INPUTS rp - pointer to a RastPort structure (x,y) - a point in the RastPort width - count of horizontal pixels to read array - pointer to an array of UBYTEs from which to fetch the pixel data allocate at least (((width+15)>>4) Layer set == NULL, temporary memory allocated for temprp->BitMap with Rows set == 1, temprp->BytesPerRow == (((width+15)>>4) BitMap->Planes[]) RESULT For each pixel in the array: Pen - (0..255) number at that position is returned count - the number of pixels read. NOTE width must be non negative BUGS SEE ALSO ReadPixel() graphics/rastport.h [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
