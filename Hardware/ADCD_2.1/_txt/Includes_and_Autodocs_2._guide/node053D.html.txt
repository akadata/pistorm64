potgo.resource/AllocPotBits ]" border=0> NAME AllocPotBits -- Allocate bits in the potgo register. SYNOPSIS allocated = AllocPotBits(bits) D0 D0 UWORD AllocPotBits( UWORD ); FUNCTION The AllocPotBits routine allocates bits in the hardware potgo register that the application wishes to manipulate via WritePotgo . The request may be for more than one bit. A user trying to allocate bits may find that they are unavailable because they are already allocated, or because the start bit itself (bit 0) has been allocated, or if requesting the start bit, because input bits have been allocated. A user can block itself from allocation: i.e. it should FreePotgoBits the bits it has and re-AllocPotBits if it is trying to change an allocation involving the start bit. INPUTS bits - a description of the hardware bits that the application wishes to manipulate, loosely based on the register description itself: START (bit 0) - set if you wish to use start (i.e. start the proportional controller counters) with the input ports you allocate (below). You must allocate all the DATxx ports you want to apply START to in this same call, with the OUTxx bit clear. DATLX (bit 8) - set if you wish to use the port associated with the left (0) controller, pin 5. OUTLX (bit 9) - set if you promise to use the LX port in output mode only. The port is not set to output for you at this time -- this bit set indicates that you don't mind if STARTs are initiated at any time by others, since ports that are enabled for output are unaffected by START. DATLY (bit 10) - as DATLX but for the left (0) controller, pin 9. OUTLY (bit 11) - as OUTLX but for LY. DATRX (bit 12) - the right (1) controller, pin 5. OUTRX (bit 13) - OUT for RX. DATRY (bit 14) - the right (1) controller, pin 9. OUTRY (bit 15) - OUT for RY. RESULTS allocated - the START and DATxx bits of those requested that were granted. The OUTxx bits are don't cares.
