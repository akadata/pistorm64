amiga.lib/TimeDelay ]" border=0> NAME TimeDelay -- Return after a period of time has elapsed. SYNOPSIS Error = TimeDelay( Unit , Seconds, MicroSeconds ) D0 D0 D1 D2 LONG TimeDelay( LONG, ULONG, ULONG ); FUNCTION Waits for the period of time specified before returning to the the caller. INPUTS Unit -- timer.device unit to open for this command. Seconds -- The seconds field of a timerequest is filled with this value. Check the documentation for what a partucular timer.device unit expects there. MicroSeconds -- The microseconds field of a timerequest is filled with this value. Check the documentation for what a particular timer.device units expects there. RESULTS Error -- will be zero if all went well; otherwise, non-zero. NOTES Two likely reasons for failures are invalid unit numbers or no more free signal bits for this task. While this function first appears in V37 amiga.lib, it works on Kickstart V33 and higher.
