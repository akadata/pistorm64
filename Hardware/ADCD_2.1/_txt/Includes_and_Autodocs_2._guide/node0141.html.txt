amiga.lib/BeginIO ]" border=0> NAME BeginIO -- initiate asynchronous device I/O SYNOPSIS BeginIO(ioReq) VOID BeginIO(struct IORequest *); FUNCTION This function takes an IORequest , and passes it directly to the "BeginIO" vector of the proper device. This is equivalent to SendIO() , except that io_Flags is not cleared. A good understanding of Exec device I/O is required to properly use this function. This function does not wait for the I/O to complete. INPUTS ioReq - an initialized and opened IORequest structure with the io_Flags field set to a reasonable value (set to 0 if you do not require io_Flags).
