audio.device/CMD_STOP ]" border=0> NAME CMD_STOP -- stop device processing (like ^S) FUNCTION CMD_STOP is a standard command for multiple audio channels. For each selected channel (io_Unit), if the allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) is correct, CMD_STOP immediately stops any writes (CMD_WRITE) in progress; otherwise, CMD_STOP returns an error (ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION). CMD_WRITE queues up writes to a stopped channel until CMD_START starts the channel or CMD_RESET resets the channel. CMD_STOP is synchronous and only replies (mn_ReplyPort) if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear. Do not use CMD_STOP in interrupt code at interrupt level 5 or higher. INPUTS mn_ReplyPort- pointer to message port that receives I/O request after if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear io_Device - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function io_Unit - bit map of channels to stop (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Command - command number for CMD_STOP io_Flags - flags, must be cleared if not used: IOF_QUICK - (CLEAR) reply I/O request ioa_AllocKey- allocation key, must be set by (or copied from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function or ADCMD_ALLOCATE command OUTPUTS io_Unit - bit map of channels successfully stopped (bits 0 thru 3 correspond to channels 0 thru 3) io_Error - error number: 0 - no error ADIOERR_NOALLOCATION - allocation key (ioa_AllocKey) does not match key for channel [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
