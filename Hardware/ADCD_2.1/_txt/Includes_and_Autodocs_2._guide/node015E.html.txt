amiga.lib/HookEntry ]" border=0> NAME HookEntry -- Assembler to HLL conversion stub for hook entry. (V36) SYNOPSIS result = HookEntry( struct Hook *, Object *, APTR ) D0 A0 A2 A1 FUNCTION By definition, a standard hook entry-point must receive the hook in A0, the object in A2, and the message in A1. If your hook entry-point is written in a high-level language and is expecting its parameters on the stack, then HookEntry() will put the three parameters on the stack and invoke the function stored in the hook h_SubEntry field. This function is only useful to hook implementers, and is never called from C. INPUTS hook - pointer to hook being invoked object - pointer to hook-specific data msg - pointer to hook-specific message RESULT result - a hook-specific result. NOTES While this function requires V36 or higher intuition.library, it first appeared in V37 amiga.lib. EXAMPLE If your hook dispatcher is this: dispatch( struct Hook *hookPtr, Object *obj, APTR msg ) { ... } Then when you initialize your hook, you would say: myhook.h_Entry = HookEntry; /* amiga.lib stub */ myhook.h_SubEntry = dispatch; /* HLL entry */ SEE ALSO CallHook() , CallHookA() , [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
