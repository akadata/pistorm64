commodities.library/EnqueueCxObj ]" border=0> NAME EnqueueCxObj -- insert a commodity object within a list of objects based on object priority. (V36) SYNOPSIS EnqueueCxObj(headObj,co); A0 A1 VOID EnqueueCxObj(CxObj *,CxObj *); FUNCTION This function puts object 'co' into the list of object 'headObj'. The insertion point is determined by the object's priority. The objects are kept in the list from the highest priority to the lowest. New nodes are inserted in front of the first node with a lower priority. Hence a FIFO queue for nodes of equal priority. The priority of the commodity object can be set using SetCxObjPri() . INPUTS headObj - pointer to a list of objects co - the object to add to the list RESULTS If 'co' is NULL, this function will record that fact in the internal accumulated error of 'headObj'. This error record can be retrieved using CxObjError() and cleared using ClearCxObjError() . SEE ALSO SetCxObjPri() , CxObjError() , ClearCxObjError() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
