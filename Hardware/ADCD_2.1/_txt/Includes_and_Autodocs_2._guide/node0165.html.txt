amiga.lib/SetRexxVar ]" border=0> NAME SetRexxVar - Sets the value of a variable of a running ARexx program SYNOPSIS error = SetRexxVar(message,varname,value,length) D0 A0 A1 D0 D1 LONG SetRexxVar(struct RexxMsg *,char *,char *,ULONG); FUNCTION This function will attempt to the the value of the symbol varname in the ARexx script that sent the message. While this function is new in the V37 amiga.lib, it is safe to call it in all versions of the operating system. It is also PURE code, thus usable in resident/pure executables. NOTE This is a stub in amiga.lib. It is only available via amiga.lib. The stub has two labels. One, _SetRexxVar, takes the arguments from the stack. The other, SetRexxVar, takes the arguments in registers. This routine does a CheckRexxMsg() on the message. EXAMPLE char *value; /* Message is one from ARexx */ if (!SetRexxVar(rxmsg,"TheVar","25 Dollars",10)) { /* The value of TheVar will now be "25 Dollars" */ } INPUTS message A message gotten from an ARexx script varname The name of the variable to set value A string that will be the new value of the variable length The length of the value string RESULTS error 0 for success, otherwise an error code. (Other codes may exists, these are documented) 3 == Insufficient Storage 9 == String too long 10 == invalid message SEE ALSO SetRexxVar(), CheckRexxMsg() [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
