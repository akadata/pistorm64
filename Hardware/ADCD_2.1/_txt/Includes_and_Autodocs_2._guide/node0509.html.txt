console.device/OpenDevice ]" border=0> NAME OpenDevice -- a request to open a Console device SYNOPSIS error = OpenDevice("console.device", unit, IOStdReq , flags ) d0 a0 d0 a1 d1 FUNCTION The open routine grants access to a device. There are two fields in the IOStdReq block that will be filled in: the io_Device field and possibly the io_Unit field. As of (V37) the flags field may also be filled in with a value described below (see conunit.h or conunit.i). This open command differs from most other device open commands in that it requires some information to be supplied in the io_Data field of the IOStdReq block. This initialization information supplies the window that is used by the console device for output. The unit number that is a standard parameter for an open call is used specially by this device. See conunit.h, or conunit.i for defined valid unit numbers. unit number: -1 (CONU_LIBRARY) Used to get a pointer to the device library vector which is returned in the io_Device field of the IOStdReq block. No actual console is opened. You must still close the device when you are done with it. unit number: 0 (CONU_STANDARD) A unit number of zero binds the supplied window to a unique console. Sharing a console must be done at a level higher than the device. unit number: 1 (CONU_CHARMAP) (V36) A unit number of one is similar to a unit number of zero, but a console map is also created, and maintained by the console.device. The character map is used by the console device to restore obscured portions of windows which are revealed, and to redraw a window after a resize. Character mapped console.device windows must be opened as SIMPLE REFRESH windows. The character map is currently for internal use only, and is not accessible by the programmer. The character map stores characters, attributes, and style information for each character written with the CMD_WRITE command. unit number: 3 (CONU_SNIPMAP) (V36) A unit number of three is similar to a unit number of one, but also gives the user the ability to highlight text with the mouse which can be copied by pressing RIGHT AMIGA C. See NOTES below. flags: 0 (CONFLAG_DEFAULT) The flags field should be set to 0 under V34, or less. flags: 1 (CONFLAG_NODRAW_ON_NEWSIZE) (V37) The flags field can be set to 0, or 1 as of V37. The flags field is ignored under V36, so can be set, though it will have no effect. When set to 1, it means that you don't want the console.device to redraw the window when the window size is changed (assuming you have opened the console.device with a character map - unit numbers 1, or 3). This flag is ignored if you have opened a console.device with a unit number of 0. Typically you would use this flag when you want to perform your own window refresh on a newsize, and you want the benefits of a character mapped console. IO REQUEST io_Data struct Window *window This is the window that will be used for this console. It must be supplied if the unit in the OpenDevice call is 0 (see above). The RPort of this window is potentially in use by the console whenever there is an outstanding write command. INPUTS "console.device" - a pointer to the name of the device to be opened. unit - the unit number to open on that device. IOStdReq - a pointer to a standard request block 0 - a flag field of zero (CONFLAG_DEFAULT) 1 - a flag field of one (CONFLAG_NODRAW_ON_NEWSIZE) (V37) RESULTS error - zero if successful, else an error is returned. NOTES As noted above, opening the console.device with a unit number of 3 allows the user to drag select text, and copy the selection with RIGHT AMIGA C. The snip is copied to a private buffered managed by the console.device (as of V36). The snip can be copied to any console.device window unless you are running a console to clipboard utility such as that provided with V37. The user pastes text into console.device windows by pressing RIGHT AMIGA V. Both RIGHT AMIGA V, and RIGHT AMIGA C are swallowed by the console.device (unless you have asked for key presses as RAW INPUT EVENTS). Text pasted in this way appears in the console read stream as if the user had typed all of the characters manually. Additional input (e.g., user input, RAW INPUT EVENTS) are queued up after pastes. Pastes can theoretically be quite large, though they are no larger than the amount of text which is visible in a console.device window. When running the console to clipboard utility, text snips are copied to the clipboard.device, and RIGHT AMIGA V key presses are broadcast as an escape sequence as part of the console.device read stream (" 0 v" - $9B,$30,$20,$76). It is left up to the application to decide what to do when this escape sequence is received. Ideally the application will read the contents of the clipboard, and paste the text by using successive writes to the console.device. Because the contents of the clipboard.device can be quite large, your program should limit the size of writes to something reasonable (e.g., no more than 1K characters per CMD_WRITE , and ideally no more than 256 characters per write). Your program should continue to read events from the console.device looking for user input, and possibly RAW INPUT EVENTS. How you decide to deal with these events is left up to the application. If you are using a character mapped console you should receive Intuition events as RAW INPUT EVENTS from the console.device. By doing this you will hear about these events after the console device does. This allows the console.device to deal with events such as window resizing, and refresh before your application.
