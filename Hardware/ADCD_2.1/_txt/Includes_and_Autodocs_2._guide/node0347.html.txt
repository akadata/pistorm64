exec.library/Debug ]" border=0> NAME Debug -- run the system debugger SYNOPSIS Debug(flags) D0 void Debug(ULONG); FUNCTION This function calls the system debugger. By default this debugger is "ROM-WACK". Other debuggers are encouraged to take over this entry point (via SetFunction() ) so that when an application calls Debug(), the alternative debugger will get control. Currently a zero is passed to allow future expansion. NOTE The Debug() call may be made when the system is in a questionable state; if you have a SetFunction() patch, make few assumptions, be prepared for Supervisor mode, and be aware of differences in the Motorola stack frames on the 68000,'10,'20, and '30.
