clipboard.device/CMD_READ ]" border=0> NAME CMD_READ -- Read from a clip on the clipboard. FUNCTION The read function serves two purposes. When io_Offset is within the clip, this acts as a normal read request, and io_Data is filled with data from the clipboard. The first read request should have a zero io_ClipID, which will be filled with the ID assigned for this read. Normal sequential access from the beginning of the clip is achieved by setting io_Offset to zero for the first read, then leaving it untouched for subsequent reads. If io_Data is null, then io_Offset is incremented by io_Actual as if io_Length bytes had been read: this is useful to skip to the end of file by using a huge io_Length. When io_Offset is beyond the end of the clip, this acts as a signal to the clipboard device that the application is through reading this clip. Realize that while an application is in the middle of reading a clip, any attempts to write new data to the clipboard are held off. This read past the end of file indicates that those operations may now be initiated.
