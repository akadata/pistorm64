(V36) SYNOPSIS UnlockPubScreen( Name, [Screen] ) A0 A1 VOID UnlockPubScreen( UBYTE *, struct Screen * ); FUNCTION Releases lock gotten by LockPubScreen() . It is best to identify the locked public screen by the pointer returned from LockPubScreen() . To do this, supply a NULL 'Name' pointer and the screen pointer. In rare circumstances where it would be more convenient to pass a non-NULL pointer to the public screen name string, the 'Screen' parameter is ignored. INPUTS Name = pointer to name of public screen. If Name is NULL, then argument 'Screen' is used as a direct pointer to a public screen. Screen = pointer to a public screen. Used only if Name is NULL. This pointer MUST have been returned by LockPubScreen() . It is safe to call UnlockPubScreen() with NULL Name and Screen (the function will have no effect).
