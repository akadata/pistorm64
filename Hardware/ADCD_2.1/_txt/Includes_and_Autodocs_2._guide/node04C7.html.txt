narrator.device/CMD_WRITE ]" border=0> NAME CMD_WRITE - Send speech request to the narrator device SYNOPSIS Standard device command. FUNCTION Sends a phonetic string to the narrator device to be spoken and, optionally, is used to direct the narrator device to return mouth shape changes, and word and syllable sync events in response to read requests from the user. The phonetic string consists of ASCII characters representing the individual phonemes. Refer to the narrator device chapter of the libraries and devices volume of the ROM Kernel Manual for detailed information. INPUTS User IORequest block (struct narrator_rb as defined in .h file). The OpenDevice call will initialize the IORequest block to a "standard male" voice. If you want to change any parms, do so after the OpenDevice call and before the DoIO (or SendIO/WaitIO). For a complete description of the narrator_rb structure, see the narrator.h or .i include file. Note that the OpenDevice call does not initialize all the fields needed by the narrator device. The IORequest fields which must be set by the user before issuing the write request are: io_Command - Set to CMD_WRITE io_Data - Pointer to phonetic string io_Length - Length of phonetic string ch_masks - Array of audio channel selection masks (see audio device documentation for description of this field) nm_masks - Number of audio channel selection masks ****** NEW FOR V37 NARRATOR flags - The bit NDB_NEWIORB must be set in the flags field if any of the new features of the V37 narrator are used In addition to producing synthetic speech, the narrator device also provides features for synchronizing the speech to animation or other user defined events. There are three types of events that the user can request. They are mouth shape changes, start of new word, and start of new syllable. Mouth shape changes are requested by setting the mouths field of the IORequest block to a non-zero value. Word and syllable sync events are requested by setting the NDB_WORDSYNC and/or NDB_SYLSYNC bits in the flags field of the IORequest block. Note that word and syllable sync only work in V37 and later versions of the narrator device. RESULTS The narrator device range checks and performs other validity checks for all input parms. If any input is in error, the device sets the io_Error field of the IORequest block to an appropriate value (see include files for error codes). If everything is in order, the narrator device will produce the speech and clear the io_Error field. The io_Actual field is set to the length of the input string that was actually processed. If the return code indicates a phoneme error (ND_PhonErr), io_Actual is the NEGATIVE of the position in the input string where the error occured. SEE ALSO Read command. Audio device documentation.
