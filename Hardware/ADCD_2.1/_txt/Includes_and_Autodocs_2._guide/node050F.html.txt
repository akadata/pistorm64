keyboard.device/KBD_READMATRIX ]" border=0> NAME KBD_READMATRIX -- Read the current keyboard key matrix. FUNCTION This function reads the up/down state of every key in the key matrix. IO REQUEST INPUT io_Message mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice io_Command KBD_READMATRIX io_Flags IOB_QUICK set if quick I/O is possible io_Length the size of the io_Data area in bytes: this must be big enough to hold the key matrix. io_Data a buffer area to fill with the key matrix: an array of bytes whose component bits reflect each keys state: the state of the key for keycode n is at bit (n MOD 8) in byte (n DIV 8) of this matrix. IO REQUEST OUTPUT io_Error IOERR_BADLENGTH - the io_Length was not exactly 13 bytes. The buffer is unchanged. This is only returned by V33/V34 kickstart. io_Actual the number of bytes filled in io_Data with key matrix data, i.e. the minimum of the supplied length and the internal key matrix size. NOTE For V33/V34 Kickstart, io_Length must be set to exactly 13 bytes. RESULTS This function sets the error field in the IORequest , and sets matrix to the current key matrix.
