workbench.library/AddAppWindowA ]" border=0> NAME AddAppWindow - add a window to workbench's list of appwindows. (V36) SYNOPSIS AppWindow = AddAppWindowA(id, userdata, window, msgport, taglist) D0 D0 D1 A0 A1 A2 struct AppWindow *AddAppWindowA(ULONG, ULONG, struct Window *, struct MsgPort *, struct TagItem *); Alternate, varargs version: struct AppWindow *AddAppWindow(ULONG, ULONG, struct Window *, struct MsgPort * tag1, data1, tag2, data2, ... TAG_END ); FUNCTION Attempt to add the window to workbench's list of appwindows. Normally non-workbench windows (those not opened by workbench) cannot have icons dropped in them. This call is provided to allow applications to be notified when an icon or icons get dropped inside a window that they have registered with workbench. The notification consists of an AppMessage (found in workbench.h/i) of type 'MTYPE_APPWINDOW' arriving at the message port you specified. What you do with the list of icons (pointed to by am_ArgList) is up to you, but generally you would want to call GetDiskObjectNew on them. INPUTS id - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by workbench. Typical uses in C are in switch and case statements, and in assembly language table lookup. userdata - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by workbench. window - pointer to window to add. msgport - pointer to message port workbench will use to send you an AppMessage message of type 'MTYPE_APPWINDOW' when your window gets an icon or icons dropped in it. taglist - ptr to a list of tag items. Must be NULL for V2.0. RESULTS AppWindow - a pointer to an appwindow structure which you pass to RemoveAppWindow when you want to remove the window from workbench's list of appwindows. NULL if workbench was unable to add your window; typically happens when workbench is not running or under low memory conditions. SEE ALSO RemoveAppWindow() NOTES The V2.0 icon editor is an example of an app window. Note that app window applications generally want to call GetDiskObjectNew (as opposed to GetDiskObject) to get the disk object for the icon dropped in the window.
