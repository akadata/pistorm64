(V36) SYNOPSIS MapTags(tagList, mapList, includeMiss) A0 A1 D0 void MapTags(struct TagItem *tagList, struct TagItem mapList, LONG includeMiss); FUNCTION Apply a "mapping list" mapList to tagList: If the ti_Tag field of an item in tagList appears as ti_Tag in some item in mapList, overwrite ti_Tag with the corresponding ti_Data from the map list. If a tag in tagList does not appear in the mapList, you can choose to have it removed by changing it to TAG_IGNORE. Do this by setting includeMiss to FALSE. If you want to have items which do not appear in the mapList survive the mapping as-is, set includeMiss to 1. This is central to gadget interconnections where you want to convert the tag values from one space (the sender) to another (the receiver). INPUTS tagList - Input list of tag items which is to be mapped to Tag values as specified in mapList. mapList - a "mapping list" tagItem list which pairs Tag values expected to appear in tagList with new values to be substituted in the ti_Tag fields of tagList. May be NULL, which means that all items in tagList will be eliminated. includeMiss - 0 to remove tags from tagList not in mapList, 1 to remove RESULT None. EXAMPLE /* Consider this source list: */ struct TagItem list[] = { { MY_SIZE, 71 }, { MY_WEIGHT, 200 }, { TAG_END, } }; /* And the mapping list: */ struct TagItem map[] = { { MY_SIZE, HIS_TALL }, { TAG_END, } }; /* Then after MapTags( list, map, 0 ), 'list' will become: */ { HIS_TALL, 71 }, { TAG_IGNORE, }, { TAG_END, } /* Then after MapTags( list, map, 1 ), 'list' will become: */ { HIS_TALL, 71 }, { MY_WEIGHT, 200 }, { TAG_END, } NOTES The procedure will change the values of the input tag list tagList (but not mapList). You can "filter" a list by passing includeMiss as 0, and having the data items in the map list equal the corresponding tags. You can perform the inverse filter ("everything but") by passing includeMiss equal to 1, and creating a map item for every tag you want to filter out, pairing it with a mapped data value of TAG_IGNORE. For safety and "order independence" of tag item arrays, if you attempt to map some tag to the value TAG_END, the value TAG_IGNORE will be substituted instead.
