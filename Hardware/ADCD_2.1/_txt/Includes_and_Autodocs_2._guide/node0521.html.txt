TITLE: trackdisk.device/CMD_UPDATE

trackdisk.device/CMD_UPDATE ]" border=0> NAME CMD_UPDATE/ETD_UPDATE -- write out the track buffer if it is dirty. FUNCTION The trackdisk device does not write data sectors unless it is necessary (you request that a different track be used) or until the user requests that an update be performed. This improves system speed by caching disk operations. These commands ensure that any buffered data is flushed out to the disk. If the track buffer has not been changed since the track was read in, these commands do nothing. ETD_UPDATE command checks for diskchange. IO REQUEST INPUT io_Device preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Unit preset by the call to OpenDevice() io_Command CMD_UPDATE or ETD_UPDATE io_Flags 0 or IOF_QUICK iotd_Count (ETD_UPDATE only) maximum allowable change counter value. IO REQUEST RESULT io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in SEE ALSO CMD_WRITE [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
