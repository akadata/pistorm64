amiga.lib/sprintf ]" border=0> NAME sprintf - format a C-like string into a string buffer. SYNOPSIS sprintf(destination formatstring [,value [, values] ] ); FUNCTION Performs string formatting identical to printf , but directs the output into a specific destination in memory. This uses the ROM version of printf (exec.library/RawDoFmt() ), so it is very small. Assembly programmers can call this by placing values on the stack, followed by a pointer to the formatstring, followed by a pointer to the destination string. INPUTS destination - the address of an area in memory into which the formatted output is to be placed. formatstring - pointer to a null terminated string describing the desired output formatting (see printf() for a description of this string). value(s) - numeric information to be formatted into the output stream.
