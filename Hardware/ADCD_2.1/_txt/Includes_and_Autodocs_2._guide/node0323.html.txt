exec.library/AbortIO ]" border=0> NAME AbortIO - attempt to abort an in-progress I/O request SYNOPSIS AbortIO(iORequest) A1 VOID AbortIO(struct IORequest *); FUNCTION Ask a device to abort a previously started IORequest . This is done by calling the device's ABORTIO vector, with your given IORequest . AbortIO is a command the device that may or may not grant. If successful, the device will stop processing the IORequest , and reply to it earlier than it would otherwise have done. NOTE AbortIO() does NOT Remove() the IORequest from your ReplyPort, OR wait for it to complete. After an AbortIO() you must wait normally for the reply message before actually reusing the request. If a request has already completed when AbortIO() is called, no action is taken. EXAMPLE AbortIO(timer_request); WaitIO(timer_request); /* Message is free to be reused */ INPUTS iORequest - pointer to an I/O request block (must have been used at least once. May be active or finished). SEE ALSO WaitIO , DoIO , SendIO , CheckIO [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
