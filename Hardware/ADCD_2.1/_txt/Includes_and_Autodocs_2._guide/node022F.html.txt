(V36) SYNOPSIS object = NewObjectA( class, classID, tagList ) D0 A0 A1 A2 APTR NewObjectA( struct IClass *, UBYTE *, struct TagItem * ); object = NewObject( class, classID, Tag1, ... ) APTR NewObject( struct IClass *, UBYTE *, ULONG, ... ); FUNCTION This is the general method of creating objects from 'boopsi' classes. ('Boopsi' stands for "basic object-oriented programming system for Intuition".) You specify a class either as a pointer (for a private class) or by its ID string (for public classes). If the class pointer is NULL, then the classID is used. You further specify initial "create-time" attributes for the object via a TagItem list, and they are applied to the resulting generic data object that is returned. The attributes, their meanings, attributes applied only at create-time, and required attributes are all defined and documented on a class-by-class basis. INPUTS class = abstract pointer to a boopsi class gotten via MakeClass() . classID = the name/ID string of a public class. This parameter is only used if 'class' is NULL. tagList = pointer to array of TagItems containing attribute/value pairs to be applied to the object being created RESULT A boopsi object, which may be used in different contexts such as a gadget or image, and may be manipulated by generic functions. You eventually free the object using DisposeObject() . NOTES This function invokes the OM_NEW "method" for the class specified. BUGS Typedef's for 'Object' and 'Class' are defined in the include files but not used consistently. The generic type APTR is probably best used for object and class "handles", with the type (UBYTE *) used for classID strings.
