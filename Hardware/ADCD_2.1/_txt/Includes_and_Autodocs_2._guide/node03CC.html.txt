SYNOPSIS result = SPTst(fnum) D0 D1 int SPTst(float fnum); FUNCTION Accepts a floating point number and returns the condition codes set to indicate the result of a comparison against the value of zero (0.0). Additionally, the integer functional result is returned. INPUTS fnum - floating point number. RESULT Condition codes set to reflect the following branches: EQ - fnum = 0.0 NE - fnum != 0.0 PL - fnum >= 0.0 MI - fnum fnum > 0.0 -1 => fnum fnum = 0.0 BUGS None.
