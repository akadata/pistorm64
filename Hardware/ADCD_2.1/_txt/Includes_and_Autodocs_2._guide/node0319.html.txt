rexxsyslib.library/CreateArgstring ]" border=0> NAME CreateArgstring - Create an argument string structure SYNOPSIS argstr = CreateArgstring(string, length) D0,A0 A0 D0 UBYTE *CreateArgstring(UBYTE *, ULONG); FUNCTION Allocates a RexxArg structure and copies the supplied string into it. The returned pointer points at the string part of the structure and can be treated like an ordinary string pointer. (However, care must be taken that you do not change the string) INPUTS string - A pointer at your input string length - The number of bytes of your input string you wish copied. (NOTE: You are limited to 65,535 byte strings) RESULTS argstr - A pointer to the argument string. The results are returned in both A0 and D0. You should always check the result as an allocation failure would cause an error. SEE ALSO DeleteArgstring() , LengthArgstring() , ClearRexxMsg() , FillRexxMsg() BUGS [Back to Amiga Developer Docs ]
