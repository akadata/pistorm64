This section describes in detail the procedure used to specify phonetic
strings to the narrator speech synthesizer. No previous experience with
phonetics is required. The only thing you may need is a good pronunciation
dictionary for those times when you doubt your own ears. You do not have
to learn a foreign language or computer language. You are just going to
learn how to write down the English that comes out of your own mouth. In
writing phonetically you do not have to know how a word is spelled, just
<a name="line9">how it is said.</a>

                          Digits and Punctuation

    Digits 1-9    Syllabic stress, ranging from secondary through emphatic
    .             Period - sentence final character.
    ?             Question mark - sentence final character
    -             Dash - phrase delimiter
    ,             Comma - clause delimiter
    ()            Parentheses - noun phrase delimiters (see text)

The narrator device  works on utterances at the sentence level.  Even if
you want to say only one word, it will treat it as a complete sentence.
Therefore, narrator wants one of two punctuation marks to appear at the
end of every sentence - a period or a question mark.  The period is used
for almost all utterances and will cause a final fall in pitch to occur at
the end of a sentence.  The question mark is used at the end of yes/no
questions only, and results in a final rise in pitch.

For example, the question, Do you enjoy using your Amiga? would take a
question mark at the end, while the question, What is your favorite color?
should be followed (in the phonetic transcription) with a period.  If no
punctuation appears at the end of a string, narrator will append a dash to
it, which will result in a short pause.  Narrator recognizes other
punctuation marks as well, but these are left for later discussion.
