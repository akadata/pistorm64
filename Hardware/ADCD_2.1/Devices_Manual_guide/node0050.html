The printer special flags (io_Flags) of the <a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node0044.html#line23">IODRPReq</a> provide a high degree
<a name="line3">of control over the printing of a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node00AF.html#line55">RastPort</a>.</a>

   SPECIAL_ASPECT       Allows one of the dimensions to be
                        reduced/expanded to preserve the correct
                        aspect ratio of the printout.

   SPECIAL_CENTER       Centers the image between the left and right
<a name="line10">                        edge of the paper.</a>

   SPECIAL_NOFORMFEED   Prevents the page from being ejected after
                        a graphics dump.  Usually used to mix graphics and
<a name="line14">                        text or multiple graphics dump on a page oriented</a>
<a name="line15">                        printer (normally a laser printer).</a>

   SPECIAL_NOPRINT      The print size will be computed, and set
                        in io_DestCols and io_DestRows, but won't print.
                        This way the application can see what the actual
                        printsize in printerpixels would be.

   SPECIAL_TRUSTME      Instructs the printer not to send a reset
                        before and after the dump.  This flag is obsolete
                        for V1.3 (and higher) drivers.

   SPECIAL_DENSITY1-7   This flag bit is set by the user in Preferences.
                        Refer to &#034;Reading and Changing the Printer
                        <a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node004C.html">Preferences Settings</a>&#034; if you want to change to
                        density of the printout. (Or any other setting for
                        that matter.)

   SPECIAL_FULLCOLS     The width is set to the maximum possible,
                        as determined by the printer or the configuration
                        limits.

   SPECIAL_FULLROWS     The height is set to the maximum possible, as
                        determined by the printer or the configuration
                        limits.

   SPECIAL_FRACCOLS     Informs the printer device that the value in
                        io_DestCols is to be taken as a longword binary
                        fraction of the maximum for the dimension.  For
                        example, if io_DestCols is 0x8000, the width
                        would be 1/2 (0x8000 / 0xffff) of the width of
                        the paper.

   SPECIAL_FRACROWS     Informs the printer device that the value in
                        io_DestRows is to be taken as a longword binary
                        fraction for the dimension.

   SPECIAL_MILCOLS      Informs the printer device that the value in
                        io_DestCols is specified in thousandths of an inch.
                        For example, if io_DestCols is 8000, the width of
                        the printout would be 8.000 inches.

   SPECIAL_MILROWS      Informs the printer device that the value in
                        io_DestRows is specified in thousandths of an inch.

The flags are defined in the include file devices/<a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0052.html">printer.h</a>.
