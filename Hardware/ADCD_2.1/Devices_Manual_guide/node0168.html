This memo is the IFF supplement for FORM FTXT.  An FTXT is an IFF &#034;data
section&#034; or &#034;<a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node01C7.html#line51">FORM</a> type&#034; - which can be an IFF file or a part of one -
containing a stream of text plus optional formatting information.
<a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node01C5.html">EA IFF 85</a> is Electronic Arts' standard for interchange format files.
(See the IFF reference.)

An FTXT is an archival and interchange representation designed for three
uses. The simplest use is for a &#034;console device&#034; or &#034;glass teletype&#034; (the
minimal 2-D text layout means): a stream of &#034;graphic&#034; (&#034;printable&#034;)
characters plus positioning characters &#034;space&#034; (&#034;SP&#034;) and line terminator
(&#034;LF&#034;).  This is not intended for cursor movements on a screen although it
does not conflict with standard cursor-moving characters.  The second use
is text that has explicit formatting information (or &#034;looks&#034;) such as font
family and size, typeface, etc.  The third use is as the lowest layer of a
structured document that also has &#034;inherited&#034; styles to implicitly control
character looks.  For that use, FORMs FTXT would be embedded within a
future document <a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node01C7.html#line51">FORM</a> type.  The beauty of FTXT is that these three uses
are interchangeable, that is, a program written for one purpose can read
and write the others' files.  So a word processor does not have to write a
separate plain text file to communicate with other programs.

Text is stored in one or more &#034;<a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node016D.html">CHRS</a>&#034; chunks inside an FTXT.  Each CHRS
contains a stream of 8-bit text compatible with ISO and ANSI data
interchange standards.  FTXT uses just the central character set from the
ISO/ANSI standards.  (These two standards are henceforth called &#034;ISO/ANSI&#034;
as in &#034;see the ISO/ANSI reference&#034;.)

Since it's possible to extract just the text portions from future document
<a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node01C7.html#line51">FORM</a> types, programs can exchange data without having to save both plain
text and formatted text representations.

Character looks are stored as embedded control sequences within <a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node016D.html">CHRS</a>
chunks. This document specifies which class of control sequences to use:
the CSI group.  This document does not yet specify their meanings, e.g.,
which one means &#034;turn on italic face&#034;.  Consult ISO/ANSI.

Section 2 defines the chunk types character stream &#034;<a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node016D.html">CHRS</a>&#034; and font
specifier &#034;<a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node016E.html">FONS</a>&#034;.  These are the &#034;standard&#034; chunks.  Specialized chunks
for private or future needs can be added later.  Section 3 outlines an
FTXT reader program that strips a document down to plain unformatted text.
<a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node0172.html">Appendix A</a> is a code table for the 8-bit ISO/ANSI character set used here.
<a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node0173.html">Appendix B</a> is an example FTXT shown as a box diagram.  <a href="../Devices_Manual_guide/node0174.html">Appendix C</a> is a
racetrack diagram of the syntax of ISO/ANSI control sequences.
