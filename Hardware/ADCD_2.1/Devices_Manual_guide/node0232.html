Animated bitmap form (Framer, Deluxe Video)

TITLE:  Form ANBM (animated bitmap form used by Framer, Deluxe Video)

(note from the author)

The format was designed for simplicity at a time when the IFF standard was
very new and strange to us all.  It was not designed to be a general
purpose animation format.  It was intended to be a private format for use
by DVideo, with the hope that a more powerful format would emerge as the
Amiga became more popular.

I hope you will publish this format (and we did!) so that other formats
will not inadvertantly conflict with it.

PURPOSE:  To define simple animated bitmaps for use in DeluxeVideo.

In Deluxe Video objects appear and move in the foreground with a picture
in the background.  Objects are &#034;small&#034; bitmaps usually saved as brushes
from DeluxePaint and pictures are large full screen bitmaps saved as files
from DeluxePaint.

Two new chunk headers are defined: ANBM and FSQN.

An animated bitmap (ANBM) is a series of bitmaps of the same size and
depth.  Each bitmap in the series is called a frame and is labeled by a
character, 'a b c ...' in the order they appear in the file.

The frame sequence chunk (FSQN) specifies the playback sequence of the
individual bitmaps to achieve animation. FSQN_CYCLE and FSQN_TOFRO specify
two algorithmic sequences.  If neither of these bits is set, an arbitrary
sequence can be used instead.


    ANBM         - identifies this file as an animated bitmap
    .FSQN        - playback sequence information
    .LIST ILBM   - LIST allows following ILBMs to share properties
    ..PROP ILBM  - properties follow
    ...BMHD      - bitmap header defines common size and depth
    ...CMAP      - colormap defines common colors
    ..FORM ILBM  - first frame follows
    ..BODY       - the first frame
       .         - FORM ILBM and BODY for each remaining frame
       .
       .
