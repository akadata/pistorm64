Like &#034;8SVX&#034;, this new format uses headers to separate the various sections
of the sound file into chunks. Some of the chunks are exactly the same
since there wasn't a need to improve them. The chunks that remain
unchanged are as follows:

   &#034;(c) &#034;
   &#034;AUTH&#034;
   &#034;ANNO&#034;

Since these properties are all described in the original &#034;8SVX&#034; document,
please refer to that for a description of these chunks and their uses.
Like the &#034;8SVX&#034; form, none of these chunks are required to be in a sound
file. If they do appear, they must be padded out to an even number of
bytes.

Furthermore, two &#034;8SVX&#034; chunks no longer exist as they have been incorpo-
rated into the &#034;BODY&#034; chunk. They are:

   &#034;ATAK&#034;
   &#034;RLSE&#034;

Since each wave can be completely different than the other waves in the
sound file (one wave might be middle C on a piano, and another might be a
snare drum hit), it is necessary for each wave to have its own envelope
description, and name.

The major changes from the &#034;8SVX&#034; format are in the &#034;MHDR&#034;, &#034;NAME&#034;, and
&#034;BODY&#034; chunks.
