The following table lists functions that the console device supports,
along with the character stream that you must send to the console to
produce the effect.  For more information on the control sequences,
consult the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node0500.html">console.doc</a> of the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Includes
and Autodocs. The table uses the second form of &#060;CSI&#062;, that is, the hex
value 0x9B, to minimize the number of characters to be transmitted to
produce a function.

A couple of notes about the table. If an item is enclosed in square
brackets, it is optional and may be omitted.  For example, for INSERT [N]
CHARACTERS the value for N is shown as optional.  The console device
responds to such optional items by treating the value of N as 1 if it is
not specified. The value of N or M is always a decimal number, having one
or more ASCII digits to express its value.

    SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION                  9B N 3B 3N 3B 4N 3B &#062;N 6D
    (select text style, character color,      (See note below).
     character cell color,background color)

For SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION, any number of parameters, in any order,
are valid. They are separated by semicolons.

The parameters follow:

    &#060;text style&#062; =

        0  Plain text                      8   Concealed mode
        1  Boldface                        22  Normal color, not bold (V36)
        2  faint (secondary color)         23  Italic off (V36)
        3  Italic                          24  Underscore off (V36)
        4  Underscore                      27  Reversed off (V36)
        7  Reversed character/cell colors  28  Concealed off (V36)

    &#060;character color&#062; =

        30-37  System colors 0-7 for character color.
        39     Reset to default character color
               Transmitted as two ASCII characters.

    &#060;character cell color&#062; =

        40-47  System colors 0-7 for character cell color.
        39     Reset to default character color
               Transmitted as two ASCII characters.

    &#060;background color&#062; =

        &#062;0-7System colors 0-7 for background color.(V36)
        You must specify the &#034;&#062;&#034; in order for this to
        be recognized and it must be the last parameter.

For example, to select bold face, with color 3 as the character color, and
color 0 as the character cell color and the background color, send the hex
sequence:

    9B 31 3B 33 33 3B 34 30 3B 3E 30 6D

representing the ASCII sequence:

    &#060;CSI&#062;1;33;40;&#062;0m

where &#060;CSI&#062; is the control sequence introducer, here used as the single
character value 0x9B.

   Go Easy On The Eyes.
   --------------------
   In most cases, the character cell color and the background color
   should be the same.
