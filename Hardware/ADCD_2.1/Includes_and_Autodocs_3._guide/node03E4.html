<b>    NAME</b>
	ReportMouse -- Tell Intuition whether to report mouse movement.

<b>    SYNOPSIS</b>
	ReportMouse( Boolean, <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> )
		     D0       A0	&#060;-note

	VOID ReportMouse( <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0654.html#line73">BOOL</a>, struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> * );

<b>    SPECIAL NOTE</b>
	Some compilers and link files switch the arguments to this function
	about in unpredictable ways.  We apologize for this confusion
	wrapped around an error enclosing a mistake.
	The call will take one of two forms:

		ReportMouse(Boolean, Window);
			-or-
		ReportMouse(Window, (ULONG)Boolean);

	The first form is the one that corresponds to the amiga.lib supplied
	by Commodore.  The linker libraries and &#034;pragmas&#034; of some compilers
	supply the alternate form.

	A key point to remember is that the form of the function in ROM
	has always been the same, so there has always been object code
	compatibility.  However some care should be taken when switching
	compilers or switching between stubs and pragmas.

	From assembler the interface has always been:
		Boolean in D0, <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> in A0

	Also, it is still endorsed to simply set the WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag bit
	in Window-&#062;Flags, or reset it, on your own.  Make the operation
	an atomic assembly instruction (OR.W #WFLG_REPORTMOUSE,wd_Flags+2(A0)
	where A0 contains your window pointer).  Most compilers will produce
	an atomic operation when faced with:
			Window-&#062;Flags |= WFLG_REPORTMOUSE;
			Window-&#062;Flags &#038;=~WFLG_REPORTMOUSE;
	or else bracket the operation between <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0224.html">Forbid()/Permit()</a>.

<b>    FUNCTION</b>
	Tells Intuition whether or not to broadcast mouse-movement events to
	your window when it's the active one.  The Boolean value specifies
	whether to start or stop broadcasting position information of
	mouse-movement.  If the window is the active one, mouse-movement reports
	start coming immediately afterwards.  This same routine will change
	the current state of the GACT_FOLLOWMOUSE function of a
	currently-selected gadget too.

	Note that calling ReportMouse() when a gadget is selected will only
	temporarily change whether or not mouse	movements are reported while
	that gadget remains selected; the next time the gadget is selected, its
	GACT_FOLLOWMOUSE flag is examined anew.

	Note also that calling ReportMouse() when no gadget is currently
	selected will change the state of the window's WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag,
	but will have no effect on any gadget that may be subsequently
	selected. (This is all fixed in V36.)

	The ReportMouse() function is first performed when <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node03D5.html">OpenWindow()</a>
	is first called; if the flag WFLG_REPORTMOUSE is included among
	the options, then all mouse-movement events are reported
	to the opening task and will continue to be reported
	until ReportMouse() is called with a Boolean value of FALSE.
	If WFLG_REPORTMOUSE is not set, then no mouse-movement reports will
	be broadcast until ReportMouse() is called with a Boolean of TRUE.

	Note that the WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag, as managed by this routine,
	determines IF mouse messages are to be broadcast.  Determining HOW
	they are to be broadcast is determined by the IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE
	IDCMPFlag.

	Boolean = TRUE or FALSE value specifying whether to turn this
             function on or off

	None
