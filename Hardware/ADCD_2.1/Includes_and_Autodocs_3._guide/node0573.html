<b>   TIMER REQUEST</b>
	A time request is a non standard IO <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node03E5.html">Request</a>.  It has an <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0621.html#line17">IORequest</a>
	followed by a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line29">timeval</a> structure or an eclockval structure.

<b>   TIMEVAL</b>
	A <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line29">timeval</a> structure consists of two longwords.  The first is
	the number of seconds, the latter is the fractional number
	of microseconds.  The microseconds must always be &#034;normalized&#034;
	e.g. the longword must be between 0 and one million.

<b>   ECLOCKVAL</b>
	A eclockval structure consists of two longwords.  The first is
	the high order 32 bits of a 64 bit number and the second is the
	the low order 32 bits.  The 64 bit number is a count of &#034;E&#034; clock
	ticks.  The &#034;E&#034; clock frequency is related to the master clock
	frequency of the machine and can be determined by calling the
	<a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0578.html">ReadEClock()</a> library like call.

<b>   UNITS</b>
	The timer contains five units -- two designed to accuratly measure
	short intervals, one that has little system overhead and is very
	stable over time, and two that work like an alarm clock.

<b>   UNIT_MICROHZ</b>
	This unit uses the programmable timers in the 8520s to keep track
	of its time.  It has precision down to about 2 microseconds, but
	will drift as system load increases.  The accuracy of this unit
	is the same as that of the master clock of the machine.  This unit
	uses a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line29">timeval</a> in its <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line39">timerequest</a>.

<b>   UNIT_VBLANK</b>
	This unit uses a strobe from the power supply to keep track of its
	time or the &#034;E&#034; clock on machines without power supply strobes.
	It is very stable over time, but only has a resolution of that of
	the vertical blank interrupt.  This unit is very cheap to use, and
	should be used by those who are waiting for long periods of time
	(typically 1/2 second or more).  This unit uses a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line29">timeval</a> in its
	<a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line39">timerequest</a>.

<b>   UNIT_ECLOCK</b>
	This unit is exacly the same as UNIT_MICROHZ except that it uses
	an eclockval instead of a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line29">timeval</a> in its <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line39">timerequest</a>.

<b>   UNIT_WAITUNTIL</b>
	This unit waits until the systime is greater than or equal to the
	time in the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line29">timeval</a> in the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line39">timerequest</a>.  This unit has the same
	resolution and accuracy as that of UNIT_VBLANK.

<b>   UNIT_WAITECLOCK</b>
	This unit waits until the E-Clock value as returned by <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0578.html">ReadEClock()</a>
	is greater than or equal to the eclockval in the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0607.html#line39">timerequest</a>. This
	unit has the same resolution and accuracy as that of UNIT_ECLOCK.

<b>   LIBRARY</b>
	In addition to the normal device calls, the timer also supports
	several direct, library like calls.

<b>   BUGS</b>
	In the V1.2/V1.3 release, the timer device has problems with
	very short time requests.  When one of these is made, other
	timer requests may be finished inaccurately.  A side effect
	is that AmigaDOS requests such as &#034;Delay(0);&#034; or
	&#034;WaitForChar(x,0);&#034; are unreliable.
