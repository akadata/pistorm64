<b>   NAME</b>
	OpenLibrary -- gain access to a library

<b>   SYNOPSIS</b>
	library = OpenLibrary(libName, version)
	D0		      A1       D0

	struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0626.html#line33">Library</a> *OpenLibrary(STRPTR, ULONG);

<b>   FUNCTION</b>
	This function returns a pointer to a library that was previously
	installed into the system.  If the requested library is exists, and
	if the library version is greater than or equal to the requested
	version, then the open will succeed.

	The library may exist in memory, or on disk; this is transparent to
	the OpenLibrary caller.  Only Processes are allowed to call
	OpenLibrary (since OpenLibrary may in turn call dos.library).

	A full path name for the library name is legitimate.  For example
	&#034;wp:libs/wp.library&#034;.  This allows the use of custom libraries
	without requiring the user to copy the library into the system's
	LIBS: directory.

<b>   NOTES</b>
	All calls to OpenLibrary should have matching calls to CloseLibrary!

	Libraries on disk cannot be opened until after DOS has been
	started.

	As of V36 tasks can safely call OpenLibrary, though DOS may open
	system requesters (e.g., asking the user to insert the Workbench
	disk if LIBS: is not online).  You must call this function from a
	DOS <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D9.html#line36">Process</a> if you want to turn off DOS requesters.

<b>   INPUTS</b>
	libName - the name of the library to open

	version - the version of the library required.

<b>   RESULTS</b>
	library - a library pointer for a successful open, else zero

<b>   BUGS</b>
	AmigaDOS file names are not case sensitive, but Exec lists are. If
	the library name is specified in a different case than it exists on
	disk, unexpected results may occur.

	Prior to V36, tasks could not make OpenLibrary calls requiring disk
	access (since tasks are not allowed to make dos.library calls).
	Now OpenLibrary is protected from tasks.

	The version number of the resident tag in disk based library must
	match the version number of the library, or V36 may fail to load it.
