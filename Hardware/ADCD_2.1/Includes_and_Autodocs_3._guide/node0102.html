<b>   NAME</b>
	CMD_WRITE -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node01D1.html">Write</a> ANSI text to the console display.

<b>   FUNCTION</b>
	<a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node01D1.html">Write</a> a text record to the display.  Interpret the ANSI
	control characters in the data as described below.  Note
	that the RPort of the console window is in use while this
	write command is pending.

<b>   IO REQUEST INPUT</b>
	io_Message	mn_ReplyPort set if quick I/O is not possible
	io_Device	preset by the call to <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0560.html">OpenDevice</a>
	io_Unit		preset by the call to <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0560.html">OpenDevice</a>
	io_Command	CMD_WRITE
	io_Flags	IOF_QUICK if quick I/O possible, else zero
	io_Length	sizeof(*buffer), or -1 if io_Data is null
			terminated
	io_Data		a pointer to a buffer containing the ANSI text
			to write to the console device.

<b>   IO REQUEST RESULTS</b>
	io_Error	the error result (no errors are reported as of V36)
	io_Actual	the number of bytes written from io_Data
	io_Length	zero
	io_Data		original io_Data plus io_Actual

<b>   ANSI CODES SUPPORTED</b>

	Codes are specified in the standard fashion for ANSI documents,
	as the two 4 bit nibbles that comprise the character code,
	high nibble first, separated by a slash.  Thus 01/11 (ESC) is
	a character with the hex value 1B (or the decimal value 27).

	A character on the Amiga falls into one of the following four
	ranges:
	00/ 0-01/15	C0: ASCII control characters.  See below.
	02/ 0-07/15	G0: ASCII graphic characters.  These characters
			have an image that is displayed.  Note that the
			DEL character is displayed by the Console Device:
			it is not treated as control character here.
	08/ 0-09/15	C1: ANSI 3.41 control characters.  See below.
	10/ 0-15/15	G1: ECMA 94 Latin 1 graphic characters.

<b>    NOTES</b>
	The console.device recognizes these SGR sequences.
	Note that some of these are new to V36.

	SGR (SELECT GRAPHICS RENDITION)
		Selects colors, and other display characteristics
		for text.

	Syntax:
		&#060;ESC&#062;[graphic-rendition...m

	Example:
		&#060;ESC&#062;[1;7m   (sets bold, and reversed text)

	Parameters:

		0	- Normal colors, and attributes
		1	- Set bold
		2	- Set faint (secondary color)
		3	- Set italic
		4	- Set underscore
		7	- Set reversed character/cell colors
		8	- Set concealed mode.
		22	- Set normal color, not bold	(V36)
		23	- Italic off			(V36)
		24	- Underscore off		(V36)
		27	- Reversed off			(V36)
		28	- Concealed off			(V36)

		30-37	- Set character color
		39	- Reset to default character color

		40-47	- Set character cell color
		49	- Reset to default character cell color

		&#062;0-7	- Set background color		(V36)
			  Used to set the background color before
			  any text is written.  The numeric parameter
			  is prefixed by &#034;&#062;&#034;.  This also means that if
			  you issue an SGR command with more than one
			  parameter, you must issue the digit only
			  parameters first, followed by any prefixed
			  parameters.

	V39 console.device takes advantage of the ability to mask
	bitplanes for faster scrolling, clearing, and rendering.
	The actual number of bitplanes scrolled depends on which
	colors you set via the SGR sequences.  For those using
	the defaults of PEN color 1, and cell color 0, console.device
	only needs to scroll 1 bitplane.  The actual number
	of bitplanes scrolled is reset when ESCc is sent, and when
	the console window is entirely cleared (e.g., FF).  In
	general this should cause no compatability problems, unless
	you are mixing console rendering with graphic.library calls
	in the same portions of your window.  Console.device considers
	the number of bitplanes it must scroll, and the screen display
	depth so that interleaved bitplane scrolling can be taken
	advantage of in cases where performance is not significantly
	affected (interleaved scrolling, and masking are mutually
	exclusive).  The determination of how many planes to scroll
	is undefined, and may change in the future.

	V39 console.device supports a new private sequence (aSDSS)
	intended for use by users who prefer to change their default
	SGR settings.  When this private Amiga sequence is sent to the
	console, the current Pen color, Cell color, <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0332.html">Text</a> style, and
	Reverse mode (on or off), are set as defaults.  When ESC[0m
	is issued, the settings are restored to the preferred settings.
	ESC[39m, and ESC[49m are likewise affected.  In general
	applications should not make use of this private sequence as it
	is intended for users who would normally include it as part of
	their shell startup script.  The normal defaults are reset
	when ESCc is issued.

<b>    BUGS</b>
	Does not correctly display cursor in SuperBitMap layers for
	versions prior to V36.

	Concealed mode should not be used prior to V39 console.device.
	Prior to V39 concealed mode masked all rastport output, the
	effect of which varied.  As of V39, text output is simply
	hidden by setting the pen colors.  Scrolling, clearing,
	cursor rendering, etc., are unaffected.  For maximum
	compatability it is recommended you simply set the colors
	yourself, and not used concealed mode.

	V36-V37 character mapped mode console.device windows could
	crash, or behave erratically if you scroll text DOWN more
	than a full window's worth of text.  This bug has been fixed
	in V39 console.  The only work-around is to avoid sending
	scroll down, or cursor up commands which exceed the window
	rows (this is not a problem for unit 0 console windows).
