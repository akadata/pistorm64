<b>   NAME</b>
       WM_HANDLEINPUT -- IDCMP input handling method

<b>   SYNOPSIS</b>
       result = DoMethod( winobj, WM_HANDLEINPUT, &#038;code );

<b>   FUNCTION</b>
       This method is used to handle the IDCMP input of a window. Call
       this method when the signal bit of the window's UserPort is
       set. This method will return when it encounters a message that
       requires notifying your application or when the message port no
       longer contains messages for the window.

       The return value is two-part. The upper word describes the
       class of the event the value represents, and the lower word is
       a modifier that describes the event.

       Defined class return codes are:

       WMHI_IGNORE            Ignore this event
       WMHI_LASTMSG        No more messages
       WMHI_CLOSEWINDOW    <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0149.html">Close</a> gadget hit
       WMHI_GADGETUP        <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line213">Gadget</a> hit.
       WMHI_INACTIVE        <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> went inactive.
       WMHI_ACTIVE            <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> was activated.
       WMHI_NEWSIZE        <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> was resized.
       WMHI_MENUPICK        A menu item was selected.
       WMHI_MENUHELP        Help was pressed in a menu.
       WMHI_GADGETHELP        A gadget sends a help message.
       WMHI_ICONIFY        <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> should be iconified.
       WMHI_UNICONIFY        <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> was deiconified.
       WMHI_RAWKEY            Raw key code
       WMHI_VANILLAKEY        Vanilla key code
       WMHI_CHANGEWINDOW    <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line908">Window</a> moved (or depth arranged)

       The value of the lower word is defined for WMHI_GADGETUP and
       WMHI_GADGETHELP as the ID of the gadget, and for WMHI_MENUPICK
       and WMHI_MENUHELP as the menu code. WMHI_GAGDETHELP uses the
       special values 0 and WMHI_GADGETMASK as messages &#034;pointer not
       over your window&#034; and &#034;pointer over your window but not over a
       gadget&#034;.

       WMHI_RAWKEY returns the raw key ID of the key being
       pressed (to get the qualifiers also, you have to use the IDCMP
       hook), and WMHI_VANILLAKEY returns the ASCII value of the key.
       WMHI_VANILLAKEY is only returned when you set IDCMP_VANILLAKEY.
       Windowclass itself does not need vanilla key IDCMP.

       WMHI_NEWSIZE returns some extra information in the low word:
       if WMF_ZOOMED is set, the window is now in zoomed state. If
       WMF_ZIPWINDOW is set, this resize was caused by either a
       click of the zoom gadget or a call to <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0407.html">ZipWindow()</a>.

       WMHI_CHANGEWINDOW is returned when the window is moved. For
       resizing of the window, listen to WMHI_NEWSIZE. By setting
       WA_NotifyDepth, this event will also be returned for depth
       arranging. The lower word contains CWCODE_DEPTH in this case.

       WMHI_CLASSMASK masks the lower word of the result code out,
       while WMHI_GADGETMASK and WMHI_MENUMASK mask out the high word,
       leaving only the ID part of the result value.

       A generic application side of WM_HANDLEINPUT looks like this:

       GetAttr( WINDOW_SigMask, winobj, &#038;wsig );

       mask = Wait(wsig);    /* maybe other signals */

       if (mask &#038; wsig)
           while ((result = DoMethod( winobj, WM_HANDLEINPUT, &#038;code ))
                   != WMHI_LASTMSG)
               switch (result &#038; WMHI_CLASSMASK)
               {
               case WMHI_CLOSEWINDOW:
                   close = TRUE;
                   break;

               case WMHI_GADGETUP:
                   switch (result &#038; WMHI_GADGETMASK)
                   {
                   /* handle the gadgets here */
                   }

               /* handle whatever other events you want here */
               }

       if (close)
           DisposeObject( winobj ); /* destroy the window */

       If you have set up the window to use a shared message port, you
       can simply call this method on each of the windows:

       if (mask &#038; wsig)
       {
           WmHandleInputWin1();
           WmHandleInputWin2();
           WmHandleInputWin3();
       }

<b>   INPUTS</b>
       code -- A pointer to a WORD that should be set to contain the
               Code value from the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line762">IntuiMessage</a>.

<b>   RESULTS</b>
       Windowclass will automatically respond with an appropriate
       action to many input events. When it does not know what to do
       with an event, it will return with a value as descibed above.
