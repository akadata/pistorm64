<b>    TAGS</b>
        DTA_TriggerMethods -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0628.html#line19">List</a> of the trigger methods supported.

            Applicability is (G).

        DTA_Methods -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0628.html#line19">List</a> of the methods supported.

            Applicability is (G).

        DTA_TextAttr (struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05EC.html#line64">TextAttr</a> *) -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0332.html">Text</a> attribute to use for
            the AmigaGuide database.

            Applicability is (ISG).

        DTA_Name (STRPTR) -- Name of the AmigaGuide database.

            Applicability is (I).

        DTA_Handle (BPTR) -- File handle for the AmigaGuide database.

            AmigaGuide will execute the commands &#034;ONOPEN&#034;, &#034;ONCLOSE&#034;,
            &#034;LINK RX&#034;, &#034;LINK RXS&#034; and &#034;LINK SYSTEM&#034;. These commands
            present a potential security hole if, for example,
            AmigaGuide documents are displayed in an e-mail reader
            program. To disabled them, set the AGA_Secure tag to
            TRUE; in this case AmigaGuide will still recognize the
            commands but will not execute them.

            Applicability is (ISG). Defaults to FALSE. (V41)

<b>    COMMANDS</b>
        Commands must start in the very first column of a line, and
        can be the only thing on the line.  If a line begins with an
        @ sign, then it is interpreted as a command.

        The following commands can be used in the global section
        of a database.

          @$VER: &#060;AmigaDOS version string&#062;
          Specify the version of the database.  This command
          must always be in upper-case.

          @(C) &#060;copyright&#062;
          Specify the copyright notice for the database.

          @AUTHOR &#060;name&#062;
          Specify the author of the database.

          @DATABASE &#060;name&#062;
          Must be the very first line of an AmigaGuide document.

          @DNODE &#060;name&#062;
          Indicates the start of a dynamic node.  The AmigaGuide system
          uses the callback hooks to obtain the document from a document
          provider.  This is obsolete, do not use.

          @FONT &#060;name&#062; &#060;size&#062;
          Specify the font to use for the database.

          @HEIGHT &#060;chars&#062;
          How high, in characters, the largest document is.

          @HELP &#060;name/node&#062;
          Specify the name of the help node, which will be accessed
          by the Help button.  Can be a node in an external database.

          @INDEX &#060;name/node&#062;
          Specify the name of the index node, which will be accessed
          by the Index button.  Can be a node in an external database.

          @MACRO &#060;name&#062; &#060;commands&#062;
          This is used to construct a macro.  A macro can be used the
          same way as an attribute command, and can only consist of
          other attribute commands or macros.  The macro list is
          searched before the attribute command list is searched.  This
          is new for V40.

              @macro icom &#034;@{i}$1 @{ui}&#034;

              ...

              This is an @{icom &#034;example&#034;} of macro.

          @MASTER &#060;path&#062;
          Complete path of the source document used to define this
          AmigaGuide database.

          @NODE &#060;name&#062; &#060;title&#062;
          Indicate the start of a node (page/article/section). The first
          node, or main node, must be named MAIN.  MAIN must be the master
          table of contents for the database.

          @ONCLOSE &#060;rxcommand&#062;
          This is used to specify an ARexx macro file to execute when
          the database is closed.  The return value of the script has no
          effect on the database.  New for V40.

          @ONOPEN &#060;rxcommand&#062;
          This is used to specify an ARexx macro file to execute when
          the database is opened.  If the script returns an error, then
          the database will not be opened.  New for V40.

          @REM &#060;remark&#062;
          @REMARK &#060;remark&#062;
          This is used to place remarks in the database.  These remarks
          are not displayed to the user.

          @SMARTWRAP
          This is used to indicate that the text of the database is to
          wordwrapped using a more intelligent algorithm than @WORDWRAP.
          A paragraph doesn't need to be restricted to one physical
          line, but paragraphs must be separated by two line feeds.
          New for V40.

          @TAB &#060;num&#062;
          Number of spaces in a tab.  Defaults to 8.  New for V40.

          @WIDTH &#060;chars&#062;
          How wide, in characters, the largest document is.

          @WORDWRAP
          Turn on wordwrapping for the whole database.  A paragraph must
          be restrained to one physical line.

        The following commands can be used within nodes of a database.

          \
          A backslash is the escape character.  A backslash in front of
          the @ sign is used to escape it. The backslash has no effect
          as an escape character inside commands such as @ONOPEN or
          @{&#034;..&#034; LINK ..}; in cases like these it is treated as a
          regular character.
          Please note that AmigaGuide V35 does not treat the backslash
          character as an escape character.

          @ENDNODE &#060;name&#062;
          Indicate the end of a node.  Must start at the beginning of a
          line.

          @FONT &#060;name&#062; &#060;size&#062;
          Specify the font to use for the node.

          @HELP &#060;name/node&#062;
          Specify the name of the help node, which will be accessed
          by the Help button.  Can be a node in an external database.

          @INDEX &#060;name/node&#062;
          Specify the name of the index node, which will be accessed
          by the Index button.  Can be a node in an external database.

          @KEYWORDS &#060;keywords&#062;
          Keywords of the node.  Someday when searching is
          reimplemented, there will be a keyword search.

          @NEXT &#060;node name&#062;
          Node to display when the user selects &#034;Browse &#062;&#034;

          @ONCLOSE &#060;rxcommand&#062;
          This is used to specify an ARexx macro file to execute when
          the node is closed.  The return value of the script has no
          effect on the node.  New for V40.

          @ONOPEN &#060;rxcommand&#062;
          This is used to specify an ARexx macro file to execute when
          the node is opened.  If the script returns an error, then
          the node will not be opened.  New for V40.

          @PREV &#060;node name&#062;

          wordwrapped using a more intelligent algorithm than @WORDWRAP.
          A paragraph doesn't need to be restricted to one physical
          line, but paragraphs must be separated by two line feeds.
          New for V40.

          @TAB &#060;num&#062;
          Number of spaces in a tab.  Defaults to 8.  New for V40.

          @TITLE &#060;title&#062;
          Title to display in the title bar of the window during the
          display of this node.  Must start at the beginning of a line.

          @TOC &#060;node name&#062;
          Name of the node that contains the table of contents for this
          node.  Defaults to MAIN.  This is the node that is displayed
          when the user presses the &#034;Contents&#034; button.
