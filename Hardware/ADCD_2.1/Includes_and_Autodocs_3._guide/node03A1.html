<b>    NAME </b>
	CloseWorkBench -- Closes the Workbench screen.

<b>    SYNOPSIS </b>
	Success = CloseWorkBench()
	D0

	<a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0654.html#line39">LONG</a> CloseWorkBench( VOID );

<b>    FUNCTION </b>
	This routine attempts to close the Workbench screen:
       -   Test whether or not any applications have opened windows on the
           Workbench, and return FALSE if so.  Otherwise ...
       -   Clean up all special buffers
       -   <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0149.html">Close</a> the Workbench screen
       -   Make the Workbench program mostly inactive (it will still
           monitor disk activity)
       -   Return TRUE

<b>    INPUTS </b>
	None

<b>    RESULT </b>
	TRUE if the Workbench screen closed successfully
	FALSE if the Workbench was not open, or if it has windows
	    open which are not Workbench drawers.

<b>   NOTES</b>
	This routine has been drastically rewritten for V36.
	It is much more solid, although we haven't eliminated
	all the problem cases yet.

<b>    BUGS </b>
	The name of this function is improperly spelled.  It ought
	to have been CloseWorkbench().

	It might be more convenient to have it return TRUE if the
	Workbench wasn't opened when called.  The idea as it is now
	is probably this: if you want to free up the memory of the
	Workbench screen when your program begins, you can call
	CloseWorkBench().  The return value of that call indicates
	whether you should call <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node03D7.html">OpenWorkBench()</a> when your program
	exits: if FALSE, that means either the the Workbench existed
	but you could not close it, or that it wasn't around to
	begin with, and you should not try to re-open it.

	We would prefer that you provide a user selection to attempt
	to open or close the Workbench screen from within your application,
	rather than your making assumptions like these.
