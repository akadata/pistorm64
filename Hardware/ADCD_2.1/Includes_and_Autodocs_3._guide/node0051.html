<b>    NAME</b>
        animation.datatype -- root data type for animations.

<b>    FUNCTION</b>
        The animation.datatype is the super-class for any animation related
        classes.

        This class is responsible for creating the controls, scaling,
        remapping and synchronization.

<b>    METHODS</b>
        OM_NEW -- Create a new animation object.

        OM_GET -- Obtain the value of an attribute.

        OM_SET -- Set the values of multiple attributes.

        OM_UPDATE -- Update the values of multiple attributes.

        OM_DISPOSE -- Dispose of a animation object.

        GM_LAYOUT -- Layout the object and notify the application of the
            title and size.

        GM_HITTEST -- Determine if the object has been hit with the
            mouse.

        GM_GOACTIVE -- Tell the object to go active.  On SELECTDOWN, the
            animation will start playing.

        GM_HANDLEINPUT -- Handle input.  Currently input (other than
            SELECTDOWN) doesn't affect the animation.

        GM_RENDER -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node01F4.html">Cause</a> the current frame to render.

        DTM_FRAMEBOX -- Obtain the display environment that the animation
            requires.

        DTM_TRIGGER -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node01F4.html">Cause</a> an event to occur.  Currently the only
            trigger event is STM_PLAY, which will cause the animation to
            start playing.

        DTM_COPY -- Copy the current frame to the clipboard as an IFF ILBM.

        DTM_WRITE -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node01D1.html">Write</a> the current frame to a file as an IFF ILBM.

        DTM_PRINT -- Print the current frame.

        ADTM_LOADFRAME -- Load a frame of the animation.

        ADTM_UNLOADFRAME -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node01FE.html">Deallocate</a> any memory allocated by
            ADTM_LOADFRAME.

        ADTM_START -- Start the animation.  This MUST be passed to the
            super-class AFTER the sub-class has started.

        ADTM_PAUSE -- Pause the animation.  This MUST be passed to the
            super-class BEFORE the sub-class pauses.

        ADTM_STOP -- Stop the animation.  This MUST be passed to the
            super-class BEFORE the sub-class stops.

        ADTM_LOCATE -- Used to locate a frame of the animation.

        ADTM_LOADNEWFORMATFRAME -- Load a new format frame of the animation,
            for more information, see <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html">&#060;datatypes/animationclass.h&#062;</a>. (V44)

        ADTM_UNLOADNEWFORMATFRAME -- <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node01FE.html">Deallocate</a> any memory allocated by
            ADTM_LOADNEWFORMATFRAME. (V44)

            Applicability is (I).

        DTA_Repeat (BOOL) -- Indicate whether the animation
            should loop. (V44)

            Default for this tag is FALSE. Applicability is (IS).

        ADTA_KeyFrame (struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05DC.html#line45">BitMap</a> *) -- Pointer to the key
            frame.

            second to play.

        ADTA_NumColors (WORD) -- Number of colors used by the frame.

            Applicability is (ISG).

        ADTA_ColorRegisters (struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05DD.html#line223">ColorRegister</a> *) -- Color table; its
            contents should match the colours in the ADTA_CRegs table.

            Applicability is (G).

        ADTA_CRegs (ULONG *) -- Color table to use with <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0329.html">SetRGB32CM()</a>.

            Applicability is (G).

        ADTA_GRegs (ULONG *) -- Color table; this table is initialized
            during the layout process and will contain the colours the
            picture will use after remapping. If no remapping takes
            place, these colours will match those in the ADTA_CRegs table.

        ADTA_ColorTable (UBYTE *) -- Shared pen table; this table is
            initialized during the layout process while the frames
            are being remapped.

            Applicability is (G).

        ADTA_ColorTable2 (UBYTE *) -- Shared pen table; in most places
            this table will be identical to the ADTA_ColorTable table.
            Some of the colours in this table might match the original
            colour palette a little better than the colours picked for
            the other table. The animation.datatype uses the two tables
            during remapping, alternating for each pixel.

            Applicability is (G).

        ADTA_Allocated (ULONG) --  OBSOLETE; DO NOT USE.

            Applicability is (G).

            In this context `allocated' refers to colours allocated via
            <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0306.html">graphics.library/ObtainBestPenA</a>.

            <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05DD.html">&#060;datatypes/pictureclass.h&#062;</a>

            Applicability is (G).

        ADTA_Sample (BYTE *) -- Pointer to sample data.

                  in V44.

            Applicability is (ISG).

        ADTA_SampleLength (ULONG) -- Length of sample data.

            if this is &#062; 0, it takes precendence over ADTA_Period.

            Applicability is (ISG).

        ADTA_PreloadFrameCount (ULONG) -- Number of frames to preload. (V44)
            Frames are preloaded when starting animation playback. The
            loader will attempt to keep at least this number of frames
            available for the display process. Note that when changing this
            attribute the change does not take effect immediately.

            Default for this tag is 10. Applicability is (ISG).

<b>    NOTES</b>
        The ADTM_LOADNEWFORMATFRAME and ADTM_UNLOADNEWFORMATFRAME methods
        operate on struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html#line228">adtNewFormatFrame</a> format messages. The
        <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html#line228">adtNewFormatFrame</a> message is an extension of the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html#line206">adtFrame</a> message
        with additional fields, such as required for stereo sound playback.
        By default, animation.datatype will load and unload frames allocated
        by its subclasses using the compatible ADTM_LOADFRAME and
        ADTM_UNLOADFRAME methods. If your subclass needs to use the extended
        <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html#line228">adtNewFormatFrame</a> format messages, it must say so by providing a
        list of supported methods for animation.datatype to query through
        the OM_GET/DTA_Methods tag. If both ADTM_LOADNEWFORMATFRAME and
        ADTM_UNLOADNEWFORMATFRAME are among the methods supported by your
        subclass, you will receive <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html#line228">adtNewFormatFrame</a> format messages instead
        of the compatible <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html#line206">adtFrame</a> messages.

        Please note that applications such as MultiView will query the
        methods supported by your class. Make sure that if you choose to
        implement support for the OM_GET/DTA_Methods tag the methods you
        return should also include the methods supported by your superclass.
        Otherwise, the user will be unable to use functions such as &#034;Copy&#034;
        or &#034;Print&#034;.

        Since the <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html#line228">adtNewFormatFrame</a> message format may be enhanced in future
        releases of animation.datatype, your subclass may access only
        structure members that are known to exist in the message. To find
        out which members are available, check the
        adtNewFormatFrame-&#062;alf_Size member; it contains the total length of
        the data structure (in bytes). <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05E0.html#line1429">Remember</a> which message length you
        require, then act accordingly. Please keep in mind that the
        structure member adtNewFormatFrame-&#062;alf_Size does not exist in the
        compatible <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D1.html#line206">adtFrame</a> message data structure.
