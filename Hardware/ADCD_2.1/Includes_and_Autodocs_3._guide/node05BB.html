<b>   NAME</b>
	AddAppMenuItemA - add a menu item to Workbench's list            (V36)
                         of AppMenuItems.

<b>   SYNOPSIS</b>
	AppMenuItem = AddAppMenuItemA(id, userdata, text, msgport, taglist)
	D0                            D0     D1      A0     A1       A2

	struct AppMenuItem *AddAppMenuItemA(ULONG, ULONG, char *,
	                                    struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node062E.html#line27">MsgPort</a> *,
	                                    struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node064C.html#line31">TagItem</a> *);

	Alternate, varargs version:
	struct AppMenuItem *AddAppMenuItem(ULONG, ULONG, char *,
	                                   struct <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node062E.html#line27">MsgPort</a> *,
	                                   tag1, data1,
	                                   tag2, data2,
	                                   ...
	                                   TAG_END );

<b>   FUNCTION</b>
	Attempt to add the text as a menu item to Workbench's list
	of AppMenuItems (the 'Tools' menu strip).

<b>   INPUTS</b>
	id - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by
	     Workbench.  Typical uses in C are in switch and case statements,
	     and in assembly language table lookup.
	userdata - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored
	           by Workbench.
	text - text for the menu item (char *); starting with V44, any menu
	       label consisting entirely of '-', '_' or '~' characters will
	       result in a separator bar to be added in place of a textual
	       item.
	msgport - pointer to message port Workbench will use to send you an
	          <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05D6.html#line115">AppMessage</a> message of type 'MTYPE_APPMENUITEM' when your
	          menuitem gets selected.
	taglist - ptr to a list of tag items.  Must be NULL for V2.0.

<b>   TAGS</b>
	WBAPPMENUA_CommandKeyString (STRPTR) -- Command key to assign to
	    this AppMenu. This must be a NUL-terminated string. If the
	    string is empty, it will be ignored. Also, if the command key
	    is already in use by a different menu item it will be ignored,
	    too. In any case, only the first character of the string will
	    be used (V44).

	    This tag defaults to NULL.

<b>   RESULTS</b>
	AppMenuItem - a pointer to an appmenuitem structure which you pass to
	              <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05C3.html">RemoveAppMenuItem</a> when you want to remove the menuitem
	              from Workbench's list of AppMenuItems.  NULL if
	              workbench was unable to add your menu item; typically
	              happens when Workbench is not running or under low
	              memory conditions.

	          Starting with V44 NULL will be returned if you attempt to
	          add an AppMenu item to a menu which already contains 63
	          menu items.

<b>   NOTES</b>
	For this function call to succeed, Workbench must be open. This
	means that the LoadWB command was executed and the Workbench
	screen has been opened.

<b>   SEE ALSO</b>
	<a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node05C3.html">workbench.library/RemoveAppMenuItem</a>

<b>   BUGS</b>
	workbench.library V37 through V40 does not limit the number of menu
	items to 63. Any menu items after the 63rd will not be selectable.
	This bug was fixed in V44.
