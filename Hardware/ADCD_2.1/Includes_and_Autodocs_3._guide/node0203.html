<b>    NAME</b>
	Disable -- disable interrupt processing.

<b>    SYNOPSIS</b>
	Disable();

	void Disable(void);

<b>    FUNCTION</b>
	Prevents interrupts from being handled by the system, until a
	matching <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0205.html">Enable()</a> is executed.  Disable() implies <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node020C.html">Forbid()</a>.

	DO NOT USE THIS CALL WITHOUT GOOD JUSTIFICATION.  THIS CALL IS
	VERY DANGEROUS!

<b>    RESULTS</b>
	All interrupt processing is deferred until the task executing makes
	a call to <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0205.html">Enable()</a> or is placed in a wait state.  Normal task
	rescheduling does not occur while interrupts are disabled.  In order
	to restore normal interrupt processing, the programmer must execute
	exactly one call to <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0205.html">Enable()</a> for every call to Disable().

	IMPORTANT REMINDER:

	It is important to remember that there is a danger in using
	disabled sections.  Disabling interrupts for more than ~250
	microseconds will prevent vital system functions (especially serial
	I/0) from operating in a normal fashion.

	Think twice before using Disable(), then think once more.
	After all that, think again.  With enough thought, the need
	for a Disable() can often be eliminated.  For the user of many
	device drivers, a write to disable *only* the particular interrupt
	of interest can replace a Disable().  For example:
			MOVE.W	#INTF_PORTS,_intena
	Do not use a macro for Disable(), insist on the real thing.

	This call may be made from interrupts, it will have the effect
	of locking out all higher-level interrupts (lower-level interrupts
	are automatically disabled by the CPU).

        Note: In the event of a task entering a <a href="../Includes_and_Autodocs_3._guide/node0246.html">Wait()</a> after disabling
              interrupts, the system &#034;breaks&#034; the disabled state and runs
              normally until the task which called Disable() is rescheduled.

<b>    NOTE</b>
	This call is guaranteed to preserve all registers.
