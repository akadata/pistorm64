 * This is a basically a skeleton of a UserShell.  A UserShell is a special
 * shell that can replace the default system shell.  It has to meets some
 * system requirements to function as a system shell.  This example takes care
 * of all of those requirements. To make this shell the system shell, use the
 * resident command:
 *
 * resident shell MyShell SYSTEM
 *
 * Because this shell only serves as an minimal example of a UserShell and does
 * not do many of the standard functions a shell normally performs.  It is
 * limited to the commands from the resident list (which would make it a bad
 * idea to add this shell to the resident list if you need a useable default
 * shell!)
