Class:                  rootclass
Superclass:             None
Description:            Base class for all other classes
Include File:           &#060;intuition/classusr.h&#062;


New Methods:
------------

OM_NEW - Create a new object.  This method is passed a pointer to the
&#034;true class&#034; of the object in place of the yet to be created object.
The Root class will allocate enough memory for all the instance data of
the true class.


OM_DISPOSE - Delete an object.  This method will free the same amount of
memory as allocated by OM_NEW.


OM_ADDTAIL - Add an object to an Exec list, based on a MinNode in the
private rootclass object header.  You can provide any Exec list you
want, and iterate the objects on the list using the Intuition function
NextObject().


OM_REMOVE  - Remove an object from an Exec list.


The following methods are defined for all objects, but are no-ops in the
rootclass.  Implementation for specific subclasses is done to support
these conventions.


OM_ADDMEMBER - Add some object (passed to the method) to the objects
list, which is defined by the class.  Examples include the broadcast
list of modelclass objects, and the component gadgets of a groupgclass
object.  This is typically implemented by sending the OM_ADDTAIL message
to the member object.


OM_REMMEMBER - Remove a member object previously added by OM_ADDMEMBER.
You typically send the OM_REMOVE message to the member object.


OM_SET - Set attributes from passed attribute list.  The Root class
defines no attributes.


OM_GET - Retrieve an attribute.


OM_UPDATE - &#034;Be updated&#034; of external changes.  A no-op for rootclass.


OM_NOTIFY - Notify other of changes provided in the message.  A no-op
for the root class.


Changed Methods:
----------------

Not applicable.
