Full support for the A570 does require a certain amount of effort on
behalf of the CDTV developer.  Many of these points are also relevant
for those CDTV owners that expand their unit to be an Amiga.

Remember, you are not obliged to support all these features.  Many CDTV
applications take over total control of the system, and are not
designed to multitask.  There is nothing wrong with doing this, even if
you want your title to run on the A570.  If you include Level One
support, you can insist that your title be booted directly from the CD.
It is better to have a title which runs perfectly on the CDTV than one
which is awkward to use on both the CDTV and the A570.
