29. A title must be playable to completion.  No user or program error
  should prohibit the game from continuing. If you make a stupid move and
  get eaten by a dragon and the game ends, you have played to completion.
  If you make an incorrect move and the game freezes up or prohibits the
  continuation of play, it is a not move that shouldn't have been made,
  it is a bug.

30. A multiple player option should be in every recreational product.
  Where it makes sense (certain sports and arcade games), two-player
  simultaneous play is a requirement (e.g., hockey and football).

31. Simulations must attempt to match the real world in as much detail
  as possible, including the standard rules of play in sports games.
