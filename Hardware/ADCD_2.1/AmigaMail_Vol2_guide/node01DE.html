                      ------- NOTE NOTE -------

Developers, please note ...  The standard system location for SANA-II
network device drivers is in a directory called 'sana2' which exists
in the &#034;DEVS:&#034; directory.  Example:

devs:sana2/a2065.device

This is the official location for these drivers. It may be necessary
for your install programs/scripts to create this directory.

                      ------- NOTE NOTE -------

The included A2060 device driver is a BETA driver and should be dealt
with accordingly. At the time of this writing the driveer has NOT
received the testing that it should.  You can get our attention on
this subject via email to 'networking@cbmvax.commodore.com'. Please
let us know of any problems so we can fix them a.s.a.p.
