AmigaDOS Packet Interface Specification

by John Toebes


AmigaDOS communicates with file systems and other DOS handlers by
sending and receiving packets.  Opening and closing file handles
(including console file handles), creating directories, and renaming
disks all require DOS to tell a handler to perform these actions
through sending a packet.  The particular action a handler performs
depends on the type of packet it receives.

This article documents the standard AmigaDOS packet types.  For
information on how to use packets to communicate with handlers see
the AmigaDOS Manual.

Packets sent to a file system or handler can be divided into several
basic categories:

    o   <a href="../AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node005F.html">Basic Input/Output</a>

These actions deal with tranferring data to and from objects
controlled by the handler.

    o   <a href="../AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node0060.html">File/Directory Manipulation/Information</a>

These actions are used to gain access to and manipulate the high
level structures of the file system.

    o   <a href="../AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node0061.html">Volume Manipulation/Information</a>

These actions allow access to the specific volume controlled by the
file system.

    o   <a href="../AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node0062.html">Handler Maintenance and Control</a>

These allow control over the handler/file system itself, independent
of the actual volume or structure underneath.

    o   <a href="../AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node0063.html">Handler Internal</a>

These actions are never sent to the handler directly.  Instead they
are generally responses to IO requests made by the handler.  The
handler makes these responses look like packets in order to simplify
processing.

    o   <a href="../AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node0064.html">Obsolete Packets</a>

These packets are no longer valid for use by handlers and file
systems.

    o   <a href="../AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node0065.html">Console Only Packets</a>

These packets are specific to console handlers.  File Systems can
ignore these packets.


Much of this information can be extracted from Developer Conference
notes, The AmigaDOS Manual, and various Fred Fish disks.  However,
because there is no single complete reference to these packet types,
a consolidated view of all the packets is presented here.  Several
structures are referenced here which can be found by looking at the
include files &#060;dos/dos.h&#062; and &#060;dos/dosextens.h&#062;.  (If you are using
the 1.3 version of the include files, these are in the libraries
directory instead of the dos directory).  Before attempting to work
with a file handler you should first become familiar with these files.

Each packet type documented in this article is listed with its action
name, its corresponding number, any AmigaDOS routines which uses this
packet, and the list of  parameters that the packets uses.  The C
variable types for the packet parameters are one of the following
types:


BPTR    This is BCPL pointer (the address of the given object shifted
        right by 2).  Note: this means that the object must be
        aligned on a longword boundary.


LOCK    This is a BPTR to a FileLock structure returned by a previous
        ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT.  A lock of 0 is legal, indicating the
        root of the volume for the handler.


BSTR    This is a BPTR to a string where the first byte indicates the
        number of characters in the string.  This length byte is
        unsigned but because it is stored in a byte, the strings are
        limited to 255 characters in length.


BOOL    A 32-bit boolean value either containing DOSTRUE (-1) or
        DOSFALSE (0).  Note: equality comparisons with DOSTRUE should
        be avoided.


CODE    A 32 bit error code as defined in the dos/dos.h include file.
        Handlers should not return error codes besides those defined
        in dos/dos.h.


ARG1    The FileHandle-&#062;fh_Arg1 field.


LONG    A 32 bit integer value.



Summary of Defined Packet Numbers

This is a listing of all the DOS packets defined by Commodore.
Packets 0-1999 are reserved for use by Commodore.  Unless otherwise
noted, packets 2050-2999 are reserved for use by third party
developers (see chart below).  The remaining packets are reserved for
future expansion (Note: packets 2008, 2009, 4097, and 4098 are in use
by Commodore).
