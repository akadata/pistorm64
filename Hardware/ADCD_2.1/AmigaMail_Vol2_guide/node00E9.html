This chunk describes the on-off dash pattern associated with a line.

    struct DASHstruct {
        ULONG       ID;
        ULONG       Size;
        USHORT      DashID;                 /* ID of the dash pattern */
        USHORT      NumDashes;              /* Should always be even */
        IEEE        Dashes[NumDashes];      /* On-off pattern */
    };

DashID is the number assigned to this specific dash pattern.
References to this dash pattern by other DR2D chunks are made using
this number.

The Dashes[] array contains the actual dash pattern.  The first number
in the array (element 0) is the length of the &#034;on&#034; portion of the
pattern.  The second number (element 1) specifies the &#034;off&#034; portion
of the pattern.  If there are more entries in the Dashes array, the
pattern will continue.  Even-index elements specify the length of an
&#034;on&#034; span, while odd-index elements specify the length of an &#034;off&#034;
span.  There must be an even number of entries.  These lengths are not
in the same units as specified in the PPRF chunk, but are multiples of
the line width, so a line of width 2.5 and a dash pattern of 1.0, 2.0
would have an &#034;on&#034; span of length 1.0 x 2.5 = 2.5 followed by an
&#034;off&#034; span of length 2.0 x 2.5 = 5.  The following figure shows
several dash pattern examples.  Notice that for lines longer than the
dash pattern, the pattern repeats.

   <a href="../AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/node01D4.html">figure 1 - dash patterns</a> 

By convention, DashID 0 is reserved to mean `No line pattern at all',
i.e. the edges are invisible.  This DASH pattern should not be defined
by a DR2D DASH chunk.  Again by convention, a NumDashes of 0 means
that the line is solid.
