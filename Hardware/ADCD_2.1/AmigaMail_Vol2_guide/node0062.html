A number of packets are defined to give an application some control
over a file system:


ACTION_DIE               5      &#060;sendpkt only&#062;
RES1:   BOOL    DOSTRUE

As its name implies, the ACTION_DIE packet tells a handler to quit.
All new handlers are expected to implement this packet.  Because of
outstanding locks and the fact that the handler address is returned
by the DeviceProc() routine, it is unlikely that the handler can
disappear completely, but instead will have to release as many
resources as possible and simply return an error on all packets sent
to it.

In the future, the system may be able to determine if there are any
outstanding DeviceProc() references to a handler, and therefore make
it is safe to shut down completely.


ACTION_FLUSH             27     &#060;sendpkt only&#062;
RES1:   BOOL    DOSTRUE

This action causes the file system to flush out all buffers to disk
before returning this packet.  If any writes are pending, they must
be processed before responding to this packet.  This packet allows an
application to make sure that the data that is supposed to be on the
disk is actually written to the disk instead of waiting in a buffer.


ACTION_MORE_CACHE        18      AddBuffers(...) in 2.0
ARG1:   LONG    Number of buffers to add

RES1:   BOOL    DOSTRUE (-1L)
RES2:   LONG    New total number of buffers

This action allows an application to change the number of internal
buffers used by the file system for caching.  Note that a positive
number increases the number of buffers while a negative number
decreases the number of buffers.  In all cases, the number of current
buffers should be returned in RES2.  This allows an application to
inquire the number of buffers by sending in a value of 0 (resulting
in no change).  Note that the OFS and FFS in 1.3 do not accept a
negative number of buffers.

Note that there is a bug in the ROM file system in both Release 2.04
and Release 3.0 that jumbles its return values for this packet.  The
file system erroneously returns the new number of buffers in RES1
instead of RES2 (it returns a failure code in RES2).  To work around
this bug when using this packet, test RES1 to see if it is DOSTRUE
(-1L).  If it is, look at RES2 for the number of buffers, otherwise
RES1 should contain the new total number of buffers.


ACTION_INHIBIT           31     Inhibit(...) in 2.0
ARG1:   BOOL    DOSTRUE = inhibit,      DOSFALSE = uninhibit

RES1:   BOOL    Success/failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE)

This action is probably one of the most dangerous that a file system
has to handle.  When inhibited (ARG1 = DOSTRUE), the file system must
not access any underlying media and return an error code on all
attempts to access the device.  Once uninhibited (ARG1 = DOSFALSE),
the file system must assume that the medium has been changed.  The
file system must flush the buffers before the ACTION_INHIBIT ,
popping up a requester demanding that the user put back the current
disk, if necessary.  The handler may choose to reject an inhibit
request if any objects are open for writing.

Although it's not required, a handler should nest inhibits.  Prior to
2.0, the system handlers did not keep a nesting count and were
subject to some obscure race conditions.  The 2.0 ROM filing system
introduced a nesting count.


ACTION_WRITE_PROTECT     1023    &#060;sendpkt only&#062;
ARG1:   BOOL    DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE (write protect/un-write protect)
ARG2:   LONG    32 Bit pass key

RES1:   BOOL    DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE

This is a new packet defined for the Fast File System.  This packet
allows an application to change the write protect flag of a disk (if
possible - applications cannot write to floppies that have their
write-protect tabs set).  This packet is primarily intended to allow
write-protecting non-removable media such as hard disks.  The value
in ARG1 toggles the write status.  The 32-bit passkey allows a
program to prevent other programs from unwrite-protecting a disk.  To
unlock a disk, ARG2 must match the passkey of the packet that locked
the disk, unless the disk was locked with a passkey of 0.  In this
case, no passkey is necessary to unlock the disk.


ACTION_IS_FILESYSTEM     1027    IsFileSystem(devname)

RES1:   BOOL    Success/Failure (DOSTRUE/DOSFALSE)
RES2:   CODE    Failure code if RES1 is DOSFALSE

Through this function, a handler can indicates whether or not it is a
file system (whether or not it can  support separate files for
storing information).  Programs will assume a handler can create
multiple, distinct files through calls to Open() if the handler
returns this packet with a DOSTRUE value.  A handler does not need to
support directories and subdirectories in order to qualify as a file
system.  It does have to support the Examine()/ExNext() calls.

Note that the AmigaDOS routine IsFileSystem() will attempt to use
Lock(&#034;:&#034;,SHARED_ACCESS) if this packet returns ERROR_ACTION_NOT_KNOWN.
