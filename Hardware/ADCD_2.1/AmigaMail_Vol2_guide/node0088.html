NAME
    CachePreDMA - Take actions prior to hardware DMA  (V37)

SYNOPSIS
    paddress = CachePreDMA(vaddress,&#038;length,flags)
    d0                     a0       a1      d0

    APTR CachePreDMA(APTR,LONG *,ULONG);

FUNCTION
    Take all appropriate steps before Direct Memory Access (DMA).  This
    function is primarily intended for writers of DMA device drivers.  The
    action will depend on the CPU type installed, caching modes, and the
    state of any Memory Management Unit (MMU) activity.

    This function supports advanced cache architectures that have
    &#034;copyback&#034; modes.  With copyback, write data may be cached, but not
    actually flushed out to memory.  If the CPU has unflushed data at the
    time of DMA, data may be lost.

    As implemented
            68000 - Do nothing
            68010 - Do nothing
            68020 - Do nothing
            68030 - Do nothing
            68040 - Write any matching dirty cache lines back to memory.
                    As a side effect of the 68040's design, matching data
                    cache lines are also invalidated -- future CPUs may
                    be different.
            ????? - External cache boards, Virtual Memory Systems, or
                    future hardware may patch this vector to best emulate
                    the intended behavior.
                    With a Bus-Snooping CPU, this function my end up
                    doing nothing.

INPUTS
    address - Base address to start the action.
    length  - Pointer to a longword with a length.
    flags   - Values:
                    DMA_Continue - Indicates this call is to complete
                    a prior request that was broken up.

RESULTS
    paddress- Physical address that coresponds to the input virtual
              address.
    &#038;length - This length value will be updated to reflect the contiguous
              length of physical memory present at paddress.  This may
              be smaller than the requested length.  To get the mapping
              for the next chunk of memory, call the function again with
              a new address, length, and the DMA_Continue flag.

NOTE
    Due to processor granularity, areas outside of the address range
    may be affected by the cache flushing actions.  Care has been taken
    to ensure that no harm is done outside the range, and that activities
    on overlapping cache lines won't harm data.
