   DESCRIPTION

	timezone.library maintains a global environment variable called "TZONE"
	which contains current time zone names and UTC (GMT) offsets.

	The TZONE variable has the following format:

	  std offset [dst [offset]]

	NOTE: spaces are for clarity only and should be omitted.

	Where:

	std and dst
	Are 3 or more characters specifying the local standard and daylight
	saving time (DST) zone names.

	offset
	The form [-]hh:[mm[:ss]] and specifies the offset west of UTC.

	If there is no offset following dst, daylight saving time is one hour
	ahead of standard time.

	If the 'dst offset' part is absent, system time represents standard
	time, if it is present, system time means daylight saving time.

	offset
	Always specifies the absolute offset of the zone from UTC so if standard
	time applies, 'std offset' part should be used and if DST is in effect,
	the 'dst offset' should be used.

   EXAMPLE

	EST5

	Standard time is in effect, the current timezone is called EST and you
	are 5 hours west of UTC.


	CST-9:30CST-10:30

	DST is in effect, the current timezone is called CST and you are 10 hours,
	30 minutes east of UTC.


	CET-1CEST
	DST is in effect, the current timezone is called CEST and you are 2 hours
	east of UTC.

   NAME
      GetTimezoneAttrsA -- Obtain timezone attributes.
      GetTimezoneAttrs -- Vararg stub for GetTimezoneAttrsA().

   SYNOPSIS
      uint32 retval = GetTimezoneAttrsA(struct TagList *cltags,
                                        struct TagList *taglist);

      uint32 retval = GetTimezoneAttrs(struct TagList *cltags,
                                       Tag tag1, ...);

   FUNCTION
       This function is used to get certain timezone attributes.

   INPUTS
       cltags - tag list of attributes describing the time zone to get
            information for, terminated with TAG_END.
            When NULL, the system's current time zone is used.
            As of now, the following tags can be used:

            TZA_CountryCode (CONST_STRPTR)
            Country code of desired time zone.

            TZA_CountryName (CONST_STRPTR)
            Country name of desired time zone.

            TZA_RuleName (CONST_STRPTR)
            Name of desired time zone rule.

            TZA_UTCOffsetSTD (int32 *)
            Offset between standard time and UTC of desired time zone.

       taglist - tag list of attributes to get, terminated with TAG_END.
            ti_Tag is the attribute to get and ti_Data is a pointer to a
            location to copy the result to.

   TAGS
       TZA_Timezone (STRPTR)

       Copies a three or more letter abbreviation for the local standard or
       daylight saving time zone.
       The destination must be large enough to hold MAX_TZSIZE characters.

       TZA_TimezoneSTD (STRPTR)

       Copies a three or more letter abbreviation for the local standard time
       zone.
       The destination must be large enough to hold MAX_TZSIZE characters.

       TZA_TimezoneDST (STRPTR)

       Copies a three or more letter abbreviation for the local daylight
       saving time zone.
       The destination must be large enough to hold MAX_TZSIZE characters.

       TZA_UTCOffset (int32 *)

       Offset between local time and Universal Time Coordinated (UTC,
       formerly referred to as "Greenwich Mean Time" GMT) in minutes.

       TZA_UTCOffsetSTD (int32 *)

       Offset between local standard time and UTC in minutes.

       TZA_UTCOffsetDST (int32 *)

       Offset between local daylight saving time and UTC in minutes.

       TZA_UTCOffsetRFC (STRPTR)

       Copies the offset in minutes between local time and UTC in an RFC 2822
       compliant form.
       The destination must be large enough to hold MAX_RFCSIZE characters.

       TZA_DSTStart (uint32 *)

       Number of seconds from 01-Jan-1978 to the date of the beginning
       of DST.

       TZA_DSTEnd (uint32 *)

       Number of seconds from 01-Jan-1978 to the date of the end of DST.

       TZA_NextDSTSwitch (uint32 *)

       Number of seconds from 01-Jan-1978 to the date of the next DST switch.

       TZA_TimeFlag (int8 *)

       Tells whether standard or daylight saving time is in effect.
       Current values are:
           TFLG_ISSTD:     Standard time is in effect for current location
           TFLG_ISDST:     Daylight saving time is in effect for current
                           location
           TFLG_UNKNOWN:   Unknown whether standard or daylight saving time
                           is in effect

   RESULT
       The number of GUI attributes successfully retrieved.

      uint32 retval = SetTimezoneAttrs(APTR unused, Tag tag1, ...);

   FUNCTION
       This function is used to set certain timezone attributes.

   INPUTS
       unused  - currently unused, should be NULL for now.
       taglist - tag list of attributes to change, terminated with TAG_END.

   TAGS
       There are currently no public tags available.
