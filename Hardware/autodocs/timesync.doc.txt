   NAME
	RemoteSyncA -- Get/set time from a remote timeserver.
	RemoteSync -- Varargs stub for RemoteSyncA().

   SYNOPSIS
	result = RemoteSyncA( TagList )
	D0                    A0

	ULONG RemoteSyncA( struct TagItem * )

	result = RemoteSync( Tag1, ... )

	ULONG RemoteSync( Tag, ... )

   FUNCTION
	This function tries to retrieve time from a remote timeserver and is able to
	set system time and/or the hardware clock.

   INPUTS
	TagList = array of TagItem structures with attribute/value pairs.

   TAGS
	RS_PROTOCOL (UBYTE)

	Specify which protocol should be used.
	Currently only the Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be used by default.

	RS_SERVER (STRPTR)

	Specifies the name of the remote server.
	When set to 'PREFS' the time server specified from the Time prefs editor
	will be used.

	RS_PORT (ULONG)

	Specify a port number >0 to be used when talking to the remote server.
	Currently defaults to '123'.
	When RS_SERVER is set to 'PREFS' the port number specified from the Time
	prefs editor will be used.

	RS_UTCOFFSET (LONG)

	Specify the offset in seconds between local time and Coordinated Universal
	Time (UTC, formerly referred to as "Greenwich Mean Time" GMT).
	Defaults to using the offset from Timezone or Locale.
	When RS_SERVER is set to 'PREFS' the UTC offset specified from the Time
	prefs editor will be used.

	RS_SETSYSTIME (BOOL)

	Set to TRUE when the current system time shall be changed to reflect
	the time from the remote server.
	Defaults to TRUE.

	RS_SAVETIME (BOOL)

	Set to TRUE when the battery backed clock shall be changed to reflect
	the time from the remote server.
	Defaults to FALSE.

	RS_DIFFTIME (struct timeval *)

	Specify a pointer to a timeval which will hold the difference between
	current system	time and the time from the remote server.
	Defaults to NULL.

	RS_ERRSTR (STRPTR *)

	Specify a pointer to a STRPTR which will contain an error message if the
	time couldn't be retrieved successfully from the remote server.
	Defaults to NULL.

	RS_ERRNO (LONG *)

	Specify a pointer to LONG which will contain a socket error code if the
	time couldn't be retrieved successfully from the remote server.
	Defaults to NULL.
	Error codes are defined in <libraries/timesync.h>.

   RESULTS
	result - TSERR_NONE or an error code from TSERR_INVALID to TSERR_FAIL.
	Error codes are defined in <libraries/timesync.h>.
