  XCopy 5.3

*************

UPDATES
-------

- The reset-routine when exiting the KILLSYS'ed XCopy is removed, because
  I don't know how to perform a reset which will work on ALL Amigas.

- A viruschecker now checks your source disks for bootblock-virus
  infection!
  Everytime you copy a disk with DOSCOPY, DOSCOPY+, BAMCOPY+ or if you
  perform a CHECKDISK, your source disk is checked for viruses. If
  XCopy detects one of these bastards, an ASCII-Dump of the bootblock
  will be shown and you are able to kill the virus off your disks by
  clicking on the KILL gadget! If you choose CONTINUE, you can let it
  live (this is only implemented for the case that XCopy detects a 
  harmless bootblock as a virus).
  You may use XCopy as some kind of standalone-viruschecker, too. Just
  alter the endtrack to "00" and perform CHECKDISKS on your disks. This
  only checks cylinder 0 on which these viruses live.

  The following bootblock-viruses will be detected in this release:

  SCA                     LSD                     AEK

- The german version of XCopy now has a german keymap.


BUG FIXES
---------

- KILLSYS now works with an enabled 68030 Data Cache.
  The KILLSYS'ed XCopy uses your CHIP memory and the first Non-CHIP memory
  block in the system's memory list. If you have more than one RAM-
  Expansion (e.g. a 512K $C00000-RAM Card plugged into the internal RAM
  slot and another 2 meg RAM Expansion on the expansion port) you should
  always call "FastMemFirst" to move the RAM-Expansion hooked up into
  the expansion port to first in list. This should also be done, because
  $C00000 RAM is very slooooow.
  NOTE: There is NO NEED to use KILLSYS on machines which have more than
  1 meg of RAM! KILLSYS isn't faster nor better, it just gives you more
  memory if you DON'T have enough!

- KILLSYS now works on 1MB ChipMem-Only machines, like the A500-plus.

- VBR bug removed. Since the 68010 processor, it is possible to move the
  trap vectors to a different memory location (e.g. with a tool called 
  VBR). XCopy wanted the vectors at their origin position. Thanx Carnivore!

- The bootblock installation in INSTALL, QFORMAT and FORMAT didn't correct
  the checksums for the bootblocks sometimes. Fixed.

  XCopy 5.21

*************

UPDATES
-------

- If you copy a disk with DOSCOPY and a read error occurs, XCopy tries
  three times to re-read the damaged track, if that fails it continues
  with NIBBLE-mode. But nevertheless a green '0' appears it seems as
  if the track got repaired. But this green '0' was "NIBBLE OK" and the
  read error is still on the destination disk!
  I changed it this way:
  When a read error appears in DOSCOPY-mode, it still NIBBLE's the
  track, but the red number stays visible, because it is still a read
  error.


*************

  XCopy 5.2

*************

UPDATES
-------

- New DRIVES ON function which enables you to switch on drives after you
  started XCopy and use them.

- Bootblock selection moved from requester to status line (via keyboard)
  for faster handling.


BUG FIXES
---------

- Diskchange on exit didn't do a diskchange on the correct drives.

- OPTIMIZE works now.



*************

  XCopy 5.1

*************

UPDATES
-------

- When copying in "KILLSYS" mode, you are now able to copy a whole disk without
  swapping via "RAM" with BAMCOPY, DOSCOPY and DOSCOPY+ on 1MB machines.

- When exiting XCopy a Diskchange is performed, so the system gets informed
  about a change of disk-contents after formatting etc.
  A requester will prompts you to eject equal disks when there is more than 1
  disk inserted, because AmigaDOS gets upset when there are two or more equal
  disks (same diskname) inserted.


BUG FIXES
---------

- CHIP-Memory gets detected correctly after a "KILLSYS" now. It sometimes
  detected too much CHIP-Memory on 1MB CHIP-Memory systems like the new
  A2000/500's.

- The sound is now switched off, if the "STOP" button is pressed while a
  previous sound is still played.

- Mouse movement now works even if the mouse is moved extremly slow.

- XCopy now doesn' hang up, when a drive is still busy at startup.

- XCopy 5.0 crashed the trackdisk tasks under OS-2.0. It is fixed now.


MINOR FIXES
-----------

- Text flickering is avoided when being in text input mode (like "FORMAT").
