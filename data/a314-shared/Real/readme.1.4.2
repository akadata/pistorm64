This file contains information about the new features not described in 
the manual. 


Using custom display devices from Real 3D
-----------------------------------------

The program package contains currently the following libraries for 
additional display device support:

- hr_r3d.library for ACS Harlequin
- vd_r3d.library for VD2001
- dctv_r3d.library for DCTV

The custom display image saving has been changed slightly. Now there is 
only one save function included in the frame buffer menu. After rendering 
an image to the custom display, you can save it as a true 24 bit image by 
selecting either TARGA or IFF 24 gadget and then selecting the save 
function. If neither TARGA nor IFF 24 gadget is selected, then Real 3D
tries to save the image by calling a custom image saving function of the 
library, which possibly saves the custom display image in its native
format instead of the standard 24 bit formats. For example, if the custom
display is not a true 24 bit display, there are probably more memory 
efficient ways to save the image. Also, the function can be used for 
faster image saving, because line based data transfer in the standard 24 bit 
saving inevitably requires extra data moving and format transformations, 
and is consiquently somewhat slow. Nevertheless, a proper implementation 
of custom format saving is optional; the library may contain a non-operational 
function instead. Read the library specific documentation file for further
details.

With this free version of REAL 3D we offer you the possiblity to update to
REAL 3D V2.5 Amiga/Windows, REAL 3D V3.0 Amiga/Windows at a specially
reduced price.
